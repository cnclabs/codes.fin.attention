item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained elsewhere in this form k is incorporated herein by reference 
business strategy the company s goal is to grow its business and increase revenues and profitability while continuing to be its customers provider of choice for high performance alloys 
the company intends to penetrate and capitalize on growth in its end markets by taking advantage of its diverse product offerings and service capabilities and to continue to increase capacity and lower costs through strategic investment in manufacturing facilities 
in order to accomplish these goals  the company intends to pursue the following capitalize on strategic equipment investment 
the company expects to continue to improve operating efficiencies through ongoing capital investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment 
recent investment in equipment has significantly improved the company s operating efficiency by increasing capacity  reducing unplanned downtime and manufacturing costs  and improving product quality  and is expected to improve working capital management 
because the company is one of the few manufacturers with the expertise and facilities to produce high performance alloys  management believes that the company s investments will enable it to continue to satisfy long term increased customer demand for value added products that meet precise specifications 
increase sales by providing value added processing services 
the company believes that its network of service and sales centers throughout north america  europe and asia distinguishes it from its competitors 
the company s service and sales centers enable it to develop close customer relationships through direct interaction and to respond to customer orders quickly while providing value added services such as laser and water jet processing 
these services allow the company s customers to minimize their processing costs and outsource non core activities 
in addition  the company s rapid response time and enhanced processing services for products shipped from its service and sales centers have allowed it to maintain a selling price advantage 
increase worldwide sales through international service and sales centers 
the company intends to continue its efforts to increase its sales to non us customers 
in recent years  the company opened a service and sales center in china  the first service and sales center operated by any manufacturer of nickel or cobalt based alloys in china  and opened sales centers in singapore  india and italy 
the company continues to evaluate its world wide distribution and sales network in order to provide improved services 
continue to expand its maintenance  repair and overhaul business 
the company believes that its maintenance  repair and overhaul  or mro  business serves a growing market and represents both an expanding and recurring revenue stream 
products used in the company s end markets require periodic replacement due to the extreme environments in which they are used  which drives demand for recurring mro work 
the company intends to continue to leverage the capabilities of its service and sales centers to respond quickly to its customers time sensitive mro needs to develop new and retain existing business opportunities 
increase revenue by developing new products and new applications for existing alloys 
the company believes that it is the industry leader in developing new alloys designed to meet its customers specialized and demanding requirements 
the company continues to work closely with customers and end users of its products to identify  develop  manufacture and test new high performance alloys 
since fiscal  the company s technical programs have yielded six new proprietary alloys  an accomplishment that the company believes distinguishes it from its competitors 
the company expects continued emphasis on product innovation to yield similar future results  and expects to focus its development efforts on specialized automotive products  the biopharmaceutical industry  the energy market for fuel cells and the market for turbine components for higher temperature operations 
expand product capability through strategic acquisitions and alliances 
the company will continue to examine opportunities that enable it to offer customers an enhanced and more competitive product line to complement its core flat products 
these opportunities may include product line enhancement  such as that provided by the acquisition of certain assets of the branford wire company in november and market expansion opportunities such as that provided per the acquisition of hw limited in fiscal the company will continue to look for opportunities that will enhance the portfolio of products provided to customers such as wire  tubing  fittings and bar 
the company will also continue to evaluate strategic relationships with third parties in the industry in order to enhance its competitive position and relationships with customers  including distribution agreements and agreements similar to the year conversion agreement the company entered into with titanium metals corporation  or timet  in november company history the company began operations in as the haynes stellite works  which was purchased by union carbide and carbon corporation in in  the operations were sold to cabot corporation 
in  haynes was incorporated as a stand alone corporation in delaware  and in haynes was sold by cabot corporation to morgan lewis githens ahn inc  a private investment firm 
the blackstone group  a private investment firm  purchased haynes from morgan lewis githens ahn inc in haynes encountered liquidity difficulties throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal due to concurrent downcycles in its largest markets  and rising raw material and energy costs  the company could not generate sufficient cash to both satisfy its debt service obligations and fund operations 
on march   haynes and its us subsidiaries and affiliates as of that date filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
from march  through august   haynes continued to operate as debtor in possession subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy court 
on august   haynes emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to a court approved plan of reorganization 
prior to the reorganization  all of the outstanding shares of its common stock were owned by haynes holdings  inc  a delaware corporation 
in connection with the reorganization  haynes holdings  inc and haynes international  inc were merged  and haynes was the surviving corporation of the merger 
pursuant to the plan of reorganization  all of the shares of the company s common stock were cancelled  and million new shares of the company s common stock  were issued in connection with its emergence from bankruptcy 
under the terms of the plan of reorganization  each former holder of the company s senior notes due september  received its pro rata share of million shares of the company s new common stock in full satisfaction of all of the company s obligations under the senior notes 
additionally  each former holder of the shares of common stock of haynes holdings  inc received its pro rata share of the remaining  shares of the company s new common stock in exchange for its outstanding shares of haynes holdings  inc common stock 
the plan of reorganization also provided for the payment or satisfaction of all secured and unsecured claims against haynes  except as reinstated under the plan of reorganization and except with respect to the senior notes due september   which were exchanged for equity as described above 
in the first quarter of fiscal  haynes acquired certain assets of the branford wire company the branford wire company acquisition  including a facility that manufactured both stainless steel wire and high performance alloy wire 
the company continues to produce stainless steel wire at the haynes wire company  in mountain home  north carolina 
on march   the company completed an equity offering  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of its common stock 
simultaneously the company listed its common stock on the nasdaq global market 
products the global specialty alloy market consists of three primary sectors stainless steel  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
the company believes that the high performance alloy sector represents less than of the total alloy market 
except for its stainless steel wire products  the company competes exclusively in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sectors  which includes hta products and cra products 
in fiscal  and  hta products accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues excluding stainless steel wire  respectively  and sales of the company s cra products accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues excluding stainless steel wire  respectively 
these percentages are based on data which include revenue associated with sales by the company to its foreign subsidiaries  but exclude revenue associated with sales by foreign subsidiaries to their customers 
management believes  however  that the effect of including revenue data associated with sales by its foreign subsidiaries would not materially change the percentages presented in this section 
high temperature resistant alloys 
hta products are used primarily in manufacturing components for the hot sections of gas turbine engines 
stringent safety and performance standards in the aerospace industry result in development lead times typically as long as eight to ten years in the introduction of new aerospace related market applications for hta products 
however  once a particular new alloy is shown to possess the properties required for a specific application in the aerospace market  it tends to remain in use for extended periods 
hta products are also used in gas turbine engines produced for use in applications such as naval and commercial vessels  electric power generators  power sources for offshore drilling platforms  gas pipeline booster stations and emergency standby power stations 
the following table sets forth information with respect to the company s significant high temperature resistant alloys  applications and features new hta development is discussed below under patents and trademarks alloy and year introduced end markets and applications features haynes hr alloy waste incineration cpi boiler tube shields good resistance to sulfidation at high temperatures haynes alloy aero seal rings high strength  low expansion and good fabricability haynes hr alloy lbgt cooling shrouds good strength to cost ratio as compared to competing alloys haynes alloy aero lbgt ducting  combustors good combination of strength  stability  oxidation resistance and fabricability haynes alloy aero honeycomb seals good combination of oxidation resistance and fabricating among nickel based alloys haynes alloy aero burner cans  after burner components high strength  oxidation resistant cobalt base alloys haynes alloy aero cpi ducting  tanks  vessels  weld overlays good fabricability and general corrosion resistance haynes alloy aero lbgt components for gas turbine hot gas exhaust pan good ductility and high strength at temperatures up to f haynes alloy aero ducting  vanes  nozzles weldable high strength alloy with good fabricability hastelloy x alloy aero lbgt burner cans  transition ducts good high temperature strength at relatively low cost haynes ti a alloy aero aircraft hydraulic and fuel systems components light weight  high strength titanium based alloy haynes alloy aero gas turbine parts  bearings  and various industrial applications excellent strength  good oxidation  resistance to f aero refers to the aerospace industry  lbgt refers to the land based gas turbines industry  cpi refers to the chemical processing industry 
represents a patented product or a product which the company believes has limited or no significant competition 
corrosion resistant alloys 
cra products are used in a variety of applications  such as chemical processing  power plant emissions control  hazardous waste treatment  sour gas production and pharmaceutical vessels 
historically  the chemical processing market has represented the largest end user sector for cra products 
due to maintenance  safety and environmental considerations  the company believes this market continues to represent an area of potential long term growth 
unlike aerospace applications within the hta product market  the development of new market applications for cra products generally does not require long lead times 
the following table sets forth information with respect to certain of the company s significant corrosion resistant alloys  applications and features new cra development is discussed below under patents and trademarks alloy and year introduced end markets and applications features hastelloy alloy c cpi tanks  mixers  piping versatile alloy with good resistance to uniform corrosion hastelloy alloy b cpi acetic acid plants better fabrication characteristics compared to other nickel molybdenum alloys hastelloy alloy d cpi plate heat exchangers corrosion resistance to hot sulfuric acid ultimet alloy cpi pumps  valves wear and corrosion resistant nickel based alloy hastelloy alloy g oil and gas sour gas tubulars good resistance to down hole corrosive environments hastelloy alloy c cpi fgd tanks  mixers  piping resistance to localized corrosion and pitting hastelloy alloy g cpi tanks  mixers  piping lower cost alloy with good corrosion resistance in phosphoric acid hastelloy alloy b cpi acetic acid resistance to hydrochloric acid and other reducing acids hastelloy alloy c cpi tanks  mixers  piping good thermal stability hastelloy alloy c cpi fgd oil land gas tanks  mixers  piping broad resistance to many environments cpi refers to the chemical processing industry  fgd refers to the flue gas desulphurization industry 
represents a patented product or a product to which the company believes has limited or no significant competition 
patents and trademarks the company currently maintains a total of approximately us patents and approximately foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at countries with significant or potential markets for the patented products and continues to develop  manufacture and test high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
since fiscal  the company s technical programs have yielded six new proprietary alloys  four of which are currently commercially available and two of which are being scaled up to be brought to market 
of the alloys which are being commercialized  two alloys saw advancement in the process during fiscal first  haynes alloy  which management believes will have significant commercial potential for the company in the long term  is the subject of a patent application filed in fiscal haynes alloy has excellent formability  fabricability and forgeability 
the commercial launch of haynes alloy occurred in october and  since that time  there have been approximately customer tests and evaluations of this product for the hot sections of gas turbines in the aerospace and land based gas turbine markets  as well as for automotive and other high temperature applications 
the company will continue to actively promote haynes alloy through customer engineering visits and technical presentations and papers 
in addition  commercialization of hastelloy c hs alloy also continued in fiscal the company has been providing customers with samples of this alloy and making technical presentations since testing and evaluation of the alloy is ongoing with special emphasis on applications for the oil and gas market 
it is important to note  however  that both of these alloys are in the early stages of commercialization and pounds sold to date are very low compared to the company s other proprietary alloys  furthermore  pounds in the next three to five years are expected to remain at low levels 
the company believes that the alloys particularly haynes alloy are significantly further along the commercialization curve when compared to historical trends for other proprietary alloys introduced by the company 
in addition to haynes alloy and hastelloy c hs alloy  commercialization is also ongoing for both hastelloy g and hastelloy hybrid bc alloy 
hastelloy g alloy  a cra with potential applications in the chemical processing and oil and gas industries  has significant strength after age hardening 
hastelloy hybrid bc alloy  a cra with potential applications in the chemical processing and oil and gas industries  has resistance to hydrochloric and sulfuric acid 
in addition to the commercialization of the above alloys  the company continues to scale up new alloys not yet ready to begin the commercialization process 
us patent applications were filed in fiscal for the haynes ns alloy and haynes hr alloy 
both of these new materials are believed to have significant  medium to long term commercial potential 
haynes ns alloy is a new alloy with extraordinary high temperature strength in sheet form  which has applications in the aerospace  land based gas turbine and automotive markets 
data generation and fabrication trials continued through  with test marketing expected to commence in early haynes hr alloy is an hta with superior resistance to oxidation 
patents or other proprietary rights are an important element of the company s business 
the company s strategy is to file patent applications in the us and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to the company 
in addition  the company seeks to protect its technology which is important to the development of the company s business 
the company also relies upon trade secret rights to protect its technologies and its development of new applications and alloys 
the company protects its trade secrets in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with its customers 
trademarks on the names of many of the company s alloys have also been applied for or granted in the us and certain foreign countries 
while the company believes its patents are important to its competitive position  significant barriers to entry continue to exist beyond the expiration of any patent period 
these barriers to entry and production include the unique equipment required to produce this material and the exacting process required to achieve the desired metallurgical properties 
these processing requirements include such items as specific annealing temperature  processing speeds and reduction per rolling pass 
management believes that the current alloy development program and these noted barriers to entry  reduce the impact of patent expirations on the company 
end markets the company estimates that the global specialty alloy market  including stainless steels  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys  represents total production volume of approximately billion pounds per annum 
of this total market  the company competes in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sector  which is estimated to represent approximately million pounds of production per annum 
the high performance alloy market demands diverse  specialty alloys suitable for use in precision manufacturing 
given the technologically advanced nature of the products  strict requirements of the end users and higher growth end markets  the company believes the high performance alloy sector provides greater growth potential  higher profit margins and greater means for service  product and price differentiation than stainless steels and general purpose nickel alloys 
while stainless steel and general purpose nickel alloy is generally sold in bulk through third party distributors  the company s products are sold in smaller sized orders which are customized and typically handled on a direct to customer basis 
aerospace 
the company has manufactured hta products for the aerospace market since the late s  and has developed numerous proprietary alloys for this market 
customers in the aerospace market tend to be the most demanding with respect to meeting specifications within very low tolerances and achieving new product performance standards 
stringent safety standards and continuous efforts to reduce equipment weight require close coordination between the company and its customers in the selection and development of hta products 
as a result  sales to aerospace customers tend to be made through the company s direct sales force 
demand for the company s products in the aerospace market is based on the new and replacement market for jet engines and the maintenance needs of operators of commercial and military aircraft 
the hot sections of jet engines are subjected to substantial wear and tear and accordingly require periodic maintenance  replacement and overhaul 
the company views the maintenance  replacement and overhaul business as an area of continuing growth 
chemical processing 
the chemical processing market represents a large base of customers with diverse cra applications driven by demand for key end use markets such as automobiles  housing  health care  agriculture  and metals production 
cra products supplied by the company have been used in the chemical processing market since the early s 
demand for the company s products in this market is driven by the level of maintenance  repair and expansion requirements of existing chemical processing facilities  as well as the construction of new facilities 
the company believes the extensive worldwide network of company owned service and sales centers  as well as its network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company s direct sales efforts in europe and asia  provide a competitive advantage in marketing its cra products in the chemical processing market 
land based gas turbines 
demand for the company s products in this market is driven by the construction of cogeneration facilities such as base load for electric utilities or as backup sources to fossil fuel fired utilities during times of peak demand 
demand for the company s alloys in the land based gas turbine markets has also been driven by concerns regarding lowering emissions from generating facilities powered by fossil fuels 
land based gas turbine generating facilities have gained acceptance as clean  low cost alternatives to fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
land based gas turbines are also used in power barges with mobility and as temporary base load generating units for countries that have numerous islands and a large coastline 
further demand is generated in mechanical drive units used for oil and gas production and pipeline transportation  as well as microturbines that are used as back up sources of power generation for hospitals and shopping malls 
in addition  with a service center in china and sales centers in india and singapore  the company is well positioned to take advantage of the long term growth potential in those areas in demand for power generation 
other markets 
other markets to which the company sells its hta products and cra products include flue gas desulphurization or fgd  oil and gas  waste incineration  industrial heat treating  automotive and instrumentation 
the fgd market has been driven by both legislated and self imposed standards for lowering emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
with the completion of the company s recent capital projects  the company anticipates increasing its participation in the fgd market due to the increased production capacity and the improved cost structure which resulted from the completion of the capital projects 
the company also sells its products for use in the oil and gas market  primarily in connection with sour gas production 
in addition  incineration of municipal  biological  industrial and hazardous waste products typically produces very corrosive conditions that demand high performance alloys 
markets capable of providing growth are being driven by increasing performance  reliability and service life requirements for products used in these markets which could provide further applications for the company s products 
as part of the branford wire company acquisition  the company also began selling stainless steel wire  but the company s strategy has been to reduce production of stainless steel wire and increase production of high performance alloy wire due to higher average selling price available on high performance alloy wire 
the company will continue to produce some amount of stainless steel wire  sold to higher value markets  such as the medical wire market 
sales and marketing and distribution the company sells its products primarily through its direct sales organization  which operates from total locations in the us  europe  asia and india  of which are service and sales centers 
all of the company s service and sales centers are operated either directly by the company or though its wholly owned subsidiaries 
approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal were generated by the company s direct sales organization 
the remaining of the company s fiscal net revenues was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company s direct sales in the us  europe and asia  some of whom have been associated with the company for over years 
going forward  the company expects its direct sales force to continue to generate approximately of its total sales  although this number may increase as new service and or sales centers are opened 
providing technical assistance to customers is an important part of the company s marketing strategy 
the company provides performance analyses of its products and those of its competitors for its customers 
these analyses enable the company to evaluate the performance of its products and to make recommendations as to the use of those products in appropriate applications  enabling the products to be included as part of the technical specifications used in the production of customers products 
the company s market development professionals are assisted by its engineering and technology staff in directing the sales force to new opportunities 
management believes the company s combination of direct sales  technical marketing  engineering and customer support provides an advantage over other manufacturers in the high performance alloy industry 
this activity allows the company to obtain direct insight into customers alloy needs and to develop proprietary alloys that provide solutions to customers problems 
the company continues to focus on growth in foreign markets 
in recent years  the company opened a service and sales center in china  the first service and sales center operated by any manufacturer of nickel and cobalt based alloys in china  and sales centers in singapore  india and italy 
for the long term  management continues to view china as an expanding market opportunity for the company  particularly in the event of continued strong gross domestic product growth 
sales from the company s us operations into china in fiscal were million  growing to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal part of this growth is attributable to the china service center which opened in fiscal  as well as the acquisition and consulting agreements in fiscal with hw limited as described in significant events of fiscal hw limited acquisition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained elsewhere in this form k 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate the possibility of opening a second service center in china  due in part to the continued long term growth in the chinese markets  although global economic conditions may delay this decision 
while the company is making concentrated efforts to expand foreign sales  the process of growing domestic business also continues 
the majority of revenue and profits continue to be provided by sales to us customers and the company continues to pursue opportunities to expand this market 
the company s domestic expansion effort includes  but is not limited to  continued expansion of ancillary product forms such as wire through the branford wire company acquisition  the continued development of new high performance alloys  the utilization of external conversion resources to expand and improve the quality of mill produced product  the addition of equipment in us service and sales centers to improve the company s ability to provide a product closer to the form required by the customer and the continued effort through the technical expertise of the company to find solutions to customer challenges 
the following table sets forth the approximate percentage of the company s fiscal net revenues generated through each of the company s distribution channels 
domestic foreign total company mill direct service and sales centers independent distributors sales agents total the company s top twenty customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
no customer or group of affiliated customers of the company accounted for more than of the company s net revenues in fiscal  or net revenues and net income in fiscal  and were generated primarily by the company s us operations 
sales to domestic customers comprised approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the majority of the company s operating costs are incurred in the us  as all of its manufacturing facilities are located in the us it is expected that net revenues and net income will continue to be highly dependent on the company s domestic sales and manufacturing facilities in the us the company s foreign and export sales were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
additional information concerning foreign operations and export sales is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
manufacturing process high performance alloys require a lengthier  more complex production process and are more difficult to manufacture than lower performance alloys  such as stainless steel alloys 
the alloying elements in high performance alloys must be highly refined during melting  and the manufacturing process must be tightly controlled to produce precise chemical properties 
the resulting alloyed material is more difficult to process because  by design  it is more resistant to deformation 
consequently  high performance alloys require that a greater force be applied when hot or cold working and are less susceptible to reduction or thinning when rolling or forging 
this results in more cycles of rolling  annealing and pickling compared to a lower performance alloy to achieve proper dimensions 
certain alloys may undergo as many as distinct stages of melting  remelting  annealing  forging  rolling and pickling before they achieve the specifications required by a customer 
the company manufactures its high performance alloys in various forms  including sheet  plate  billet ingot  tubular  wire and other forms 
the manufacturing process begins with raw materials being combined  melted and refined in a precise manner to produce the chemical composition specified for each high performance alloy 
for most high performance alloys  this molten material is cast into electrodes and additionally refined through electroslag remelting 
the resulting ingots are then forged or rolled to an intermediate shape and size depending upon the intended final product form 
intermediate shapes destined for flat products are then sent through a series of hot and cold rolling  annealing and pickling operations before being cut to final size 
the argon oxygen decarburization gas controls in the company s primary melt facility remove carbon and other undesirable elements  thereby allowing more tightly controlled chemistries  which in turn produce more consistent properties in the high performance alloys 
the argon oxygen decarburization gas control system also allows for statistical process control monitoring in real time to improve product quality 
the company has a four high steckel rolling mill for use in hot rolling material 
the four high steckel mill was installed in and is one of only two such mills in the high performance alloy industry 
the mill is capable of generating approximately million pounds of separating force and rolling a plate up to inches wide 
the mill includes integrated computer controls with automatic gauge control and programmed rolling schedules  two coiling steckel furnaces and five heating furnaces 
computer controlled rolling schedules for each of the hundreds of combinations of product shapes and sizes the company produces allow the mill to roll numerous widths and gauges to exact specifications without stoppages or changeovers 
the company also operates a three high rolling mill and a two high rolling mill  each of which is capable of custom processing much smaller quantities of material than the four high steckel mill 
these mills provide the company with significant flexibility in running smaller batches of varied products in response to customer requirements 
the company believes the flexibility provided by the three high and two high mills provides the company an advantage over its major competitors in obtaining smaller specialty orders 
investments in plant and equipment will allow the company to increase capacity  reduce unplanned equipment outages  produce higher quality products at reduced costs and improve working capital management 
the company spent million in fiscal and million in fiscal on plant and equipment upgrades 
the significant investments over the last several years are a result of under investment in prior years  as well as increases in customer demand 
the principal benefits of these investments are increased capacity  improved machine reliability  improved product quality  increased processing efficiency and reduced maintenance costs 
the improved reliability will help reduce the risk of unplanned outages similar to those that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal depending upon economic conditions  the company may make further equipment upgrades in fiscal  however  capital projects in fiscal will be focused on improving and maintaining the equipment reliability and will not likely equal the amount spent in either fiscal or fiscal at this time  management does not anticipate prolonged planned equipment outages as a result of upgrades in fiscal backlog the company defines backlog to include firm commitments from customers for delivery of product at established prices 
approximately of the orders in the backlog at any given time include prices that are subject to adjustment based on changes in raw material costs 
historically  approximately of the company s backlog orders have shipped within six months and approximately have shipped within months 
the backlog figures do not reflect that portion of the company s business conducted at its service and sales centers on a spot or just in time basis 
consolidated backlog at fiscal quarter end in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter raw materials in fiscal  nickel  a major component of many of the company s products  accounted for approximately of raw material costs  or approximately of total cost of sales 
each pound of high performance alloy contain  on average  nickel 
other raw materials include cobalt  chromium  molybdenum and tungsten 
melt materials consist of virgin raw material  purchased scrap and internally produced scrap 
the average nickel price per pound for cash buyers for the day period ended on the last day of the period presented  as reported by the london metals exchange for september   and  was  and  respectively 
while the price of nickel was lower for fiscal than fiscal  the lower price of nickel was offset by increased prices for other raw materials that are significant in the manufacture of the company s products such as molybdenum  cobalt and chromium 
since most of the company s products are produced pursuant to specific orders  the company purchases materials against known production schedules 
the materials are purchased from several different suppliers through various arrangements including annual contracts and spot purchases  and involve a variety of pricing mechanisms 
because the company maintains a policy of pricing its products at the time of order placement  the company attempts to establish selling prices with reference to known costs of materials  thereby reducing the risk associated with changes in the cost of raw materials 
however  to the extent that the price of nickel fluctuates rapidly  there may be an unfavorable effect on the company s gross profit margins 
the company periodically purchases material forward with certain suppliers 
research and technical support the company s technology facilities are located at the kokomo headquarters and consist of  square feet of offices and laboratories  as well as an additional  square feet of paved storage area 
the company has seven fully equipped technology testing laboratories  including a mechanical test lab  a metallographic lab  an electron microscopy lab  a corrosion lab  a high temperature lab and a welding lab 
these facilities also contain a reduced scale  fully equipped melt shop and process lab 
as of september   the technology  engineering and technological testing staff consisted of persons  of whom have engineering or science degrees  including with doctoral degrees  with the majority of degrees in the field of metallurgical engineering 
research and technical support costs primarily relate to efforts to develop new proprietary alloys and in the development of new applications for already existing alloys 
the company spent approximately million  million and million for research and technical support activities for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  research and development projects were focused on new alloy development  new product form development and new alloy concept validation  all relating to products for the aerospace  land based gas turbine  chemical processing and oil and gas industries 
in addition  significant projects were conducted to generate technical data in support of major market application opportunities in areas such as solid oxide fuel cells  biotechnology including waste incineration of toxic properties and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals  chemical processing and power generation 
competition the high performance alloy market is a highly competitive market in which eight to ten producers participate in various product forms 
the company s primary competitors include special metals corporation  which is now a part of precision cast parts  allegheny technologies  inc and krupp vdm gmbh  a subsidiary of thyssen krupp stainless 
the company faces strong competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of both high performance alloys similar to those the company produces and other competing metals 
the company may face additional competition in the future to the extent new materials are developed  such as plastics or ceramics that may be substituted for the company s products 
the company also believes that it will face increased competition from non us entities in the next five to ten years  especially from competitors located in eastern europe and asia 
additionally  in recent years the company has benefited from a weak us dollar  which makes the goods of foreign competitors more expensive to import into the us in the event that the us dollar strengthens  the company may face increased competition in the us from foreign competitors 
starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company experienced increased competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys 
due to a continued slowness in the stainless steel market  management believes these competitors increased their production levels and sales activity in high performance alloys to keep capacity in their mills as full as possible  while offering very competitive prices and delivery times 
as a result of this competition  the company s ability to raise prices on certain products has been limited  and in some cases prices were lowered  in the six most recent fiscal quarters 
historically  the company experienced similar price competition in the s and in the early s  when demand in the stainless market weakened 
employees as of september   the company employed approximately  full time employees worldwide 
all eligible hourly employees at the kokomo plant and the lebanon  indiana service and sales center approximately in the aggregate are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
in july  the company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers of america  which will expire in june management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory 
none of the employees of the company s arcadia  louisiana  mountain home  north carolina  european or asian operations are represented by a labor union 
environmental matters the company s facilities and operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
violations of these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and can require facilities improvements 
in addition  the company may be required in the future to comply with additional regulations pertaining to the emission of hazardous air pollutants under the clean air act 
however  since these regulations have not been proposed or promulgated  the company cannot predict the cost  if any  associated with compliance with such regulations 
expenses related to environmental compliance were approximately million for fiscal and are expected to be approximately million for fiscal although there can be no assurance  based upon current information available to the company  the company does not expect that costs of environmental contingencies  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities  who from time to time have issued findings of violations of governing laws  regulations and permits 
in the past five years  the company has paid administrative fines  none of which has had a material effect on the company s financial condition  for alleged violations relating to environmental matters  including the handling and storage of hazardous wastes  requirements relating to its title v air permit  requirements relating to the handling of polychlorinated biphenyls and violations of record keeping and notification requirements relating to industrial waste water discharge 
capital expenditures of approximately million were made for pollution control improvements during fiscal  with additional expenditures of approximately million for similar improvements planned for fiscal the company has received permits from the indiana department of environmental management  or idem  to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas at the kokomo facility previously used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the south landfill at the kokomo facility and post closure monitoring and care is ongoing there 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the north landfill at the kokomo facility and post closure monitoring and care are permitted and ongoing there 
in fiscal  idem issued a single post closure permit applicable to both the north and south landfills  which contains monitoring and post closure care requirements 
in addition  idem required that a resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  facility investigation  or rfi  be conducted in order to further evaluate one area of concern and one solid waste management unit 
the rfi commenced in fiscal and is ongoing 
the company has also received permits from the north carolina department of environment and natural resources  or ncdenr  to close and provide post closure monitoring and care for the hazardous waste lagoon at its mountain home  north carolina facility 
the lagoon area has been closed and is currently undergoing post closure monitoring and care 
the company is required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  the company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater and additional corrective action by the company could be required 
in addition  in august   employees discovered an abnormal ph in the sump pumps located in containment pits in the wastewater treatment facility 
after testing  it was determined that there was a leak in the pipeline from the cleaning house to the wastewater treatment facility 
ncdenr was notified within hours of the verification of the leak 
to date  the state has not responded to this disclosure 
historical nitric acid spills were discovered at the arcadia  louisiana location in fiscal analytical results were received in march  and the site assessment was provided to the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq in may 
remediation of the spill  including the purchase of new equipment  was substantially complete in fiscal a preliminary assessment of the ldeq authorized the company s proposed remedial actions 
in august   ldeq submitted a second round of inquiries after an existing sump pump was removed 
the company is in the process or responding to ldeq s inquiries 
the company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites  if required 
accordingly  the company can not assure you that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current former sites would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
additionally  it is possible that the company could be required to undertake other corrective action commitments for any other solid waste management unit existing or determined to exist at its facilities 
as a condition of the post closure permits  the company must provide and maintain assurances to idem and ncdenr of the company s capability to satisfy closure and post closure groundwater monitoring requirements  including possible future corrective action as necessary 
the company provides these required assurances through a statutory financial assurance test as provided by indiana and north carolina law 
the company may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
the company s operations generate hazardous substances  and  while a large percentage of these substances are reclaimed or recycled  the company also accumulates hazardous substances at each of its facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or cercla  and state counterparts 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties 
the company may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at other sites potentially subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
thus  there can be no assurance that the company will not be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future or that the costs associated with those sites would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations of liquidity

risk factors risks related to our business our revenues may fluctuate widely based upon changes in demand for our customers products 
demand for our products is dependent upon and derived from the level of demand for the machinery  parts and equipment produced by our customers  which are principally manufacturers and fabricators of machinery  parts and equipment for highly specialized applications 
historically  certain of the markets in which we compete have experienced unpredictable  wide demand fluctuations 
because of the comparatively high level of fixed costs associated with our manufacturing processes  significant declines in those markets have had a disproportionately adverse impact on our operating results 
since we became an independent company in  we have  in several instances  experienced substantial year to year declines in net revenues  primarily as a result of decreases in demand in the industries to which our products are sold 
in   and  our net revenues  when compared to the immediately preceding year  declined by approximately   and  respectively 
we may experience similar fluctuations in our net revenues in the future 
additionally  demand is likely to continue to be subject to substantial year to year fluctuations as a consequence of industry cyclicality  as well as other factors  and such fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
worldwide economic conditions have recently deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed  or could worsen  in the foreseeable future 
these conditions may have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers products and  in turn  on demand for our products 
if these conditions persist or worsen  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
profitability in the high performance alloy industry is highly sensitive to changes in sales volumes 
the high performance alloy industry is characterized by high capital investment and high fixed costs 
the cost of raw materials is the primary variable cost in the manufacture of our high performance alloys and  in fiscal  represented approximately of our total cost of sales 
other manufacturing costs  such as labor  energy  maintenance and supplies  often thought of as variable  have a significant fixed element 
profitability is  therefore  very sensitive to changes in volume  and relatively small changes in volume can result in significant variations in earnings 
we are subject to risks associated with global economic and political uncertainties like other companies  we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers 
the global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the continuing credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have an impact on our business and our financial condition 
in addition to the impact that the global financial crisis has already had  we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve or continue to worsen 
for example  an extension of the credit crisis to other industries could adversely impact overall demand for our products  which could have a negative effect on our revenues 
in addition  we are subject to various domestic and international risks and uncertainties  including changing social conditions and uncertainties relating to the current and future political climate 
changes in governmental policies particularly those that would limit or reduce defense spending could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may reduce our customers demand for our products and or depress pricing of those products used in the defense industry or which have other military applications  resulting in a material adverse impact on our business  prospects  results of operations  revenues and cash flows 
furthermore  any actual armed hostilities  and any future terrorist attacks in the us or abroad  could also have an adverse impact on the us economy  global financial markets and our business 
the effects may include  among other things  a decrease in demand in the aerospace industry due to reduced air travel  as well as reduced demand in the other industries we serve 
depending upon the severity  scope and duration of these effects  the impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be material 
risks associated with the commercial aerospace industry a significant portion of the sales of our high performance alloys represent products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace industry 
the aerospace industry has historically been cyclical due to factors both external and internal to the airline industry 
these factors include general economic conditions  airline profitability  consumer demand for air travel  varying fuel and labor costs  price competition  and international and domestic political conditions such as military conflict and the threat of terrorism 
the length and degree of cyclical fluctuation are influenced by these factors and therefore are difficult to predict with certainty 
demand for our products in this segment is subject to these cyclical trends 
a downturn in the commercial aerospace industry would adversely affect the prices at which we are able to sell these and other products  and our results of operations  business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can also result in rescheduling or cancellation of orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indication of near term business activity  but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
for example  the boeing company experienced a labor strike which was resolved in october that has prevented it from building new aircraft  and has experienced delays in the introduction of its new aircraft 
these events have created uncertainty in the aerospace supply chain generally and  if they persist for a significant length of time  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operations are dependent on production levels at our kokomo facility 
our principal assets are located at our primary integrated production facility in kokomo  indiana and at our production facilities in arcadia  louisiana and in mountain home  north carolina 
the arcadia and mountain home plants rely to a significant extent upon feedstock produced at the kokomo facility 
any production failures  shutdowns or other significant problems at the kokomo facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that we maintain adequate property damage insurance to provide for reconstruction of damaged equipment  as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production shutdown caused by an insured loss  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover such losses which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
although capital upgrades will allow us to produce more than million pounds of high performance alloys annually  our ability to increase net revenues and profitability depends upon our success in effectively utilizing this new capacity 
we have announced that our capital upgrade program will allow us to increase sheet production capacity from million pounds annually to million pounds annually  increasing total high performance alloy production capacity to more than million pounds 
our ability to utilize this capacity depends greatly upon continuing demand in our end markets  successfully increasing our market share and continued acceptance of our new products into the marketplace 
any failure to effectively utilize the increased capacity may negatively impact our ability to increase net revenues  profitability and net income 
during periods of lower demand in other alloy markets  some of our competitors may use their available capacity to produce higher volumes of high performance alloys  which leads to increased competition in the high performance alloy market 
in addition to high performance alloys  our primary competitors also produce and sell a broad range of other alloys  including stainless steel and titanium  while we produce primarily high performance alloys 
there are significant elements of fixed costs in the operating structure of these competitors  which can only be absorbed by keeping production levels high 
for that reason  if our competitors are unable to fill their production capacity with their core alloys such as stainless steel and titanium  they are likely to increase their production of high performance alloys 
these higher production levels will lead to increased competition  such as we are experiencing now  in the high performance alloy market  creating downward pricing pressures as a result of increased product in the market and more aggressive lead times and could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations 
rapid increases in the price of nickel may materially adversely affect our operating results 
to the extent that the price of nickel or other raw materials rises rapidly  there may be a negative effect on our gross profit margins 
in fiscal  nickel  a major component of many of our products  accounted for approximately of our raw material costs  or approximately of our total costs of sales 
we enter into several different types of sales contracts with our customers  some of which allow us to pass on increases in nickel prices to our customers 
in other cases  we price our products at the time of order  which allows us to establish prices with reference to known costs of materials  but which does not allow us to offset an unexpected rise in the price of nickel 
we may not be able to successfully offset rapid increases in the price of nickel or other raw materials in the future 
in the event that raw material price increases occur that we are unable to pass on to our customers  our cash flows or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
increases in energy costs and raw material costs may have a negative impact on our performance and financial condition 
since fiscal and through fiscal  our aggregate raw material and energy costs have consistently risen 
nickel  cobalt and molybdenum  the primary raw materials used to manufacture our products  all have experienced significant fluctuations in price 
continued growth in china has contributed to increased demand for many of the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes  which has led to increased prices for these raw materials 
the company uses natural gas in the manufacturing process to reheat material for purposes of annealing and forming 
continuing increases in raw material and energy costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operation 
failure to successfully develop  commercialize  market and sell new applications and new products could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our proprietary alloys and metallurgical manufacturing expertise provide us with a competitive advantage over other high performance alloy producers 
our ability to maintain this competitive advantage depends on our ability to continue to offer products that have equal or better performance characteristics than competing products at competitive prices 
our future growth will depend  in part  on our ability to address the increasingly demanding needs of our customers by enhancing the properties of our existing alloys  by timely developing new applications for our existing products  and by timely developing  commercializing  marketing and selling new products 
if we are not successful in these efforts  we may experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  commercialization  marketing and selling of these products  or if our new products and product enhancements do not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance  our revenues  cash flows and results of operations could be negatively affected 
we may be adversely affected by environmental  health and safety laws  regulations  costs and other liabilities 
we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment  the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the health and safety of our employees 
under these laws and regulations  we may be held liable for all costs arising out of any release of hazardous substances on  under or from any of our current or former properties or any off site location to which we sent or arranged to be sent wastes for disposal or treatment  and such costs may be material 
we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other hazardous substances that may be attributable to our products or other environmental damage 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations require our facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification 
these laws  regulations and permits can require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment 
violations of these laws  regulations or permits can also result in the imposition of substantial penalties  permit revocations and or facility shutdowns 
we have received permits from the environmental regulatory authorities in indiana and north carolina to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas of our kokomo and mountain home facilities that were used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
we are required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  we are aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater and additional corrective action could be required 
additionally  it is possible that we could be required to undertake other corrective action commitments for any other solid waste management unit existing or determined to exist at our facilities 
we are unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at either site  if required 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that the costs of future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
our operations generate hazardous substances  many of which we accumulate at our facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site or recycling by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to liability under cercla and state counterparts 
in addition  we may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at sites which are subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault 
we cannot assure you that we will not be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future or that the costs associated with current or future additional sites would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with environmental laws  we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental  health and safety laws  and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business environmental matters 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 
our estimates of liabilities and expenses for pension benefits incorporates significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  retirement age and mortality 
our results of operations  liquidity  or stockholders equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets  the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  or a reduction in the market value of plan assets 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel  our ability to effectively manage and expand our business will be harmed 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees who may terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any of our senior management team could harm our business 
the announcement of the loss of one of our key employees could negatively affect our stock price 
our ability to retain our skilled workforce and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future 
we face challenges in hiring  training  managing and retaining employees in certain areas including metallurgical researchers  equipment technicians  and sales and marketing staff 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled employees  our new product and alloy development and commercialization could be delayed  and our marketing and sales efforts could be hindered  which would adversely impact our competitiveness and financial results 
the risks inherent in our international operations may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from operations in international markets 
as we continue to expand internationally  we will need to hire  train and retain qualified personnel for our direct sales efforts and retain distributors and train their personnel in countries where language  cultural or regulatory impediments may exist 
we cannot ensure that distributors  regulators or other government agencies will continue to accept our products  services and business practices 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on the international market 
the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders  as well as the purchase of raw materials from international sources  subject us to the different trade regulations  including the foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  and other laws 
compliance with such regulations is costly 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities 
failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping  sales and service activities 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions  including our ability to obtain  and the costs associated with obtaining  us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in duties and tariffs  taxes  trade restrictions  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  burdens of complying with the fcpa and a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  business practices or laws favoring local companies  fluctuations in foreign currencies  restrictive trade policies of foreign governments  longer payment cycles and difficulties collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  difficulties in enforcing or defending agreements and intellectual property rights  and foreign political or economic conditions 
we cannot ensure you that one or more of these factors will not harm our business 
any material decrease in our international revenues or inability to expand our international operations would adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
although a collective bargaining agreement is in place for certain employees  union or labor disputes could still disrupt the manufacturing process 
all eligible hourly employees at the kokomo plant and the lebanon  indiana service and sales center approximately in the aggregate as of september  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
in fiscal  the collective bargaining agreement was extended until june even though a collective bargaining agreement is in place  it is still possible that union or labor disputes could disrupt our manufacturing process 
we intend to renegotiate the collective bargaining agreement in fiscal prior to the expiration of the agreement currently in place 
management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory 
we cannot assure you  however  that the renegotiation of the collective bargaining agreement in will not lead to a labor stoppage and negative effect on earnings 
risks related to shares of our common stock our stock price is subject to fluctuations as a result of being traded on a public exchange which may not be related to our performance 
the stock market in general has been highly volatile 
as a result  the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed elsewhere in this risk factors section and others such as our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies and companies deemed to be similar  fluctuations in the market price of nickel  raw materials or energy  market conditions in the end markets into which our customers sell their products  principally aerospace  power generation and chemical processing  announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  announcements by us of acquisitions  alliances  joint development efforts or corporate partnerships in the high temperature resistant alloy and corrosion resistant alloy markets  market conditions in the technology  manufacturing or other growth sectors  and rumors relating to us or our competitors 
you may not receive a return on investment through dividend payments nor upon the sale of your shares of our common stock 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends to our stockholders in the near term 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  financial conditions  projected liquidity  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
you also may not realize a return on your investment upon selling your shares of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as delaware statutes  may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
these provisions  including those regulating the nomination of directors  may make it more difficult for other persons  without the approval of our board of directors  to launch takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

service and sales centers 
the service and sales centers contain equipment capable of precision laser and water jet processing services to cut and shape products to customers precise specifications 
the company owns service and sales centers in the following locations openshaw  england stocks and sells all product forms  and lenzburg  switzerland stocks and sells all product forms 
the openshaw plant  located near manchester  england  consists of approximately acres of land and over  square feet of buildings on a single site 
the company closed the manufacturing portion of the openshaw plant in fiscal and is sourcing the required bar product for customers from external vendors 
this closure did not have a material effect on the overall revenue of the uk operation or overall operations or financial position 
in april  the company sold acres of the openshaw site for a profit of million  but retained ownership of the buildings 
it is anticipated that haynes will continue to own and operate the balance of the land  totaling acres  and the buildings

all owned and leased service and sales centers not described in detail above are single site locations and are less than  square feet 
the company believes that its existing facilities are suitable for its current business needs 
item legal proceedings the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
future developments and increasingly stringent regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures for these matters 
the company is regularly involved in litigation  both as a plaintiff and as a defendant  relating to its business and operations 
such litigation includes federal and state eeoc administrative actions and litigation and administrative actions relating to environmental matters 
for more information see item business environmental matters 
litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  and the level of future expenditures for legal matters cannot be determined with any degree of certainty 
nonetheless  based on the facts presently known  management does not believe that expenditures for legal proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company is currently  and has in the past  been subject to claims involving personal injuries allegedly relating to its products 
for example  the company is presently involved in two actions involving welding rod related injuries  both of which were filed in california state court against numerous manufacturers  including the company  in may and february  respectively  alleging that the welding related products of the defendant manufacturers harmed the users of such products through the inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese 
the company believes that it has defenses to these allegations and  that if the company were found liable  the cases would not have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition to these cases  the company has in the past been named a defendant in several other lawsuits  including filed in the state of california  alleging that its welding related products harmed the users of such products through the inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese 
the company has since been voluntarily dismissed from all of these lawsuits on the basis of the release and discharge of claims contained in the confirmation order issued in connection with the company s emergence from chapter reorganization 
while the company contests such lawsuits vigorously  and may have applicable insurance  there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect its liability for claims relating to exposure to welding fumes and manganese 
for instance  in recent cases  at least two courts in cases not involving haynes have refused to dismiss claims relating to inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese based upon a bankruptcy discharge order 
although the company believes the facts of these cases are distinguishable from the facts of its cases  it cannot assure you that any or all claims against the company will be dismissed based upon the confirmation order  particularly claims premised  in part or in full  upon actual or alleged exposure on or after the date of the confirmation order 
it is also possible that the company will be named in additional suits alleging welding rod injuries 
should such litigation occur  it is possible that the aggregate claims for damages  if the company is found liable  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

overview of business the global alloy market consists of three primary sectors stainless steel  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
except for its stainless steel wire products  the company competes exclusively in the high performance alloy sector  which includes high temperature resistant alloys  or hta  and corrosion resistant alloys  or cra 
hta and cra products accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and and  respectively  of the company s net revenues in fiscal in each case excluding stainless steel wire 
based on available industry data  the company believes that it is one of four principal producers of high performance alloys in flat product form  which includes sheet  coil and plate forms 
flat products accounted for of shipment pounds and of net revenues in fiscal  and of shipment pounds and of net revenues in fiscal the company also produces its alloys as seamless and welded tubulars  and in bar  billet and wire forms 
on a historical basis  flat products have accounted for a majority of the company s net revenues  and are anticipated to continue to do so on a prospective basis 
the company s direct sales organization  which consists of company operated service and or sales centers in the us  europe  asia and india  generated approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the remaining  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company s direct sales efforts in all markets 
going forward  the company expects its direct sales force to continue to generate approximately of it s of total sales  although this number may increase as new service and sales centers are opened 
net revenues and net income in fiscal and fiscal were generated primarily by the company s us operations 
sales to domestic customers comprised approximately of net revenues in fiscal and in fiscal in addition  the majority of the company s operating costs are incurred in the us  as all of its manufacturing facilities are located in the us although the company expects international sales to increase as it pursues its business strategy  for the foreseeable future  net revenues and net income will continue to be highly dependent on domestic sales and manufacturing facilities in the us sales to customers outside the us represented approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal and in fiscal it is anticipated that sales to customers outside of the us will continue to grow with the addition of foreign service and sales centers 
although no data is available  management believes a portion of the material that is sold to us distributors and fabricators is resold and shipped overseas 
the high performance alloy industry is characterized by high capital investment and high fixed costs 
profitability is  therefore  very sensitive to changes in volume  and relatively small changes in volume can result in significant variations in earnings 
the cost of raw materials is the primary variable cost in the manufacture of high performance alloys and represents approximately in fiscal of the company s total cost of sales 
other manufacturing costs  such as labor  energy  maintenance and supplies  often thought of as variable  have a significant fixed element within a certain relevant range of production 
lead times from order to shipment can be a competitive factor  as well as an indication of the strength of the demand for high performance alloys 
the company s current average lead times from order to shipment for mill produced products  depending on product form  can be as short as weeks and as long as weeks 
an order from a service and sales center can be filled in less than one week  depending upon the availability of materials in stock 
significant events of fiscal ceo transition the company announced on april  that francis petro had informed the board of his intention to retire as the company s president and chief executive officer at the end of his existing employment agreement on september  and to continue to serve as a member of the board of directors 
on september   the company announced that mark comerford was appointed as the new president and chief executive officer of the company reporting directly to the board of directors 
mr 
comerford assumed his new position effective upon mr 
petro s retirement from the company 
before joining the company  mr 
comerford was president of alloy products  the largest business unit within brush wellman inc since  mr 
comerford served in various positions for brush wellman inc both in the us and southeast asia 
in addition to his considerable experience at brush wellman inc  mr 
comerford also held positions at carpenter technology and american brass in various metallurgical engineering  international and commercial management positions 
gross profit margin beginning at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and continuing through the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a trend of increasing revenues and average selling price per pound  while gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined 
during the first quarter of fiscal  net revenue and average selling price per pound began to decline along with further erosion in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
compared to the first quarter of fiscal  net revenue increased in the second quarter  but average selling price per pound and gross profit as a percentage of net revenue continued to decline 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue from the first quarter to the second quarter of fiscal should be analyzed in light of the fact that the first quarter of fiscal included a one time benefit of million related to a pension curtailment gain 
adjusting for this gain  the gross profit as a percentage of net revenue improved in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter 
although gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal was lower than the same period in fiscal  it showed improvement over the first and second quarter of fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal was  which is lower than in same period of fiscal and also lower than the previous quarter of fiscal it was anticipated that gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal would be approximately  which would have been a slight improvement over the third quarter of fiscal and slightly below from the fourth quarter of fiscal one cause of the shortfall from forecast was reduced production volume of sheet product through the finishing operation as a result of issues associated with new annealing lines  including mechanical commissioning and the preparation of new standard operating procedures 
it is anticipated that this process will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal in addition to these operational challenges  pricing competition continued to increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal starting in the third quarter of fiscal  the company experienced increasing competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys 
due to continued slowness in the stainless steel market  management believes these competitors increased their production levels and sales activity in high performance alloys to keep capacity in their mills as full as possible  while offering very competitive prices and delivery times 
as a result of this competition  the company s ability to raise prices on certain products has been limited  and in some cases prices were lowered  in the six most recent fiscal quarters 
historically  the company experienced similar price competition in the s and in the early s  when demand in the stainless market weakened 
this competition should soften as the stainless market improves 
however  based on the current economic environment there is significant uncertainty as to when that may occur and the possibility exists that the stainless market may continue to deteriorate 
management believes  however  that the company continues to improve its ability to respond to the competition as a result of an increased emphasis on service centers  value added services and an improving cost structure which has resulted from the capital expenditure program 
it is anticipated that  with the completion of the upgrade to the second annealing line and improved processing capabilities  the company s delivery times and reliability will continue to improve 
hw limited acquisition on june  the company announced the expansion of its relationship with hw limited and its affiliated companies in hong kong and china for sales of haynes products throughout asia 
under the acquisition agreement and the related consulting agreement  which became effective on june  haynes sales and marketing presence in asia has been greatly expanded 
the sales force of hw limited s chinese affiliate was integrated into the haynes operations in china expanding haynes direct sales organization by eight people  which haynes believes will lead to a more effective organization 
in addition to overseeing this expanded organization  hw limited s principal  helen wang  will promote haynes products and services to customers in select markets in asia  including china  taiwan  south korea  singapore  thailand  laos  malaysia  vietnam  indonesia  cambodia  philippines  australia  and new zealand 
this consulting arrangement is one component of the company s continued campaign to grow its market presence in china and the rest of asia 
the asset acquisition and related agreements increased fixed assets million  increased non compete agreement by million and increased goodwill by million 
capital spending beginning in fiscal  the company began making significant investments in order to improve reliability and increase capacity in its sheet finishing operations 
upgrades to its cold rolling mill and one of two annealing lines were completed in fiscal equipment upgrades to the second annealing line were completed in the third quarter of fiscal  with commissioning starting in the fourth quarter 
due to the complexity of the commissioning process and development of new standard operating procedures  the commission process progressed at a slower pace than expected  and is anticipated to be complete in the first quarter of fiscal these upgrades to the sheet finishing operations have increased the production capacity for high performance alloys in sheet form from million pounds per year to million pounds per year 
the company s objective is to produce and sell at least million pounds of high performance alloys by no later than fiscal however  based on the current economic environment achieving that goal is uncertain 
management is in the process of evaluating the positive impact of the upgrades to sheet finishing capacity and other capital upgrades since fiscal on total high performance alloy capacity across all product forms 
management believes that the upgrades will allow the company to produce high performance alloy volumes in excess of the original estimate of million pounds which fits well with the long term growth potential of the company s markets 
in addition  management believes that the completion of these upgrades has had a positive impact on gross profit as a percentage of net revenue due to improved operating efficiency  reduced operating cost  improved quality and expanded product capability 
us pension plan change during the last two fiscal years  the company has taken action to reduce the funding requirements of its defined benefit pension plans 
new salaried employees hired after december  and new hourly employees hired after june  are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plans 
also  on october   the us pension plan was amended effective december  to freeze benefit accruals for all non union employees in the us and effective january   the pension multiplier used to calculate the employee s monthly benefit was increased from to 
in addition  the company will make enhanced matching contributions to its k plan equal to of the non union and union plan participant s salary deferrals  up to of compensation 
the company estimates the redesign of the pension plan  including previous actions to close the plan to new non union and union employees and the adjustment of the multiplier for non union and union plan participants will reduce funding requirements by million over the next six years 
the offsetting estimated incremental cost of the enhanced k match is million over the same six year period 
as a result of freezing the benefit accruals for all non union employees in the us in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a reduction of the projected benefit obligation of million  an increase to other comprehensive income before tax of million and a curtailment gain before tax of million 
the impact of the multiplier increase will be charged to pension expense over the estimated remaining lives of the participants

haynes emerged from bankruptcy on august  pursuant to a plan of reorganization 
the company s historical results from october  through august  the predecessor company are being presented along with the company s financial results from september  through september  the successor company 
as of august   the effective date of the plan of reorganization  the successor company began operating under a new capital structure and adopted fresh start reporting for its financial statements 
because of the company s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of fresh start reporting  the predecessor company s historical financial information for periods prior to august  is not comparable to the successor company s financial information for periods after august  the information was derived from combining the net revenue from haynes predecessor for the eleven months ended august  with net revenues from haynes successor for the one month ended september  fresh start adjustments had no impact on net revenues 
other revenue consists of toll conversion  royalty income  scrap sales and in fiscal and revenue recognized from the timet agreement 
during fiscal   and  the other markets category includes million  million  million and million in revenue  respectively  and million pounds  million pounds  million pounds and million pounds  respectively  of stainless steel wire as a result of the branford acquisition in november total product price per pound excludes other revenue 
demand in the company s markets remained strong in fiscal  with solid results in net revenues  volume and pricing in fiscal as compared to fiscal  in spite of increased levels of competition 
management believes that year to year improvement in net revenues was driven by several strategies intended to optimize returns and strengthen financial results 
for example  with demand solid and the company s capacity limited as a result of the company s capital upgrade program  the company focused on selling the highest volumes into the applications and markets that provided the highest average selling price 
in fiscal this strategy was particularly effective in the chemical processing and flue gas desulphurization industries 
in addition  the company continued to diversify its market base  expanding the industries served in the other markets category and also continuing to diversify geographically  focusing on its presence in china and the rest of asia 
this strategy resulted in the increase in export sales from of total sales in fiscal to of total sales in fiscal although revenue and volumes from quarter to quarter through both fiscal and tended to show strength  the backlog in the latter portion of fiscal began to exhibit signs of the weakening economic environment in specific market categories 
the backlog at the end of fiscal declined from the third quarter by approximately in both revenue dollars and pounds  while the average selling price remained essentially flat 
revenue dollars and volumes in the backlog were essentially flat between september  and september   while the average selling price declined approximately  in part as a result of a decline in the cost of nickel between periods 
revenue dollars and volume in the backlog at october  declined by from september   while average selling price remained essentially flat 
aerospace demand was robust in fiscal  as illustrated by the company s high level of sales in this market 
haynes is well positioned to continue meeting current levels of demand and the anticipated increased level of demand in the latter part of fiscal or early fiscal internal projects supporting this growth include the completion of upgrades to the company s cold rolling mill in fiscal and both annealing lines in fiscal which increased flat product finishing capacity by five million pounds  the installation of a new pilger mill at the arcadia facility  also in fiscal which increased capacity of seamless tubing  and continued expansion of the value added operations in the company s service centers 
although the order book for both boeing and airbus continues to be substantial  the push out of delivery schedules for the dreamliner and a are having an unfavorable effect on order entry and backlog 
although it is uncertain what the effect will be over the next six to twelve months  it is clear that aerospace revenues and pounds shipped will be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal the aerospace backlog dollars declined by approximately from the end of the third quarter of fiscal to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the aerospace backlog dollars through the end of october declined another from the end of september  even though the commercial oem portion of the business is likely to slow though at least the first and second quarters of fiscal  management believes the mro portion is likely to be less as affected because of the required maintenance schedules for engines currently in use 
pounds shipped in the land based gas turbine market in fiscal increased significantly from the previous year 
management believes  subject to global economic conditions  long term demand in the land based gas turbine market will continue to be solid  due to higher activity in power generation  oil and gas production  and alternative power systems application 
in addition  land based gas turbines are favored in electric generating facilities due to low capital cost at installation  flexibility in use of alternative fuels and fewer so emissions than the traditional fossil fuel fired facilities 
however  based on the current economic environment  it is anticipated that volumes for fiscal will be lower then fiscal although it is uncertain by how much 
the company s backlog for the land based gas turbine market declined by from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and declined another from september to october a portion of this decline is associated with the project business which historically does not recur evenly through the year 
sales to the chemical processing industry increased year over year  however  pounds shipped in the fourth quarter of fiscal were lower than the comparable quarter of the prior year and substantially lower than the third quarter of fiscal this is reflective of the sporadic project business  and the global economic downturn 
although there is some cyclicality as a result of project business expected in this market from quarter to quarter  historically the chemical processing industry slows as a result of an overall economic slowdown as has been seen in recent quarters 
management believes the reduced backlog is the result of a temporary dip in project business  but also a longer term trend resulting from the economic environment 
backlog dollars declined by from the end of the third fiscal quarter of to the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of during the month of october   the backlog for the chemical processing industry declined by an additional 
the company also continues its efforts to expand volumes sold into the industries which make up the other markets category 
the industries in this category focus on upgrading overall quality  improving product performance through increased efficiency  prolonging product life  and lowering long term costs 
companies in these industries are looking to achieve these goals through the use of advanced materials which supports the increased use of high performance alloys in an expanding number of applications 
on a year to year basis  after reducing for pounds of stainless steel wire  volume was essentially flat 
management intends to continue to invest in growing smaller markets included in this category because of the significant long term opportunities 
the backlog level for the other markets was consistent through fiscal and increased by from the end of the third quarter of fiscal to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal although in october   other markets backlog dollars declined by 
the company s financial performance in fiscal and is reflective of the strength in the markets it serves 
however  as noted in the preceding narrative  the activity in these markets  as reflected in the decline of the backlog  reflects the caution being exhibited by the company s customers 
going into fiscal  the global financial crisis  overall economic weakness  the competitive environment and the cautious approach of the company s customers to restocking will make repeating the performance of fiscal and fiscal unlikely for net revenues and gross profit 
however  the company is well positioned financially to maintain profit levels during this slowdown and resume strong revenue and earnings growth once conditions improve 
note on wire product the high performance alloy wire produced at the company s wire facility is reflected within the appropriate category where the wire is sold 
for example  high performance alloy wire produced for use in the chemical processing market is reflected in that category 
the stainless steel wire is reflected in the other markets category and reduced the average selling price per pound within that category on a comparative basis 
the company s strategy is to reduce production of stainless steel wire and increase production of high performance alloy wire due to higher average selling price obtained from high performance alloy wire 
the company will continue to produce some amount of stainless wire sold to higher value markets  such as the medical wire market 
during fiscal  this category included million of net revenue  which represented million pounds of stainless steel wire product  as compared to million of net revenue and million pounds of stainless steel wire product in fiscal impact of fresh start reporting on cost of sales upon implementation of the plan of reorganization  fresh start reporting was adopted by the company in accordance with sop under fresh start reporting  the reorganization value is allocated to the company s net assets based on their relative fair values in a manner similar to the accounting provisions applied to business combinations under statement of financial standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

the company s operating income was reduced by the recognition of the fair market value adjustments to the company s assets required by the adoption of fresh start reporting 
cost of sales included million  million  million  million and million of these costs in the one month period ended september  and the years ended september    and  respectively 
the fair market value adjustments to the historical basis of assets are being recognized as follows dollars in thousands fair value adjustment recognition period expense recognized from september to september  expense recognized from october  to september  expense recognized from october  to september  expense recognized from october  to september  expense recognized from october  to september  goodwill  n a inventory  months   machinery and equipment  years     buildings years land n a trademarks  n a patents  to years   under applicable accounting rules  goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are assessed to determine impairment at least annually

net revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal volume for all products increased by to million pounds in fiscal from million pounds in fiscal volume of high performance alloys increased by to million pounds in fiscal as compared to million pounds in fiscal volume of stainless steel wire decreased by to million pounds in fiscal as compared to million pounds in fiscal as a result of the company s strategy to reduce production of stainless steel wire and increase production of high performance alloy wire due to higher average selling price available on high performance alloy wire 
it is anticipated that there will continue to be a recurring amount of stainless steel wire produced and sold into certain specialty markets 
the aggregate average selling price per pound for all products increased by to per pound in fiscal from per pound in fiscal because of changes in product mix including market  form and alloy  an increased level of service center value added business  and changes in raw material prices 
although nickel prices were lower for fiscal than fiscal  the lower price of nickel was offset by increased prices for other raw materials that are significant in the manufacture of the company s products  such as molybdenum  cobalt and chromium 
increased competition unfavorably impacted both average selling price and volume 
the company s consolidated backlog decreased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  this was the result of the combination of a increase in pounds and a decrease in average selling price 
management believes completion of the expansion and upgrade of the company s sheet finishing operations should continue to help the company compete more effectively on lead time and cost  resulting in decreasing pricing pressure 
sales to the aerospace industry increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to a increase in the average selling price per pound combined with a increase in volume 
the increase in the average selling price per pound is due to improved product mix that includes a higher percentage of specialty alloy products which have a higher value and a generally higher average selling price when compared to the product mix sold in fiscal  and the effect of passing through higher raw material costs 
sales to the chemical processing industry increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to a increase in the average selling price per pound combined with a increase in volume 
the increase in the average selling price per pound is primarily due to the effect of passing through higher raw material costs and changes in product mix including form and alloy when compared to the product mix sold in fiscal volume in this market is affected by the project oriented nature of the market and economic activity 
sales to the land based gas turbine industry increased by to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  due to an increase of in the average selling price per pound combined with a increase in volume 
the increase in the average selling price per pound is due to improved market demand and changes in form and alloys compared to fiscal volume increased as a result of higher billet volume for fiscal compared to fiscal sales to other markets increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to a increase in average selling price per pound  which was partially offset by a decrease in volume 
the primary reason for the increase in average selling price per pound and the reduction in total volume was a decrease in the volume of stainless steel wire as a result of the company s strategy to reduce production of stainless steel wire and focus on the production and sale of high performance alloy wire 
stainless steel wire volume decreased by  while volume of high performance alloys sold to other markets decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal also contributing to the increase in average selling price is the change in product mix both form and alloy  market demand and passing through of higher raw material costs compared to fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in total sales volume of high performance alloys in the other markets category is due to a large fgd project which was included in fiscal and did not repeat this year 
other revenue 
other revenue increased by to million in fiscal from million for fiscal the increase is due to higher activity in toll conversion  revenue recognized from the twenty year agreement to provide conversion services to titanium metals corporation as described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  scrap sales and miscellaneous sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million  or of net revenues in fiscal compared to million  or of net revenues in fiscal cost of sales increased as a result of a combination of the following factors i increased volumes  ii increased manufacturing costs due to planned and unplanned equipment outages  iii changes in product mix due to an increase in the production and sale of higher cost alloy and forms  iv increased energy costs  and v increased raw material costs of molybdenum  cobalt and chromium partially offset by the lower nickel costs 
in fiscal cost of sales was increased due to a one time bonus accrual to union employees upon ratification of the collective bargaining agreement of million or of net revenue  which did not repeat in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by higher wage rates for union employees and increased fringe benefit costs in fiscal cost of sales in fiscal was also decreased by a million of net revenue pension curtailment gain  which was recorded due to an amendment to freeze future pension benefit accruals for non union employees in the us the overall increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues and the corresponding decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue can also be attributed to the increased competition which lowered net revenue as discussed above under overview 
while the price of nickel was lower for fiscal than fiscal  the lower price of nickel was offset by increased prices for other raw materials that are significant in the manufacture of the company s products  such as molybdenum  cobalt and chromium 
as reported by the london metals exchange  the average price per pound for day cash buyers of nickel at september  was compared to at september   and the average price over the course of fiscal was higher than the day cash average at september  selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to i higher business activity causing commissions and sales expenses to increase million  and ii the fiscal reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts of million compared to fiscal to reflect the write off history 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal due primarily to increased revenues 
research and technical expense 
research and technical expense slightly increased by million to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal due to normal inflationary increases and increased staff levels earlier in fiscal required to support the transition of retiring employees 
operating income 
as a result of the above factors  operating income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million in fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease is due to a lower average balance outstanding resulting from i the company s application of proceeds from the equity offering that occurred near the end of the second quarter of fiscal  ii cash generated from operations  and iii proceeds from the exercise of stock options which were used to reduce the outstanding debt balance

inflation historically  the company has had the ability to pass on to customers both increases in consumable costs and material costs because of the value added contribution the material makes to the final product 
material comprises the most significant portion of the product costs 
nickel  cobalt and molybdenum  the primary raw materials used to manufacture the company s products  all have experienced significant fluctuations in price 
until now the company has been able to pass the cost on to the customers  however  in the future the company may not be able to successfully offset rapid increases in the price of nickel or other raw material

critical accounting policies and estimates overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  asset impairments  retirement benefits  matters related to product liability lawsuits and environmental matters 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  pension asset mix and  in some cases  actuarial techniques  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this process form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company routinely reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
the following listing of policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when collectability is reasonably assured and when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment fob shipping point or at a foreign port for certain export customers 
allowances for sales returns are recorded as a component of net revenues in the periods in which the related sales are recognized 
management determines this allowance based on historical experience and the company has not had any history of returns that have exceeded its recorded allowances 
should returns increase above historical experience  additional allowances may be required 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has defined benefit pension and postretirement plans covering most of its current and former employees 
significant elements in determining the assets or liabilities and related income or expense for these plans are the expected return on plan assets if any  the discount rate used to value future payment streams  expected trends in health care costs  and other actuarial assumptions 
annually  the company evaluates the significant assumptions to be used to value its pension and postretirement plan assets and liabilities based on current market conditions and expectations of future costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be required in future periods 
the company believes the expected rate of return on plan assets of is a reasonable assumption on a long term perspective based on its asset allocation of equity  fixed income and other 
the company s assumption for expected rate of return for plan assets for equity  fixed income  and real estate other are  and  respectively 
this position is supported through a review of investment criteria  and consideration of historical returns over a several year period 
salaried employees hired after december  and hourly employees hired after june  are not covered by the pension plan  however  they are eligible for an enhanced matching program of the defined contribution plan k 
effective december   the us pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for all non union employees in the us impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
recoverability of goodwill is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the fair value 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the implied fair value exceeds its carrying amount 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value  if any  after allocating the fair value to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and all of the liabilities 
the fair value is generally determined using a combination of a market value approach using quoted market prices and an income approach using discounted cash flow projections 
changes in the market value and cash flow projections of the company could have significant impact on whether or not goodwill is impaired and the amount of the impairment 
assumptions and estimates with respect to estimated future cash flows used in the evaluation are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the company reviewed goodwill and trademarks for impairment as of august   and concluded no impairment adjustment was necessary 
however  as a result of a recent decline in the company s common stock price  goodwill will be evaluated on a quarterly basis for potential impairment if such conditions continue 
share based compensation the company has two stock option plans that authorize the granting of non qualified stock options to certain key employees and non employee directors for the purchase of a maximum of  shares of the company s common stock 
the original option plan was adopted in august pursuant to the plan of reorganization and provides the grant of options to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
in january  the company s board of directors adopted a second option plan that provides for options to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
each plan provides for the adjustment of the maximum number of shares for which options may be granted in the event of a stock split  extraordinary dividend or distribution or similar recapitalization event 
unless the compensation committee determines otherwise  options granted under the option plans are exercisable for a period of ten years for the date of grant and vest per year over three years from the grant date 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  a replacement of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and a rescission of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the statement requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements

additionally  under the modified prospective method of adoption  the company recognizes compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards on the adoption date for which the requisite service period has not yet been rendered based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based upon the grant date fair value 
the fair value of the option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions on dividend yield  risk free interest rate  expected volatilities  expected forfeiture rate  and expected lives of the options

 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is needed is based upon an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence and the expected reversal date of temporary differences to be deducted on future income tax returns 
in its evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  the company assesses prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and expected reversal dates 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be different from those recorded  as influenced by potential changes in enacted tax laws and the availability of future taxable income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and the price of nickel  which is a commodity 
changes in interest rates affect the company s interest expense on variable rate debt 
all of the company s outstanding debt was variable rate debt at september  and a hypothetical increase in the interest rate on variable rate debt would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  the company has not entered into any derivative instruments to hedge the effects of changes in interest rates 
the foreign currency exchange risk exists primarily because the foreign subsidiaries maintain receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currency or the us dollar

the us operations transact their foreign sales in us dollars  thereby avoiding fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
any exposure aggregating more than  requires approval from the company s vice president of finance 
the company is not currently party to any currency contracts 
fluctuations in the price of nickel  the company s most significant raw material  subject the company to commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to this market risk through internally established policies and procedures  including negotiating raw material escalators within product sales agreements  and continually monitoring and revising customer quote amounts to reflect the fluctuations in market prices for nickel 
the company does not use derivative instruments to manage this market risk 
the company monitors its underlying market risk exposure from a rapid change in nickel prices on an ongoing basis and believes that it can modify or adapt its strategies as necessary 
the company periodically purchases raw material forward with certain suppliers 
however  there is a risk that the company may not be able to successfully offset a rapid increase in the cost of raw material in the future as it has been able to in the past
