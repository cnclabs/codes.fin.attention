table of contents our operations include both conventional and unconventional developmental drilling opportunities  as well as some exploratory prospects 
in the cotton valley play in east texas  we drilled gross wells in and added a sixth drilling rig in the second half of we are shifting focus to infill drilling on acre spacing  which may increase proved reserves and production levels 
in appalachia  we drilled gross wells in  including gross horizontal coalbed methane locations 
in the selma chalk play in mississippi  we drilled gross wells in  including two successful horizontal wells 
we also have unconventional development programs in the mid continent and some higher impact exploratory prospects in the gulf coast 
pvr coal and natural resource management segment overview the pvr coal and natural resource management segment primarily involves the management and leasing of coal and natural resource properties and the subsequent collection of royalties 
pvr also earns revenues from the provision of fee based coal preparation and loading services  from the sale of standing timber on its properties  from oil and gas royalty interests it owns and from coal transportation  or wheelage  fees 
as of december   pvr owned or controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in central and northern appalachia  the san juan basin and the illinois basin 
as of december   approximately of pvr s proven and probable coal reserves were steam coal used primarily by electric generation utilities  and the remaining were metallurgical coal used primarily by steel manufacturers 
pvr enters into long term leases with experienced  third party mine operators  providing them the right to mine its coal reserves in exchange for royalty payments 
pvr actively works with its lessees to develop efficient methods to exploit its reserves and to maximize production from its properties 
pvr does not operate any mines 
in  pvr s lessees produced million tons of coal from its properties and paid pvr coal royalties revenues of million  for an average royalty per ton of 
approximately of pvr s coal royalties revenues in and of pvr s coal royalties revenues in were derived from coal mined on its properties under leases containing royalty rates based on the higher of a fixed base price or a percentage of the gross sales price 
the balance of pvr s coal royalties revenues for the respective periods was derived from coal mined on its properties under leases containing fixed royalty rates that escalate annually

pvr natural gas midstream segment overview the pvr natural gas midstream segment is engaged in providing gas processing  gathering and other related natural gas services 
pvr owns and operates natural gas midstream assets located in oklahoma and the panhandle of texas 
these assets include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and three natural gas processing facilities having mmcfd of total capacity 
pvr s natural gas midstream business derives revenues primarily from gas processing contracts with natural gas producers and from fees charged for gathering natural gas volumes and providing other related services 
pvr also owns a natural gas marketing business  which aggregates third party volumes and sells those volumes into intrastate pipeline systems and at market hubs accessed by various interstate pipelines 
pvr acquired its first natural gas midstream assets through the acquisition of cantera gas resources  llc  or cantera  in march in  system throughput volumes at pvr s gas processing plants and gathering systems  including gathering only volumes  were bcf  or approximately mmcfd 
in  one of pvr s natural gas midstream customers  conocophillips company  accounted for of pvr s natural gas midstream revenues and of our total consolidated revenues 
corporate and other corporate and other primarily represents corporate functions 
business strategy we intend to pursue the following business strategies 
table of contents continue to grow through the drillbit 
we anticipate spending million on development and exploratory drilling and related facilities in we currently plan to allocate million  or of this amount to development drilling activity in our core areas of the east texas  mid continent  appalachia and mississippi regions 
we intend to apply the remaining million  or  to our exploratory activities in the gulf coast  east texas  mid continent and appalachian regions 
in addition  we are applying horizontal drilling technology in many of our development and exploration plays  which may result in increased reserve additions and higher production rates 
where practical  we collaborate with established industry partners in many of our exploration activities to better manage costs and operational risks 
pursue selective acquisition opportunities in existing basins 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of properties that we believe have primarily development potential and that are consistent with our lower risk drilling strategies 
our experienced team of management and technical professionals consistently looks for new opportunities to increase reserves and production that complement our existing core properties 
for example  in we acquired  in two transactions  properties with a total of bcfe of management estimated proved reserves located in the cotton valley play in east texas for an aggregate purchase price of million  properties with bcfe of management estimated proved reserves in eastern oklahoma for million  and properties with bcfe of management estimated proved reserves for a purchase price of million in the selma chalk play in mississippi 
management estimates that these four acquisitions added a total of bcfe of proved reserves and approximately additional drilling locations to our inventory 
manage risk exposure through an active hedging program 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging the commodity price risk for our expected proved developed production through the use of derivatives  typically costless collars 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our cash flow at risk  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
as of december   we had hedged approximately and of proved developed production for and the first through third quarters of assist pvr in growing its sources of cash flow 
pvr s management continues to focus on acquisitions and investments that increase and diversify its sources of long term cash flow 
during  pvr acquired million tons of coal reserves in two acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  in  pvr acquired approximately  acres of forestland in west virginia for a purchase price of approximately million and royalty interests in certain oil and gas leases relating to properties located in kentucky and virginia for a purchase price of approximately million 
the gain on the sale of royalty interests to pvr was eliminated in the consolidation of our financial statements 
during  pvr also expended million on expansion projects to allow it to capitalize on opportunities to add new supplies of natural gas 
the expansion projects included two natural gas processing facilities with a combined mmcfd of inlet gas capacity  which are expected to commence operations in for a more detailed discussion of pvr s acquisitions  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions  dispositions and investments 
utilize the advantages of our relationship with pvr 
during  pvr began marketing our natural gas production in louisiana  oklahoma and texas  replacing a third party marketing company and allowing us to realize higher prices for our oil and natural gas sold in that region 
in  pvr announced plans to construct a new mmcfd gas processing plant in the bethany field in east texas and entered into a gas gathering and processing agreement with us 
the new east texas plant will provide fee based gas processing services to our oil and gas business  as well as other producers 
in addition  as discussed above  we sold approximately million of oil and gas royalty interests to pvr  allowing us to profitably dispose of non core assets 
the gain on the sale of royalty interests to pvr was eliminated in the consolidation of our financial statements 
we will continue to look for ways to take advantage of our relationship with pvr in mutually beneficial ways 
contracts oil and gas segment transportation 
the majority of our natural gas production is transported to market on three major pipeline or transmission systems 
nisource inc  crosstex energy services lp and duke energy corporation transported approximately  and of our natural gas production 
the remainder of our natural gas production was transported by several pipeline companies in louisiana  texas and west virginia 
in almost all cases  our natural gas is sold at interconnects with transmission pipelines 
we have entered into contracts which provide firm transportation capacity rights for specified volumes per day on a pipeline system for terms ranging from one to years 
the contracts require us to pay transportation demand charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity we use 
we may sell excess capacity to third parties at our discretion 

table of contents marketing 
we generally sell our natural gas using spot market and short term fixed price physical contracts 
for the year ended december   two of our oil and gas customers  crosstex gulfcoast marketing and duke energy corporation  accounted for approximately and of our natural gas and oil and condensate revenues and and of our total consolidated revenues 
pvr coal and natural resource management segment pvr earns most of its coal royalties revenues under long term leases that generally require its lessees to make royalty payments to it based on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal they sell 
the balance of pvr s coal royalties revenues are earned under long term leases that require the lessees to make royalty payments to pvr based on fixed royalty rates which escalate annually 
a typical lease either expires upon exhaustion of the leased reserves or has a five to ten year base term  with the lessee having an option to extend the lease for at least five years after the expiration of the base term 
substantially all of pvr s leases require the lessee to pay minimum rental payments to pvr in monthly or annual installments  even if no mining activities are ongoing 
these minimum rentals are recoupable  usually over a period from one to three years from the time of payment  against the production royalties owed to pvr once coal production commences 
substantially all of pvr s leases impose obligations on the lessees to diligently mine the leased coal using modern mining techniques  indemnify pvr for any damages it incurs in connection with the lessee s mining operations  including any damages pvr may incur due to the lessee s failure to fulfill reclamation or other environmental obligations  conduct mining operations in compliance with all applicable laws  obtain its written consent prior to assigning the lease and maintain commercially reasonable amounts of general liability and other insurance 
substantially all of the leases grant pvr the right to review all lessee mining plans and maps  enter the leased premises to examine mine workings and conduct audits of lessees compliance with lease terms 
in the event of a default by a lessee  substantially all of the leases give pvr the right to terminate the lease and take possession of the leased premises 
in addition  pvr earns revenues under coal services contracts  timber contracts and oil and gas leases 
pvr s coal services contracts generally provide that the users of pvr s coal services pay pvr a fixed fee per ton of coal processed at its facilities 
all of pvr s coal services contracts are with lessees of pvr s coal reserves and these contracts generally have terms that run concurrently with the related coal lease 
pvr s timber contracts generally provide that the timber companies pay us a fixed price per thousand board feet of timber harvested from our property 
pvr receives royalties under its oil and gas leases based on a percentage of the revenues the producers receive for the oil and gas they sell 
pvr natural gas midstream segment pvr s natural gas midstream business generates revenues primarily from gas purchase and processing contracts with natural gas producers and from fees charged for gathering natural gas volumes and providing other related services 
during the year ended december   pvr s natural gas midstream business generated a majority of its gross margin from two types of contractual arrangements under which its margin is exposed to increases and decreases in the price of natural gas and ngls i percentage of proceeds and ii keep whole arrangements 
as of december   approximately of pvr s system throughput volumes were processed under gas purchase keep whole contracts  were processed under percentage of proceeds contracts  and were processed under fee based gathering contracts 
a majority of the gas purchase keep whole and percentage of proceeds contracts include fee based components such as gathering and compression charges 
there is also a processing fee floor included in many of the gas purchase keep whole contracts that ensures a minimum processing margin should the actual margins fall below the floor 
gas purchase keep whole arrangements 
under these arrangements  pvr generally purchases natural gas at the wellhead at either i a percentage discount to a specified index price  ii a specified index price less a fixed amount or iii a combination of i and ii 
pvr then gathers the natural gas to one of its plants where it is processed to extract the entrained ngls  which are then sold to third parties at market prices 
pvr resells the remaining natural gas to third parties at an index price which typically corresponds to the specified purchase index 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas during processing reduces the btu content of the natural gas  pvr retains a reduced volume of gas to sell after processing 
accordingly  under these arrangements  pvr s revenues and gross margins increase as the price of ngls increases relative to the price of natural gas  and its revenues and gross margins decrease as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
pvr has generally been able to mitigate its exposure in the latter case by requiring the payment under many of its gas purchase keep whole arrangements of minimum processing charges which ensure that pvr receives a minimum amount of processing revenues 
the gross margins that pvr realizes under the arrangements described in clauses i and iii above also decrease in periods of low natural gas prices because these gross margins are based on a percentage of the index price 

table of contents percentage of proceeds arrangements 
under percentage of proceeds arrangements  pvr generally gathers and processes natural gas on behalf of producers  sells the resulting residue gas and ngl volumes at market prices and remits to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds of those sales based on either an index price or the price actually received for the gas and ngls 
under these types of arrangements  pvr s revenues and gross margins increase as natural gas prices and ngl prices increase  and its revenues and gross margins decrease as natural gas prices and ngl prices decrease 
fee based arrangements 
under fee based arrangements  pvr receives fees for gathering  compressing and or processing natural gas 
the revenues pvr earns from these arrangements are directly dependent on the volume of natural gas that flows through its systems and are independent of commodity prices 
to the extent a sustained decline in commodity prices results in a decline in volumes  however  pvr s revenues from these arrangements would be reduced due to the related reduction in drilling and development of new supply 
in many cases  pvr provides services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above 
the terms of pvr s contracts vary based on gas quality conditions  the competitive environment at the time the contracts were signed and customer requirements 
the contract mix and  accordingly  exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of changes in producer preferences  expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors 
pvr is also engaged in natural gas marketing by aggregating third party volumes and selling those volumes into interstate and intrastate pipeline systems such as enogex and oneok and at market hubs accessed by various interstate pipelines 
connect energy services  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of pvr  earned fees for marketing a portion of penn virginia oil gas  lp s natural gas production during and penn virginia oil gas  lp is a wholly owned subsidiary of us 
the marketing agreement was effective september  revenues from this business do not generate qualifying income for a publicly traded limited partnership  but pvr does not expect it to have an impact on its tax status  as it does not represent a significant percentage of pvr s operating income 
for the years ended december  and  natural gas marketing activities generated million and million in net revenues 
commodity derivative contracts our oil and gas segment and the pvr natural gas midstream segment utilize costless collar  three way option and swap derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with forecasted oil and gas revenues and natural gas midstream revenues and cost of midstream gas purchased 
the pvr natural gas midstream segment also utilizes swap derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in its frac spread 
pvr s frac spread is the spread between the purchase price for the natural gas pvr purchases from producers and the sale price for the ngls that pvr sells after processing 
pvr hedges against the variability in its frac spread by entering into swap derivative contracts to sell ngls forward at a predetermined swap price and to purchase an equivalent volume of natural gas forward on an mmbtu basis 
while the use of derivative instruments limits the risk of adverse price movements  their use also may limit future revenues or cost savings from favorable price movements 
with respect to a costless collar contract  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such contract 
we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price for such contract 
neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price for such contract 
a three way option contract consists of a collar contract as described above plus a put option contract sold by us with a price below the floor price of the collar 
this additional put requires us to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the put option price 
by combining the collar contract with the additional put option  we are entitled to a net payment equal to the difference between the floor price of the collar contract and the additional put option price if the settlement price is equal to or less than the additional put option price 
if the settlement price is greater than the additional put option price  the result is the same as it would have been with a collar contract only 
this strategy enables us to increase the floor and the ceiling prices of the collar beyond the range of a traditional collar contract while defraying the associated cost with the sale of the additional put option 
with respect to a swap contract  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such contract  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such contract 

table of contents see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further description of our and pvr s derivatives programs 
corporate structure as of december   we owned the general partner of pvg and an approximately limited partner interest in pvg 
pvg owns the general partner of pvr  which holds a general partner interest in pvr and all the incentive distribution rights  and an approximately limited partner interest in pvr 
we directly owned an additional limited partner interest in pvr as of december  the following diagram depicts our ownership of pvg and pvr as of december  logo because we control the general partner of pvg  the financial results of pvg are included in our consolidated financial statements 
because pvg controls the general partner of pvr  the financial results of pvr are included in pvg s consolidated financial statements 
however  pvg and pvr function with capital structures that are independent of each other and us  with each having publicly traded common units and pvr having its own debt instruments 
pvg does not currently have any debt instruments 
while we report consolidated financial results of pvr s coal and natural resources management and natural gas midstream businesses  the only cash we receive from those businesses is in the form of cash distributions we receive from pvg and pvr in respect of our partner interests in each of them 
partnership distributions pvg cash distributions pvg paid cash distributions of per common unit during the year ended december  in the first quarter of  pvg paid a quarterly distribution of on an annualized basis per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of for the remainder of  pvg expects to pay quarterly distributions of at least on an annualized basis per common unit 
pvr cash distributions pvr paid cash distributions of per common and class b unit during the year ended december  in the first quarter of  pvr paid a quarterly distribution of on an annualized basis per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of for the remainder of  pvr expects to pay quarterly distributions of at least on an annualized basis per common unit 
pvr incentive distribution rights a wholly owned subsidiary of pvg is the general partner of pvr and  as such  holds certain incentive distribution rights which represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating 
table of contents surplus after pvr has paid minimum quarterly distributions and certain target distribution levels have been achieved 
the minimum quarterly distribution is per unit per unit on an annualized basis 
pvr s general partner currently holds of the incentive distribution rights  but may transfer these rights separately from its general partner interest to an affiliate other than an individual or to another entity as part of the merger or consolidation of the general partner with or into such entity or the transfer of all or substantially all of the general partner s assets to another entity without the prior approval of pvr s unitholders if the transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of pvr s partnership agreement 
prior to september   other transfers of incentive distribution rights will require the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of pvr s outstanding common units 
on or after september   the incentive distribution rights will be freely transferable 
pvg s ownership of pvr s incentive distribution rights entitles it to receive the following percentages of cash distributed by pvr as it reaches the following target cash distribution levels of all incremental cash distributed in a quarter after has been distributed in respect of each common unit of pvr for that quarter  of all incremental cash distributed after has been distributed in respect of each common unit of pvr for that quarter  and the maximum sharing level of of all incremental cash distributed after has been distributed in respect of each common unit of pvr for that quarter 
since  pvr has increased its quarterly cash distribution times from per unit on an annualized basis to per unit on an annualized basis  which is its most recently declared distribution 
these increased cash distributions by pvr have placed pvg at the third and maximum target cash distribution level as described above 
as a consequence  any increase in cash distributions from pvr will allow pvg to share at the level and the cash distributions pvg receives from pvr with respect to its indirect ownership of the incentive distribution rights will increase more rapidly than those with respect to its ownership of the general partner and limited partner interests 
because pvg is at the maximum target cash distribution level on the incentive distribution rights  future growth in distributions it receives from pvr will not result from an increase in the target cash distribution level associated with the incentive distribution rights 
cash distributions received prior to pvg s initial public offering  or the pvg ipo  in december  we indirectly owned common units representing an approximately limited partner interest in pvr  as well the sole general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in pvr 
in conjunction with the pvg ipo  we contributed our general partner interest  including our incentive distribution rights  and most of our limited partner interest in pvr to pvg in exchange for the general partner interest and a limited partner interest in pvg 
pvg also purchased additional common units and class b units of pvr with the proceeds of the pvg ipo 
we are currently entitled to receive quarterly cash distributions from pvg and pvr on our limited partner interests in pvg and pvr 
we have historically received increasing distributions from our partner interests in pvg and pvr 
as a result of our partner interests in pvg and pvr  we received total distributions from pvg and pvr in  and as shown in the following table year ended december  in thousands penn virginia gp holdings  lp penn virginia resource partners  lp total based on pvg s and pvr s current annualized distribution rates of and per unit  we would receive aggregate annualized distributions of million in respect of our partner interests

table of contents year ended december  in thousands limited partner units general partner interest incentive distribution rights total competition oil and gas segment the oil and natural gas industry is very competitive  and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that are large  well established and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may adversely affect our ability to compete or grow our business 
many such companies not only engage in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves  but also carry on refining operations  electricity generation and the marketing of refined products 
competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties and oil and gas reserves 
our competitive position depends on our geological  geophysical and engineering expertise  our financial resources  our ability to develop properties and our ability to select  acquire and develop proved reserves 
we compete with other oil and natural gas companies to secure drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for the drilling and completion of wells and recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  including geologists  geo physicists  engineers and other specialists 
such equipment and labor may be in short supply from time to time 
shortages of equipment  labor or materials may result in increased costs or the inability to obtain such resources as needed 
we also compete with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas  and the oil and natural gas industry in general competes with other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
pvr coal and natural resource management segment the coal industry is intensely competitive primarily as a result of the existence of numerous producers 
pvr s lessees compete with both large and small coal producers in various regions of the united states for domestic sales 
the industry has undergone significant consolidation which has led to some of the competitors of pvr s lessees having significantly larger financial and operating resources than most of pvr s lessees 
pvr s lessees compete on the basis of coal price at the mine  coal quality including sulfur content  transportation cost from the mine to the customer and the reliability of supply 
continued demand for pvr s coal and the prices that pvr s lessees obtain are also affected by demand for electricity  demand for metallurgical coal  access to transportation  environmental and government regulations  technological developments and the availability and price of alternative fuel supplies  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and hydroelectric power 
demand for pvr s low sulfur coal and the prices pvr s lessees will be able to obtain for it will also be affected by the price and availability of high sulfur coal  which can be marketed in tandem with emissions allowances which permit the high sulfur coal to meet federal clean air act requirements 
pvr natural gas midstream segment the ability to offer natural gas producers competitive gathering and processing arrangements and subsequent reliable service is fundamental to obtaining and keeping gas supplies for pvr s gathering systems 
the primary concerns of the producer are the pressure maintained on the system at the point of receipt  the relative volumes of gas consumed as fuel and lost  the gathering processing fees charged  the timeliness of well connects  the customer service orientation of the gatherer processor  and the reliability of the field services provided 
pvr experiences competition in all of its natural gas midstream markets 
pvr s competitors include major integrated oil companies  interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather  compress  process  transport and market natural gas 
many of pvr s competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger natural gas supplies than pvr does 

table of contents government regulation and environmental matters the operations of our oil and gas business and pvr s coal and natural resource management business and natural gas midstream business are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
oil and gas segment state regulatory matters 
various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted 
all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas 
these provisions include permitting regulations regarding the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells  locating wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the number of wells that may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
federal energy regulatory commission 
the federal energy regulatory commission  or the ferc  regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of  or the nga  and the natural gas policy act of  or the ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting producers wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while sales by producers of their own natural gas production and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
commencing in april  the ferc issued order nos 
 a  b and c  or order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sale of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
although order no 
does not directly regulate gas producers like us  the ferc has stated that it intends for order no 
to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
the courts have largely affirmed the significant features of order no 
and numerous related orders pertaining to the individual pipelines  although certain appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations 
in particular  the ferc has issued order nos 
 a and b which  among other things  i permit pipelines to charge different maximum cost based rates for peak and off peak periods  ii encourage auctions for pipeline capacity  iii require pipelines to implement imbalance management services and iv restrict the ability of pipelines to impose penalties for imbalances  overruns and non compliance with operational flow orders 
the energy policy act of amended the nga and the ngpa and gave the ferc the authority to assess civil penalties of up to million per day per violation for violations of rules  regulations  and orders issued under these acts 
in addition  the ferc has issued regulations that make it unlawful for any entity in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc to use any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect us only indirectly  these changes are intended to further enhance competition in  and prevent manipulation of  natural gas markets 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can we predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve its stated goal of increasing competition in  and preventing manipulation of  natural gas markets 
however  we do not believe that we will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers with which we compete 
environmental matters 
extensive federal  state and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws that are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup 
table of contents costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
in addition  state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect our operations  as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us 
nevertheless  changes in existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect our operations 
osha 
we are subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act  or osha  and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
pvr coal and natural resource management segment general regulation applicable to coal lessees 
pvr s lessees are obligated to conduct mining operations in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include matters involving the discharge of materials into the environment  employee health and safety  mine permits and other licensing requirements  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  management of materials generated by mining operations  surface subsidence from underground mining  water pollution  legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners  air quality standards  protection of wetlands  plant and wildlife protection  limitations on land use  storage of petroleum products and substances which are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws and management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls  or pcbs 
these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements are closely enforced  pvr s lessees regularly have on site inspections and violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry  notwithstanding compliance efforts by pvr s lessees 
however  none of the violations to date  or the monetary penalties assessed  have been material to us  pvr or  to our knowledge  to pvr s lessees 
although many new safety requirements have been instituted recently  pvr does not currently expect that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on pvr 
while it is not possible to quantify the costs of compliance by pvr s lessees with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant 
the lessees post performance bonds pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary 
we do not accrue for such costs because pvr s lessees are contractually liable for all costs relating to their mining operations  including the costs of reclamation and mine closure 
however  pvr does require some smaller lessees to deposit into escrow certain funds for reclamation and mine closure costs or post performance bonds for these costs 
although we believe that the lessees typically accrue adequate amounts for these costs  their future operating results would be adversely affected if they later determined these accruals to be insufficient 
compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for all domestic coal producers 
in addition  the utility industry  which is the most significant end user of coal  is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities which could affect demand for coal mined by pvr s lessees 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which have a significant impact on the mining operations of pvr s lessees or their customers ability to use coal and may require pvr  its lessees or their customers to change operations significantly or incur substantial costs 
air emissions 
the clean air act  or the caa  and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of pvr s business  both directly and indirectly 
the caa directly impacts pvr s lessees coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and  in some cases  requirements to install certain emissions control equipment  on sources that emit various hazardous and non hazardous air pollutants 
the caa also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal fired electric power generating plants 
there have been a series of recent federal rulemakings that are focused on emissions from coal fired electric generating facilities 
installation of additional emissions control technology and additional measures required under us environmental protection agency  or the epa  laws and regulations will make it more costly to build and operate coal fired power plants and  depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans  could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future 
any reduction in coal s share of power generating capacity could negatively impact pvr s lessees ability to sell coal  which could have a material effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 

table of contents the epa s acid rain program  provided in title iv of the caa  regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities 
sulfur dioxide is a by product of coal combustion 
affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances  which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility s sulfur dioxide emissions in that year 
affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions 
in addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances  affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the epa s acid rain program by switching to lower sulfur fuels  installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems  or scrubbers  or by reducing electricity generating levels 
the epa has promulgated rules  referred to as the nox sip call  that require coal fired power plants and other large stationary sources in eastern states and washington dc to make substantial reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions in an effort to reduce the impacts of ozone transport between states 
additionally  in march  the epa issued the final clean air interstate rule  or cair  which will permanently cap nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in eastern states and washington  dc beginning in and cair requires these states to achieve the required emission reductions by requiring power plants to either participate in an epa administered cap and trade program that caps emission in two phases  or by meeting an individual state emissions budget through measures established by the state 
the stringency of the caps under cair may require many coal fired sources to install additional pollution control equipment  such as wet scrubbers  to comply 
this increased sulfur emission removal capability required by cair could result in decreased demand for lower sulfur coal  which may potentially drive down prices for lower sulfur coal 
in march  the epa finalized the clean air mercury rule  or camr  which was to establish a two part  nationwide cap on mercury emissions from coal fired power plants beginning in it was the subject of extensive controversy and litigation and  in february  the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated camr 
epa has not yet indicated if it will appeal the decision or how it will proceed with the regulation of mercury emissions 
various states have promulgated or are considering more stringent emission limits on mercury emissions from coal fired electric generating units 
the epa has adopted new  more stringent national air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
as a result  some states will be required to amend their existing state implementation plans to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards 
in march  the epa published final rules addressing how states would implement plans to bring regions designated as non attainment for fine particulate matter into compliance with the new air quality standard 
under the epa s final rule  states have until april to submit their implementation plans to the epa for approval 
because coal mining operations and coal fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter  pvr s lessees mining operations and their customers could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the applicable states 
likewise  the epa s regional haze program to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas required affected states to develop implementation plans by december that  among other things  identify facilities that will have to reduce emissions and comply with stricter emission limitations 
this program may restrict construction of new coal fired power plants where emissions are projected to reduce visibility in protected areas 
in addition  this program may require certain existing coal fired power plants to install emissions control equipment to reduce haze causing emissions such as sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide and particulate matter 
the us department of justice  on behalf of the epa  has filed lawsuits against a number of coal fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the caa 
the epa has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining permits required under the new source review program 
several of these lawsuits have settled  but others remain pending 
on april   the united states supreme court ruled in one such case  environmental defense v 
duke energy corp 
the court held that epa is not required to use an hourly rate test in determining whether a modification to a coal burning utility requires a permit under the new source review program  thus allowing the epa to apply a test based on average annual emissions 
the use of an annual emissions test could subject more coal fired utility modification projects to the permitting requirements of the caa new source review program  such as those that allow plants to run for more hours in a given year 
however  duke is expected to continue to contest remaining issues in the case  and so litigation in this and other pending cases will likely continue 
depending on the ultimate resolution of these cases  demand for pvr s coal could be affected  which could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
carbon dioxide emissions 
the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change calls for developed nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to below levels by carbon dioxide  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels  is subject to the kyoto protocol 
the kyoto protocol went into effect on february  for those nations that ratified the treaty 
in  the united states withdrew 
table of contents its support for the kyoto protocol  and the united states is not participating in this treaty 
since the kyoto protocol became effective  there has been increasing international pressure on the united states to adopt mandatory restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions 
in addition  on april  the united states supreme court held in massachusetts v 
epa that unless the epa affirmatively concludes that greenhouse gases are not causing climate change  the epa must regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new automobiles under the caa 
the supreme court remanded the matter to the epa for further consideration 
this litigation did not directly concern the epa s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources  such as coal mining operations or coal fired power plants 
however  the court s decision is likely to influence another lawsuit currently pending in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  involving a challenge to the epa s decision not to regulate carbon dioxide from power plants and other stationary sources under a caa new source performance standard rule  which specifies emissions limits for new facilities 
the court remanded that question to epa for further consideration in light of the ruling in massachusetts v 
epa  but any decision in this case or any regulatory action by the epa limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants could impact the demand for pvr s coal  which could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
the permitting of a number of proposed new coal fired power plants has also recently been contested by environmental organizations for concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions from new plants 
in october  state regulators in kansas became the first to deny an air emissions construction permit for a new coal fired power plant based on the plant s projected emissions of carbon dioxide 
state regulatory authorities in florida and north carolina have also rejected the construction of new coal fired power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emission of carbon dioxide 
in addition  permits for several new coal fired power plants without limits imposed on their greenhouse gas emissions have been appealed by environmental organizations to the us epa s environmental appeals board 
several states have also either passed legislation or announced initiatives focused on decreasing or stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels  and many of these measures have focused on emissions from coal fired electric generating facilities 
for example  in december  seven northeastern states agreed to implement a regional cap and trade program  referred to as the regional greenhouse gas initiative  or the rggi  to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions from regional power plants beginning in this initiative aims to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide to levels roughly corresponding to average annual emissions between and massachusetts and rhode island agreed to join this group in february and maryland agreed to join the group in april the members of rggi agreed to seek to establish in statute and or regulation a carbon dioxide trading program and have each state s component of the regional program effective no later than december  following the rggi model  seven western states have also formed a regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative known as the western regional climate action initiative  which calls for an overall reduction of regional greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial and commercial sources in participating states through trading of emissions credits beginning in also  in  the governor of california signed assembly bill into law  requiring the california air resources board to develop regulations and market mechanisms to reduce california s greenhouse gas emissions by by with mandatory caps beginning in for significant sources 
several different pieces of legislation were introduced in congress in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
such or similar federal legislation could be taken in or later years 
it is possible that future federal and state initiatives to control and put a price on carbon dioxide emissions could result in increased costs associated with coal consumption  such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs 
such increased costs for coal consumption could result in some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel  which could negatively impact pvr s lessees coal sales  and thereby have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
surface mining control and reclamation act of the surface mining control and reclamation act of  or smcra  and similar state statutes establish minimum national operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining  as well as most aspects of deep mining 
smcra requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities 
smcra also imposes on mine operators the responsibility of restoring the land to its original state and compensating the landowner for types of damages occurring as a result of mining operations  and require mine operators to post performance bonds to ensure compliance with any reclamation obligations on the theory that pvr owned or controlled the mine operator in such a way for liability to attach 
regulatory authorities may attempt to assign the liabilities of pvr s coal lessees to another entity such as pvr if any of its lessees are not financially capable of fulfilling those obligations 
to our knowledge  no such claims have been asserted against pvr to date 
in conjunction with mining the property  pvr s coal lessees are contractually obligated under the terms of their leases to comply with all state and local laws  including smcra  with obligations including the reclamation and restoration of the mined areas by grading  shaping and reseeding the soil 
upon completion of the mining  reclamation generally is completed by seeding with grasses or planting trees for use as pasture or timberland  as 
table of contents specified in the approved reclamation plan 
additionally  the abandoned mine lands program  which is part of smcra  imposes a tax on all current mining operations  the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed before the maximum tax is cents per ton on surface mined coal and cents per ton on underground mined coal 
this tax was set to expire on june   but the program was extended until september  federal and state laws require bonds to secure our lessees obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis 
it has become increasingly difficult for mining companies to secure new surety bonds without the posting of partial collateral 
in addition  surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
it is possible that surety bonds issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals 
any failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on pvr s lessees ability to produce coal  which could affect pvr s coal royalties revenues 
hazardous materials and wastes 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  or the superfund law  and analogous state laws  impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
some products used by coal companies in operations generate waste containing hazardous substances 
pvr could become liable under federal and state superfund and waste management statutes if its lessees are unable to pay environmental cleanup costs 
cercla authorizes the epa and  in some cases  third parties  to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek recovery from the responsible classes of persons of the costs they incurred in connection with such response 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other wastes released into the environment 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and corresponding state laws and regulations exclude many mining wastes from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes 
currently  the management and disposal of coal combustion by products are also not regulated at the federal level and not uniformly at the state level 
if rules are adopted to regulate the management and disposal of these by products  they could add additional costs to the use of coal as a fuel and may encourage power plant operators to switch to a different fuel 
clean water act 
pvr s coal lessees operations are regulated under the clean water act  or the cwa  with respect to discharges of pollutants  including dredged or fill material into waters of the united states 
individual or general permits under section of the cwa are required to conduct dredge or fill activities in jurisdictional waters of the united states 
surface coal mining operators obtain these permits to authorize such activities as the creation of slurry ponds  stream impoundments and valley fills 
uncertainty over what legally constitutes a navigable water of the united states within the cwa s regulatory scope may adversely impact the ability of pvr s coal lessees to secure the necessary permits for their mining activities 
some surface mining activities require a cwa section dredge and fill permit under the cwa for valley fills and the associated sediment control ponds 
on june   in response to the us supreme court s divided opinion in rapanos v 
united states  the epa and the us army corps of engineers  or the corps  issued joint guidance to epa regions and corps districts interpreting the geographic extent of regulatory jurisdiction under section of the cwa 
specifically  the guidance places jurisdictional water bodies into two groups waters where the agencies will assert regulatory jurisdiction categorically and waters where the agencies will assert jurisdiction on a case by case basis following a significant nexus analysis 
it remains to be seen how this guidance will affect the permitting process for obtaining additional permits for valley fills and sediment ponds although it is likely to add uncertainty and delays in the issuance of new permits 
some valley fill surface mining activities have the potential to impact headwater streams that are not relatively permanent  which could therefore trigger a detailed significant nexus analysis to determine whether a section permit would be required 
such analyses could require the extensive collection of additional field data and could lead to delays in the issuance of cwa section permits for valley fill surface mining operations 
recent federal district court decisions in west virginia  and related litigation filed in federal district court in kentucky  have created additional uncertainty regarding the future ability to obtain certain general permits authorizing the construction of valley fills for the disposal of overburden from mining operations 
the corps is authorized by section of the cwa to issue nationwide permits for specific categories of dredging and filling activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse environmental effects 
nationwide permit authorizes the disposal of dredged or fill material from surface coal mining activities into the waters of the united states 
a july decision by the southern district of west virginia in ohio valley environmental coalition v 
bulen enjoined the huntington district of the corps 
table of contents from issuing further permits pursuant to nationwide permit while the decision was vacated by the fourth circuit court of appeals in november  it has been remanded to the district court for the southern district of west virginia for further proceedings 
moreover  a similar lawsuit has been filed in the us district court for the eastern district of kentucky that seeks to enjoin the issuance of permits pursuant to nationwide permit by the louisville district of the corps 
in the event similar lawsuits prove to be successful in adjoining jurisdictions  pvr s lessees may be required to apply for individual discharge permits pursuant to section of the cwa in areas where they would have otherwise utilized nationwide permit such a change could result in delays in pvr s lessees obtaining the required mining permits to conduct their operations  which could in turn have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
individual cwa section permits for valley fills associated with surface mining activities are also subject to certain legal challenges and uncertainty 
on september   in the case ohio valley environmental coalition ovec v 
united states army corps of engineers  environmental group plaintiffs filed suit in the us district court for the southern district of west virginia challenging the corps decision to issue individual cwa section permits for certain mining projects 
alex energy  inc  or alex energy  a lessee of pvr that operates the republic no 
mine in kanawha county  west virginia  intervened as a defendant in this litigation when the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add the december  individual cwa section permit for the republic no 
mine  or the republic no 
permit 
on march   the district court rescinded several challenged cwa section permits  including the republic no 
permit  and remanded the permit applications to the corps for further proceedings 
in addition  the district court enjoined the permit holders  including alex energy  from all activities authorized under the rescinded permits 
as part of the ovec litigation  the environmental groups have also challenged the cwa section permit issued to alex energy for the republic no 
mine  also located in kanawha county  west virginia 
on april   alex energy filed a notice of appeal of the march  ruling to the united states court of appeals 
on may   the corps and the west virginia mining association also filed notices of appeal as defendants 
on april   the district court granted a limited stay of its previous order to allow certain valley fills already partially constructed where the receiving waters had been filled 
this limited stay specifically allows alex energy to continue to use valley fill no 
with respect to the republic no 
mine  however  construction of the other valley fills and sediment ponds remain enjoined pending appeal 
in december  plaintiff environmental groups brought a similar suit against the issuance of a cwa section permit for a surface coal mine in the us district court for the eastern district of kentucky  alleging identical violations 
the corps has voluntarily suspended its consideration of the permit application in that case for agency re evaluation 
while the final outcome of these cases remains uncertain  if the ovec lawsuit ultimately limits or prohibits the mining methods or operations of pvr s lessees  it could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
in addition  it is possible that similar litigation affecting recently issued  pending or future individual or general cwa section permits relevant to the mining and related operations of pvr s lessees could adversely impact pvr s coal royalties revenues 
total maximum daily load  or tmdl  regulations under the cwa establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet state water quality standards and to allocate pollutant loads among the point and non point pollutant sources discharging into that water body 
this process applies to those waters that states have designated as impaired not meeting present water quality standards 
industrial dischargers  including coal mines  discharging to such waters will be required to meet new tmdl load allocations for these stream segments 
the adoption of new tmdl related allocations for streams to which pvr s lessees coal mining operations discharge could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect pvr s lessees coal production 
the cwa also requires states to develop anti degradation policies to ensure non impaired water bodies in the state do not fall below applicable water quality standards 
these and other regulatory developments may restrict pvr s lessees ability to develop new mines or could require pvr s lessees to modify existing operations  which could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal business 
the safe drinking water act  or the sdwa  and its state equivalents affect coal mining operations by imposing requirements on the underground injection of fine coal slurries  fly ash and flue gas scrubber sludge  and by requiring permits to conduct such underground injection activities 
in addition to establishing the underground injection control program  the sdwa also imposes regulatory requirements on owners and operators of public water systems 
this regulatory program could impact pvr s lessees reclamation operations where subsidence or other mining related problems require the provision of drinking water to affected adjacent homeowners 
endangered species act 
the endangered species act and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction 
protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying pvr s 
table of contents lessees from obtaining mining permits and may include restrictions on timber harvesting  road building and other mining or agricultural activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats 
a number of species indigenous to areas where pvr s properties are located are protected under the endangered species act 
based on the species that have been identified to date and the current application of applicable laws and regulations  however  we do not believe there are any species protected under the endangered species act that would materially and adversely affect pvr s lessees ability to mine coal from pvr s properties in accordance with current mining plans 
mine health and safety laws 
the operations of pvr s coal lessees are subject to stringent health and safety standards that have been imposed by federal legislation since the adoption of the mine health and safety act of the mine health and safety act of resulted in increased operating costs and reduced productivity 
the mine safety and health act of  which significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards of the mine health and safety act of  imposes comprehensive health and safety standards on all mining operations 
in addition  as part of the mine health and safety acts of and  the black lung acts require payments of benefits by all businesses conducting current mining operations to coal miners with black lung or pneumoconiosis and to some beneficiaries of miners who have died from this disease 
recent mining accidents in west virginia and kentucky have received national attention and instigated responses at the state and national level that are likely to result in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at all mining operations  particularly underground mining operations 
in january  west virginia passed a law imposing stringent new mine safety and accident reporting requirements and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of mine safety laws 
on march   new mexico governor bill richardson signed into law an expanded miner safety program including more stringent requirements for accident reporting and the installation of additional mine safety equipment at underground mines 
similarly  on april   kentucky governor ernie fletcher signed mine safety legislation that includes requirements for increased inspections of underground mines and additional mine safety equipment and authorizes the assessment of penalties of up to  per incident for violations of mine ventilation or roof control requirements 
on june   the president signed the miner act  which was new mining safety legislation that mandates improvements in mine safety practices  increases civil and criminal penalties for non compliance  requires the creation of additional mine rescue teams and expands the scope of federal oversight  inspection and enforcement activities 
pursuant to the miner act  the mine safety health administration  or msha  has promulgated new emergency rules on mine safety and revised msha s civil penalty assessment regulations  which resulted in an across the board increase in penalties from the existing regulations 
these requirements may add significant costs to pvr s lessees operations  particularly for underground mines  and could affect the financial performance of pvr s lessees operations 
implementing and complying with these new laws and regulations could adversely affect pvr s lessees coal production and could therefore have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
mining permits and approvals 
numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations 
in connection with obtaining these permits and approvals  pvr s coal lessees may be required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed production of coal may have upon the environment 
the requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of mining operations 
under some circumstances  substantial fines and penalties  including revocation of mining permits  may be imposed under the laws described above 
monetary sanctions and  in severe circumstances  criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws 
regulations also provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls  directly or indirectly through other entities  mining operations which have outstanding environmental violations 
although  like other coal companies  pvr s lessees have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of business  to our knowledge  none of them have had one of their permits suspended or revoked because of any violation  and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material 
in order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities  mine operators  including pvr s lessees  must submit a reclamation plan for restoring  upon the completion of mining operations  the mined property to its prior condition  productive use or other permitted condition 
typically  pvr s lessees submit the necessary permit applications between and months before they plan to begin mining a new area 
in pvr s experience  permits generally are approved within months after a completed application is submitted 
in the past  pvr s lessees have generally obtained their mining permits without significant delay 
pvr s lessees have obtained or applied for permits to mine a majority of the reserves that are currently planned to be mined over the next five years 
pvr s lessees are also in the planning phase for obtaining permits for the additional reserves planned to be mined over the following five years 
however  there are no 
table of contents assurances that they will not experience difficulty in obtaining mining permits in the future

pvr natural gas midstream segment general regulation 
pvr s natural gas gathering facilities generally are exempt from the ferc s jurisdiction under the nga  but ferc regulation nevertheless could significantly affect pvr s gathering business and the market for its services 
in recent years  the ferc has pursued pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines into which pvr s gathering pipelines deliver 
however  we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transportation capacity 
for example  the ferc will assert jurisdiction over an affiliated gatherer that acts to benefit its pipeline affiliate in a manner that is contrary to the ferc s policies concerning jurisdictional services adopted pursuant to the nga 
in addition  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels now that the ferc has taken a less stringent approach to regulation of the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies and a number of such companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates 
pvr s gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 
pvr s gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of gathering facilities 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  such changes might have on pvr s natural gas midstream operations  but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 
in texas  pvr s gathering facilities are subject to regulation by the texas railroad commission  which has the authority to ensure that rates  terms and conditions of gas utilities  including certain gathering facilities  are just and reasonable and not discriminatory 
pvr s operations in oklahoma are regulated by the oklahoma corporation commission  which prohibits pvr from charging any unduly discriminatory fees for its gathering services 
we cannot predict whether pvr s gathering rates will be found to be unjust  unreasonable or unduly discriminatory 
pvr is subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in texas and oklahoma 
ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take  without undue discrimination  natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling 
similarly  common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer 
these statutes have the effect of restricting pvr s right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas 
federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states  and texas and oklahoma have adopted complaint based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering rates and access 
we cannot assure you that federal and state authorities will retain their current regulatory policies in the future 
texas and oklahoma administer federal pipeline safety standards under the natural gas pipeline safety act of  or the ngpsa  which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines  and subjects pipelines to regular inspections 
in response to recent pipeline accidents  congress and the us department of transportation have instituted heightened pipeline safety requirements 
certain of pvr s gathering facilities are exempt from these federal pipeline safety requirements under the rural gathering exemption 
we cannot assure you that the rural gathering exemption will be retained in its current form in the future 
failure to comply with applicable regulations under the nga  the ngpsa and certain state laws can result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal remedies 
air emissions 
pvr s natural gas midstream operations are subject to the caa and comparable state laws and regulations 
see pvr coal and natural resource management segment air emissions 
these laws and regulations govern emissions of pollutants into the air resulting from the activities of pvr s processing plants and compressor stations and also impose procedural requirements on how pvr conducts its natural gas midstream operations 
such laws and regulations may include requirements that pvr obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions  strictly comply with the emissions and operational limitations of air emissions permits pvr is required to obtain or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 
pvr s failure to comply with these requirements could subject it to monetary penalties  injunctions  conditions or restrictions on operations  and 
table of contents potentially criminal enforcement actions 
pvr will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions 
hazardous materials and wastes 
pvr s natural gas midstream operations could incur liability under cercla and comparable state laws resulting from the disposal or other release of hazardous substances or wastes originating from properties pvr owns or operates  regardless of whether such disposal or release occurred during or prior to pvr s acquisition of such properties 
see pvr coal and natural resource management segment hazardous materials and waste 
although petroleum  including natural gas and ngls are generally excluded from cercla s definition of hazardous substance  pvr s natural gas midstream operations do generate wastes in the course of ordinary operations that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
pvr s natural gas midstream operations generate wastes  including some hazardous wastes  which are subject to rcra and comparable state laws 
however  rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste 
specifically  rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy 
unrecovered petroleum product wastes  however  may still be regulated under rcra as solid waste 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the transportation of natural gas and ngls in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes 
although pvr believes that it is unlikely that the rcra exemption will be repealed in the near future  repeal would increase costs for waste disposal and environmental remediation at pvr s facilities 
pvr currently owns or leases numerous properties that for many years have been used for the measurement  gathering  field compression and processing of natural gas and ngls 
although pvr believes that the operators of such properties used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under such properties or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws  pvr could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination  whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
pvr has ongoing remediation projects underway at several sites  but it does not believe that the costs associated with such cleanups will have a material adverse impact on pvr s operations or revenues 
water discharges 
pvr s natural gas midstream operations are subject to the cwa 
see pvr coal and natural resource management segment clean water act 
any unpermitted release of pollutants  including ngls or condensates  from pvr s systems or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations

however  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we may currently deem immaterial  may become important factors that harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

table of contents risks related to our oil and gas business natural gas and crude oil prices are volatile  and a substantial or extended decline in prices would hurt our profitability and financial condition 
our revenues  operating results  cash flow  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and gas properties depend heavily on prevailing market prices for natural gas and crude oil 
historically  natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
wide fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control  including domestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas  political and economic conditions in oil or gas producing regions  overall domestic and foreign economic conditions  prices and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of transportation facilities  weather conditions  and domestic and foreign governmental regulation 
some of our projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas and crude oil 
these price assumptions are used for planning purposes 
we expect our assumptions will change over time and that actual prices in the future will likely differ from our estimates 
any substantial or extended decline in the actual prices of natural gas or crude oil would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity and possible asset impairment  the quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that we can economically produce  the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties and our ability to fund our capital program 
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce  our reserves will decline  eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations 
we have historically succeeded in substantially replacing reserves through acquisitions  exploration and development 
we have conducted such activities on our existing oil and gas properties as well as on newly acquired properties 
we may not be able to continue to replace reserves from such activities at acceptable costs 
lower oil and gas prices may further limit the types of reserves that can be developed at acceptable costs 
lower prices also decrease our cash flows and may cause us to reduce capital expenditures 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
we may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flows from operations are reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
in addition  exploration and development activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes  the failure to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 
we are continually identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities  including acquisitions that would be significantly larger than those we have consummated to date 
however  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us 
we cannot ensure that we will successfully consummate any acquisition  that we will be able to acquire producing oil and gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that any acquisition will be profitably integrated into our operations 
we may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures to find  acquire  develop  exploit and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
our capital expenditures for oil and gas properties were million for  and we have budgeted total capital expenditures of approximately million in if oil and gas prices decrease or we encounter operating difficulties that result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected  we may have to reduce the capital 
table of contents we can spend unless we raise additional funds through debt or equity financing 
debt or equity financing  cash generated by operations or borrowing capacity may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms to meet these requirements 
future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells  and prices of oil and natural gas 
issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing requirements could cause substantial dilution to existing shareholders 
debt financing could lead to us being more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
if our revenues were to decrease due to lower oil and natural gas prices  decreased production or other reasons  and if we could not obtain capital through our revolving credit facility or otherwise  our ability to execute our development plans  replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reserves will be found 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment  shortages in experienced labor  failure to secure necessary regulatory approvals and permits  fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  and adverse weather conditions 
the prevailing prices of oil and gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
the availability of drilling rigs can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand  an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region 
another significant risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state  local and other governmental authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and drilling permits  including delays which jeopardize our ability to realize the potential benefits from leased properties within the applicable lease periods  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on or develop our properties 
the wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that natural gas or oil is present or may be produced economically 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
drilling activities can result in dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling costs 
our future drilling activities may not be successful  nor can we be sure that our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular area will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  we may not be able to obtain any options 
table of contents or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify 
although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations  we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from all of them 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers  and nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers would reduce our cash flows 
we are subject to risk from loss resulting from our customers nonperformance or nonpayment 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues from our oil and gas segment 
in  two of our oil and gas customers accounted for of our natural gas and oil and condensate revenues and of our total consolidated revenues 
any nonpayment or nonperformance by our oil and gas customers would reduce our cash flows 
our business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate 
our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the exploitation  development and exploration for  and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas 
these operating risks include fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering and casing collapses  formations with abnormal pressures  pipeline ruptures or spills  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could result in substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damages  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations 
in addition  under certain circumstances  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own  lease or operate 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities  which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
the occurrence of a significant event  not fully insured or indemnified against  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
our business depends on transportation facilities owned by others 
we deliver substantially all of our oil and natural gas production through pipelines that we do not own 
the marketability of our production depends upon the availability  proximity and capacity of these pipelines as well as gathering systems and processing facilities 
the unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
federal  state and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and market our oil and natural gas 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are not precise 
this annual report on form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
these estimates are dependent on many variables and  therefore  changes often occur as these variables evolve and commodity prices fluctuate 

table of contents actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed by us 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped 
estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves is based on volumetric calculations and adjacent reserve performance data 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
production revenues from proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized until some time in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  these estimated costs may not be accurate  development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not occur as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of estimated future net cash flows standardized measure referred to herein is the current fair value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual current and future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
as a result  net present value estimates using actual prices and costs may be significantly less than the sec estimate that is provided herein 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for us 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate a portion of our net production 
in  other companies operated approximately of our net production 
our success in properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs 
certain working interest owners in our properties have the right to control the timing of drilling activities on our properties under certain circumstances 
under certain circumstances  certain of the other working interest owners in our properties have the right to limit the amount of drilling activities that can take place on our properties at any given time 
if these working interest owners chose to exercise this right  we could be required to scale back anticipated drilling activities on the affected properties 
in such an event  production from the affected properties would be deferred  thereby decreasing production from the properties in the short term 
our producing property acquisitions carry significant risks 
acquisition of producing oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production 
competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense 
the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the purchase price  future oil and gas prices  the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves  future operating and capital costs  results of future exploration  exploitation and 
table of contents development activities on the acquired properties and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
a customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems 
additionally  significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 
to the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties  our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited 
integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks 
these risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees 
any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short term or long term effects on our operating results  and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
responses to recent coal mining accidents could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our conventional and cbm drilling operations in appalachia take place in close proximity to coal mining operations 
recent coal mining disasters in west virginia and kentucky have received state and national attention that is resulting in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at and around coal mining operations 
this scrutiny could result in the promulgation of more stringent regulations for the permitting of oil and gas wells in close proximity to coal mining operations  which could make it more difficult  time consuming and costly for us to obtain such permits and could adversely affect our natural gas production and reduce our oil and natural gas revenues 
derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the sale of our oil and natural gas  we periodically enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of two years or less 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil or natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements 
in trying to maintain an appropriate balance  we may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how oil or natural gas prices fluctuate in the future 
in addition  derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
in addition  derivative instruments involve basis risk 
basis risk in a derivative contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
for example  a nymex index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including complex environmental laws 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or a failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection and taxation 
our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water 
in the event of environmental violations  we may be charged with remedial costs 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may  in some circumstances  result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault 
in addition  pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
these liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents risks related to our ownership interests in pvg and pvr we are not the only partners of pvg and pvr  and pvg s and pvr s respective partnership agreements require them to distribute all available cash to their respective partners  including public unitholders 
pvg and pvr are publicly traded limited partnerships 
we own pvg gp  llc  the sole general partner of pvg 
as of december   we also owned an approximately limited partner interest in pvg 
as of december   pvg owned approximately of pvr  consisting of a general partner interest and an approximately limited partner interest in pvr  as well as the incentive distribution rights in pvr 
we directly owned an additional limited partner interest in pvr as of december  the remainder of the outstanding limited partner interests in each of pvg and pvr are owned by public unitholders 
although pvg s and pvr s respective partnership agreements require them to distribute  on a quarterly basis  of their available cash to their respective unitholders of record and their respective general partners  we are not the only limited partners of pvg and pvr and  therefore  we receive only our proportionate share of cash distributions from each of pvg and pvr based on our partner interests in each of them 
the remainder of the quarterly cash distributions are distributed  pro rata  to the public unitholders 
for each of pvg and pvr  available cash is generally all cash on hand at the end of each quarter  after payment of fees and expenses and the establishment of cash reserves by their respective general partners 
pvg s and pvr s general partners determine the amount and timing of cash distributions by pvg and pvr and have broad discretion to establish and make additions to the respective partnership s reserves or the reserves of the respective partnership s operating subsidiaries in amounts the general partner determines to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the proper conduct of the business and the businesses of the operating subsidiaries including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs  to provide funds for distributions to the respective unitholders and the respective general partner for any one or more of the next four calendar quarters  or to comply with applicable law or any loan or other agreements 
accordingly  cash distributions we receive on our partner interests in pvg and pvr may be reduced at any time  or we may not receive any cash distributions from pvg or pvr  which would in turn reduce our cash available to service our debt 
pvg s ability to make distributions to us is entirely dependent upon pvg s receiving distributions from pvr  and the amount of cash that pvr will be able to distribute to its unitholders  including pvg  principally depends upon the amount of cash it can generate from its coal and natural gas midstream businesses 
pvg s earnings and cash flow consist exclusively of cash distributions from pvr 
consequently  a significant decline in pvr s earnings or cash distributions would have a negative impact on its distributions to its partners  including us 
the amount of cash that pvr will be able to distribute to its partners  including pvg  each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it can generate from its coal and natural resource management and natural gas midstream businesses 
the amount of cash that pvr will generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the amount of coal its lessees are able to produce  the price at which its lessees are able to sell the coal  its lessees timely receipt of payment from their customers  the amount of natural gas transported in its gathering systems  the amount of throughput in its processing plants  the price of natural gas  the price of ngls  the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  the fees it charges and the margins it realizes for its natural gas midstream services  and its hedging activities 

table of contents in addition  the actual amount of cash that pvr will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond its control  including the level of capital expenditures it makes  the cost of acquisitions  if any  its debt service requirements  fluctuations in its working capital needs  restrictions on distributions contained in its debt agreements  prevailing economic conditions  and the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion for the proper conduct of its business 
because of these factors  pvr may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to continue paying distributions at their current level or at all 
if pvr reduces its per unit distribution  pvg will have less cash available for distribution to its unitholders  including us  and would probably be required to reduce its per unit distribution to its unitholders  including us 
you should also be aware that the amount of cash that pvr has available for distribution depends primarily upon pvr s cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and is not solely a function of profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  pvr may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records profits 
in addition  the timing and amount  if any  of an increase or decrease in distributions by pvr to its unitholders will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of any changes in distributions made by pvg 
pvg s ability to distribute cash received from pvr to its unitholders  including us  is limited by a number of factors  including restrictions on distributions contained in any future debt agreements  pvg s estimated general and administrative expenses  including expenses it will incur as a result of being a public company as well as other operating expenses  expenses of pvr s general partner and pvr  reserves necessary for pvg to make the necessary capital contributions to maintain its general partner interest in pvr  as required by pvr s partnership agreement upon the issuance of additional partnership securities by pvr  and reserves pvg s general partner believes prudent for pvg to maintain the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions by pvg 
a reduction in pvr s distributions will disproportionately affect the amount of cash distributions to which pvg is currently entitled  and  consequently  will affect the amount of cash distributions pvg is able to make to its unitholders  including us 
pvg s ownership of the incentive distribution rights in pvr  through pvg s ownership of pvr s general partner  the holder of the incentive distribution rights  entitles pvg to receive its pro rata share of specified percentages of total cash distributions made by pvr with respect to any particular quarter only in the event that pvr distributes more than per unit for such quarter 
as a result  the holders of pvr s common units have a priority over the holders of pvr s incentive distribution rights to the extent of cash distributions by pvr up to and including per unit for any quarter 
pvg s incentive distribution rights entitle it to receive increasing percentages  up to  of incremental cash distributions above per unit  on an annualized basis  distributed by pvr 
because pvg is at the maximum target cash distribution level on the incentive distribution rights  future growth in distributions pvg receives from pvr  and in distributions we receive from pvg  will not result from an increase in the target cash distribution level associated with the incentive distribution rights 
furthermore  a decrease in the amount of distributions by pvr to less than per unit per quarter would reduce pvg s percentage of the incremental cash distributions above per common unit per quarter from to  consequently resulting in less cash available to pvg to distribute to its unitholders  including us 
a decrease in the amount of distribution by pvr and  consequently  pvg may be caused by a variety of circumstances 
pvr may generate less cash available for distributions or determine to create larger reserves in computing cash available for distribution 
even 
table of contents if cash available for distribution remained stable  pvg and pvr may determine to modify the incentive distribution rights to reduce the percentage of incremental cash distributions such incentive distribution rights are entitled to receive 
pvr may issue additional limited partner interests or other equity securities  which may increase the risk that pvr will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase its cash distribution level  which in turn may reduce the available cash that pvg has to distribute to its unitholders  including us 
pvr has wide latitude to issue additional limited partner interests on the terms and conditions established by its general partner 
pvg receives cash distributions from pvr on the general partner interest  incentive distribution rights and the limited partner interest that pvg holds 
because a majority of the cash pvg receives from pvr is attributable to pvg s ownership of the incentive distribution rights  payment of distributions on additional pvr limited partner interests may increase the risk that pvr will be unable to maintain or increase its quarterly cash distribution per unit  which in turn may reduce the amount of incentive distributions pvg receives and the available cash that pvg has to distribute to its unitholders  including us 
conflicts of interest may arise because the board of directors of the respective general partners of pvg and pvr have a fiduciary duty to manage the general partners in a manner that is beneficial to their owners  and at the same time  in a manner that is beneficial to the respective unitholders of pvg and pvr 
we own the sole general partner of pvg and pvg owns the sole general partner of pvr 
pvg and pvr are publicly traded limited partnerships 
each of the board of directors of the general partners owes a fiduciary duty to the respective unitholders of pvg and pvr  and not just to us and pvg as owners of the general partners 
as a result of these conflicts  the board of directors of the general partners of pvg and pvr may favor the interests of the public unitholders of pvg and pvr over the interests of the respective owners of the general partners 
our ability to sell our common units of pvg  and pvg s ability to sell its partner interests in pvr  may be limited by securities law restrictions and liquidity constraints 
as of december   we owned  common units of pvg and pvg owned  common units of pvr  all of which are unregistered and restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act of  or the securities act 
unless we or pvg were to register these units  we or pvg are limited to selling into the market in any three month period an amount of pvg common units or pvr common units that does not exceed the greater of of the total number of common units outstanding or the average weekly reported trading volume of the common units for the four calendar weeks prior to the sale 
in addition  pvg faces contractual limitations on its ability to sell its general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in pvr and the market for such interests is illiquid 
congress is considering proposed legislation that may  if enacted  negatively impact the value of our limited partner interests in pvg by precluding pvg from qualifying for treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules 
in response to recent public offerings of interests in the management operations of private equity funds and hedge funds  members of congress are considering substantive changes to the definition of qualifying income under section d internal revenue code and changing the characterization of certain types of income received from partnerships 
in particular  one proposal recharacterizes certain income and gain received with respect to investment service partnership interests as ordinary income for the performance of services  which may not be treated as qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships 
as such proposal is currently interpreted  a significant portion of pvg s interests in pvr may be viewed as an investment service partnership interest 
although we are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation  or any other proposals  will ultimately be enacted  the enactment of any such legislation could negatively impact the value of our limited partner interests in pvg 
risks related to pvr s coal and natural resource management business if pvr s lessees do not manage their operations well  their production volumes and pvr s coal royalties revenues could decrease 
pvr depends on its lessees to effectively manage their operations on its properties 
pvr s lessees make their own business decisions with respect to their operations  including decisions relating to 
table of contents the method of mining  credit review of their customers  marketing of the coal mined  coal transportation arrangements  negotiations with unions  employee hiring and firing  employee wages  benefits and other compensation  permitting  surety bonding  and mine closure and reclamation 
if pvr s lessees do not manage their operations well  their production could be reduced  which would result in lower coal royalties revenues to pvr and could adversely affect pvr s ability to make its quarterly distributions 
the coal mining operations of pvr s lessees are subject to numerous operational risks that could result in lower coal royalties revenues 
pvr s coal royalties revenues are largely dependent on the level of production from its coal reserves achieved by its lessees 
the level of pvr s lessees production is subject to operating conditions or events that may increase pvr s lessees cost of mining and delay or halt production at particular mines for varying lengths of time and that are beyond their or its control  including the inability to acquire necessary permits  changes or variations in geologic conditions  such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock embedded in or overlying the coal deposit  changes in governmental regulation of the coal industry  mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems  adverse claims to title or existing defects of title  interruptions due to power outages  adverse weather and natural disasters  such as heavy rains and flooding  labor related interruptions  employee injuries or fatalities  and fires and explosions 
any interruptions to the production of coal from pvr s reserves could reduce its coal royalties revenues and adversely affect its ability to make its quarterly distributions 
in addition  pvr s coal royalties revenues are based upon sales of coal by its lessees to their customers 
if pvr s lessees do not receive payments for delivered coal on a timely basis from their customers  their cash flow would be adversely affected  which could cause pvr s cash flow to be adversely affected and could adversely affect pvr s ability to make its quarterly distributions 
a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues and the value of pvr s coal reserves 
a substantial or extended decline in coal prices from recent levels could have a material adverse effect on pvr s lessees operations including mine closures and on the quantities of coal that may be economically produced from its properties 
this  in turn  could reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues  its coal services revenues and the value of its coal reserves 
additionally  volatility in coal prices could make it difficult to estimate with precision the value of pvr s coal reserves and any coal reserves that pvr may consider for acquisition 

table of contents pvr depends on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of its coal royalties revenues and the loss of or reduction in production from any of pvr s major lessees could reduce its coal royalties revenues 
pvr depends on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of its coal royalties revenues 
in  five primary operators  each with multiple leases  accounted for of pvr s coal royalties revenues and of our total consolidated revenues 
if any of these operators enters bankruptcy or decides to cease operations or significantly reduce its production  pvr s coal royalties revenues could be reduced 
a failure on the part of pvr s lessees to make coal royalty payments could give pvr the right to terminate the lease  repossess the property or obtain liquidation damages and or enforce payment obligations under the lease 
if pvr repossessed any of its properties  pvr would seek to find a replacement lessee 
pvr may not be able to find a replacement lessee and  if it finds a replacement lessee  pvr may not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time 
in addition  the outgoing lessee could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings that could further delay the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to another operator 
if pvr enters into a new lease  the replacement operator might not achieve the same levels of production or sell coal at the same price as the lessee it replaced 
in addition  it may be difficult for pvr to secure new or replacement lessees for small or isolated coal reserves  since industry trends toward consolidation favor larger scale  higher technology mining operations to increase productivity rates 
pvr s coal business will be adversely affected if pvr is unable to replace or increase its coal reserves through acquisitions 
because its reserves decline as its lessees mine its coal  pvr s future success and growth depends  in part  upon its ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable 
if pvr is unable to negotiate purchase contracts to replace or increase its coal reserves on acceptable terms  its coal royalties revenues will decline as its coal reserves are depleted 
in addition  if pvr is unable to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties it is able to acquire  its coal royalties revenues may decline and pvr could  therefore  experience a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
if pvr acquires additional coal reserves  there is a possibility that any acquisition could be dilutive to earnings and reduce its ability to make distributions to unitholders or to pay interest on  or the principal of  its debt obligations 
any debt pvr incurs to finance an acquisition may similarly affect its ability to make distributions to unitholders or to pay interest on  or the principal of  its debt obligations 
pvr s ability to make acquisitions in the future also could be limited by restrictions under its existing or future debt agreements  competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates 
pvr s lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with coal from properties other than pvr s  depriving pvr of the ability to receive amounts in excess of the minimum coal royalty payments 
pvr does not control its lessees business operations 
pvr s lessees customer supply contracts do not generally require its lessees to satisfy their obligations to their customers with coal mined from pvr s reserves 
several factors may influence a lessee s decision to supply its customers with coal mined from properties pvr does not own or lease  including the royalty rates under the lessee s lease with pvr  mining conditions  transportation costs and availability and customer coal quality specifications 
if a lessee satisfies its obligations to its customers with coal from properties pvr does not own or lease  production under its lease will decrease  and pvr will receive lower coal royalties revenues 
fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation could reduce the production of coal mined from pvr s properties 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for the customers of pvr s lessees 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make coal produced by some or all of pvr s lessees less competitive than coal produced from other sources 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition for pvr s lessees from coal producers in other parts of the country or increased imports from offshore producers 
pvr s lessees depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to deliver coal to their customers 
disruption of these transportation services due to weather related problems  strikes  lockouts  bottlenecks  mechanical failures and other events could temporarily impair the ability of pvr s lessees to supply coal to their customers 
pvr s lessees transportation providers may face difficulties in the future and impair the ability of its lessees to supply coal to their customers  thereby resulting in decreased coal royalties revenues to pvr 

table of contents pvr s lessees could experience labor disruptions  and pvr s lessees workforces could become increasingly unionized in the future 
two of pvr s lessees each has one mine operated by unionized employees 
one of the mines operated by unionized employees was pvr s second largest mine on the basis of coal production as of december  all of pvr s lessees could become increasingly unionized in the future 
if some or all of pvr s lessees non unionized operations were to become unionized  it could adversely affect their productivity and increase the risk of work stoppages 
in addition  pvr s lessees operations may be adversely affected by work stoppages at unionized companies  particularly if union workers were to orchestrate boycotts against its lessees operations 
any further unionization of pvr s lessees employees could adversely affect the stability of production from its coal reserves and reduce its coal royalties revenues 
pvr s coal reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate  which could materially adversely affect the quantities and value of pvr s coal reserves 
pvr s estimates of its coal reserves may vary substantially from the actual amounts of coal its lessees may be able to economically recover 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves  including many factors beyond pvr s control 
estimates of coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions  any one of which may  if incorrect  result in an estimate that varies considerably from actual results 
these factors and assumptions relate to geological and mining conditions  which may not be fully identified by available exploration data  the amount of ultimately recoverable coal in the ground  the effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and future coal prices  operating costs  capital expenditures  severance and excise taxes and development and reclamation costs 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to pvr s coal reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variations may be material 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on the coal reserve data provided by pvr 
any change in fuel consumption patterns by electric power generators away from the use of coal could affect the ability of pvr s lessees to sell the coal they produce and thereby reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues 
according to the us department of energy  domestic electric power generation accounts for approximately of domestic coal consumption 
the amount of coal consumed for domestic electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity  the price and availability of competing fuels for power plants such as nuclear  natural gas  fuel oil and hydroelectric power and environmental and other governmental regulations 
pvr believes that most new power plants will be built to produce electricity during peak periods of demand 
many of these new power plants will likely be fired by natural gas because of lower construction costs compared to coal fired plants and because natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel 
the increasingly stringent requirements of the caa may result in more electric power generators shifting from coal to natural gas fired power plants 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment air emissions 
extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generators could have corresponding effects on the ability of pvr s lessees to sell the coal they produce and thereby reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues 
federal  state and local laws and regulations extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides  mercury and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants  which are the ultimate consumers of the coal pvr s lessees produce 
these laws and regulations can require significant emission control expenditures for many coal fired power plants  and various new and proposed laws and regulations may require further emission reductions and associated emission control expenditures 
there is also continuing pressure on state and federal regulators to impose limits on carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants  particularly coal fired power plants 
as a result of these current and proposed laws  regulations and trends  electricity generators may elect to switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions  possibly further reducing demand for the coal that pvr s lessees produce and thereby reducing its coal royalties revenues 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment air emissions 

table of contents delays in pvr s lessees obtaining mining permits and approvals  or the inability to obtain required permits and approvals  could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
mine operators  including pvr s lessees  must obtain numerous permits and approvals that impose strict conditions and obligations relating to various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining 
the permitting rules are complex and can change over time 
the public has the right to comment on many permit applications and otherwise participate in the permitting process  including through court intervention 
accordingly  permits required by pvr s lessees to conduct operations may not be issued  maintained or renewed  may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements that restrict pvr s lessees ability to economically conduct their mining operations 
limitations on pvr s lessees ability to conduct their mining operations due to the inability to obtain or renew necessary permits  or due to uncertainty  litigation or delays associated with the eventual issuance of these permits  could have an adverse effect on its coal royalties revenues 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment mining permits and approvals 
uncertainty over the precise parameters of the clean water act s regulatory scope and a recent federal district court decision may adversely impact pvr s coal lessees ability to secure the necessary permits for their valley fill surface mining activities 
to dispose of mining overburden generated from surface mining activities  pvr s lessees often need to obtain government approvals  including clean water act section permits to construct valley fills and sediment control ponds 
ongoing uncertainty over which waters are subject to the clean water act may adversely impact pvr s lessees ability to secure these necessary permits 
in addition  a recent decision by a united states district court in west virginia invalidated a permit issued to one of pvr s lessees for the republic no 
mine and enjoined its lessee  alex energy  inc  from taking any further actions under this permit 
although this ruling has been appealed  uncertainty over the correct legal standard for issuing section permits may lead to rulings invalidating other permits  additional challenges to various permits and additional delays and costs in applying for and obtaining new permits 
unless this decision is overturned or further limited in subsequent proceedings  the ruling and its collateral consequences could ultimately have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment clean water act  for more information about the litigation described above 
pvr s lessees mining operations are subject to extensive and costly laws and regulations  which could increase operating costs and limit its lessees ability to produce coal  which could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
pvr s lessees are subject to numerous and detailed federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting coal mining operations  including laws and regulations pertaining to employee health and safety  permitting and licensing requirements  air quality standards  water pollution  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  the discharge of materials into the environment  surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations 
pvr s lessees are required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment 
the costs  liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be significant and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
the possibility exists that new laws or regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially affect pvr s lessees mining operations  either through direct impacts such as new requirements impacting its lessees existing mining operations  or indirect impacts such as new laws and regulations that discourage or limit coal consumers use of coal 
any of these direct or indirect impacts could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
see item  business government regulation and environmental mattes pvr coal and natural resource management segment 
because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry and  notwithstanding compliance efforts  pvr does not believe violations by its lessees can be eliminated completely 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and  to a lesser extent  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 
pvr s lessees may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from their operations 
if pvr s lessees are required to pay these costs and liabilities and if their financial viability is affected by doing so  then their mining operations and  as a result  pvr s coal royalties revenues and its ability to make distributions  could be adversely affected 
recent mining accidents in west virginia and kentucky have received national attention and instigated responses at the state and national level that have resulted in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at all mining 
table of contents operations  particularly underground mining operations 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment mine health and safety laws  for a more detailed discussion of recently enacted legislation that addresses mine safety equipment  training and emergency reporting requirements 
implementing and complying with these new laws and regulations could adversely affect pvr s lessees coal production and could therefore have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues and its ability to make distributions 
risks related to pvr s natural gas midstream business the success of pvr s natural gas midstream business depends upon its ability to find and contract for new sources of natural gas supply 
in order to maintain or increase system throughput levels on pvr s gathering systems and asset utilization rates at its processing plants  pvr must contract for new natural gas supplies 
the primary factors affecting pvr s ability to connect new supplies of natural gas to its gathering systems include the level of drilling activity creating new gas supply near its gathering systems  pvr s success in contracting for existing natural gas supplies that are not committed to other systems and pvr s ability to expand and increase the capacity of its systems 
pvr may not be able to obtain additional contracts for natural gas supplies 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
pvr has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operations  the amount of reserves underlying the wells and the rate at which production from a well will decline 
in addition  pvr has no control over producers or their production decisions  which are affected by  among other things  prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital 
pvr s natural gas midstream assets  including its gathering systems and processing plants  are connected to natural gas reserves and wells for which the production will naturally decline over time 
pvr s cash flows associated with these systems will decline unless it is able to secure new supplies of natural gas by connecting additional production to these systems 
a material decrease in natural gas production in pvr s areas of operation  as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise  would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas pvr handles  which would reduce its revenues and operating income 
in addition  pvr s future growth will depend  in part  upon whether it can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in pvr s currently connected supplies 
the profitability of pvr s natural gas midstream business is dependent upon prices and market demand for natural gas and ngls  which are beyond pvr s control and have been volatile 
pvr is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices 
during  pvr generated a majority of its gross processing margin from two types of contractual arrangements under which its margin is exposed to increases and decreases in the price of natural gas and ngls percentage of proceeds and gas purchase keep whole arrangements 
see item  business contracts pvr natural gas midstream segment 
virtually all of the natural gas gathered on pvr s crescent system and hamlin system is contracted under percentage of proceeds arrangements 
the natural gas gathered on pvr s beaver system is contracted primarily under either percentage of proceeds or gas purchase keep whole arrangements 
under both types of arrangements  pvr provides gathering and processing services for natural gas received 
under percentage of proceeds arrangements  pvr generally sells the ngls produced from the processing operations and the remaining residue gas at market prices and remits to the producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based upon an index price for the gas and the price received for the ngls 
under these arrangements  revenues and gross margins decline when natural gas prices and ngl prices decrease 
accordingly  a decrease in the price of natural gas or ngls could have a material adverse effect on pvr s results of operations 
under gas purchase keep whole arrangements  pvr generally buys natural gas from producers based upon an index price and then sells the ngls and the remaining residue gas to third parties at market prices 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas during processing reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale  profitability is dependent on the value of those ngls being higher than the value of the volume of gas reduction or shrink 
under these arrangements  revenues and gross margins decrease when the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
accordingly  a change in the relationship between the price of natural gas and the price of ngls could have a material adverse effect on pvr s results of operations 

table of contents in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile  and pvr expects this volatility to continue 
the markets and prices for residue gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond pvr s control 
these factors include demand for oil  natural gas and ngls  which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions  and other factors  including the impact of weather on the demand for oil and natural gas  the level of domestic oil and natural gas production  the availability of imported oil and natural gas  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations  the availability of local  intrastate and interstate transportation systems  the availability and marketing of competitive fuels  the impact of energy conservation efforts  and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation 
acquisitions and expansions may affect pvr s business by substantially increasing the level of its indebtedness and contingent liabilities and increasing the risks of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations 
from time to time  pvr evaluates and acquires assets and businesses that it believes complement its existing operations 
pvr may encounter difficulties integrating these acquisitions with its existing businesses without a loss of employees or customers  a loss of revenues  an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties 
in addition  pvr may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies  competitive advantages  cost savings or other benefits expected from these acquisitions 
future acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
as a result  pvr s capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition 
future acquisitions might not generate increases in pvr s cash distributions to its unitholders 
expanding pvr s natural gas midstream business by constructing new gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities subjects pvr to construction risks 
one of the ways pvr may grow its natural gas midstream business is through the construction of additions to existing gathering  compression and processing systems 
the construction of a new gathering system or pipeline  the expansion of an existing pipeline through the addition of new pipe or compression and the construction of new processing facilities involve numerous regulatory  environmental  political and legal uncertainties beyond pvr s control and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital 
if pvr undertakes these projects  they may not be completed on schedule  or at all  or at the budgeted cost 
moreover  pvr s revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for example  the construction of gathering facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital  which may exceed pvr s estimates 
generally  pvr may have only limited natural gas supplies committed to these facilities prior to their construction 
moreover  pvr may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize 
as a result  there is the risk that new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas to achieve pvr s expected investment return  which could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations and its ability to make distributions to us 
if pvr is unable to obtain new rights of way or the cost of renewing existing rights of way increases  then pvr may be unable to fully execute its growth strategy and its cash flows could be reduced 
the construction of additions to pvr s existing gathering assets may require pvr to obtain new rights of way before constructing new pipelines 
pvr may be unable to obtain rights of way to connect new natural gas supplies to its existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities 
additionally  it may become more expensive for pvr to obtain new rights of way or to renew existing rights of way 
if the cost of obtaining new rights of way or renewing existing rights of way increases  then pvr s cash flows could be reduced 
pvr is exposed to the credit risk of its natural gas midstream customers  and nonpayment or nonperformance by pvr s customers would reduce its cash flows 
pvr is subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its natural gas midstream customers 
pvr depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its natural gas midstream revenues 
in  three of pvr s natural gas midstream customers accounted for of pvr s natural gas midstream revenues and of our total 
table of contents consolidated revenues 
any nonpayment or nonperformance by pvr s natural gas midstream customers would reduce its cash flows 
any reduction in the capacity of  or the allocations to  pvr in interconnecting third party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes processed  which could adversely affect pvr s revenues and cash flows 
pvr is dependent upon connections to third party pipelines to receive and deliver residue gas and ngls 
any reduction of capacities of these interconnecting pipelines due to testing  line repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced volumes gathered and processed in pvr s natural gas midstream facilities 
similarly  if additional shippers begin transporting volumes of residue gas and ngls on interconnecting pipelines  pvr s allocations in these pipelines could be reduced 
any reduction in volumes gathered and processed in pvr s facilities could adversely affect its revenues and cash flows 
natural gas derivative transactions may limit pvr s potential gains and involve other risks 
in order to manage pvr s exposure to price risks in the marketing of its natural gas and ngls  pvr periodically enters into natural gas and ngl price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of its expected production 
pvr s hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of two years or less 
however  in connection with acquisitions  sometimes pvr s hedges are for longer periods 
these hedging transactions may limit pvr s potential gains if natural gas or ngl prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements 
in trying to maintain an appropriate balance  pvr may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how natural gas or ngl prices fluctuate in the future 
in addition  derivative transactions may expose pvr to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which pvr s production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for pvr s production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to pvr s futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts natural gas or ngl prices 
in addition  derivative instruments involve basis risk 
basis risk in a derivative contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
for example  a nymex index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production 
pvr s natural gas midstream business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be fully covered by insurance 
pvr s natural gas midstream operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering  compression  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and ngls  including damage to pipelines  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes  tornadoes  floods  fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism  inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leaks of natural gas  ngls and other hydrocarbons  and fires and explosions 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of pvr s related operations 
pvr s natural gas midstream operations are concentrated in texas and oklahoma  and a natural disaster or other hazard affecting these areas could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
pvr is not fully insured against all risks incident to its natural gas midstream business 
pvr does not have property insurance on all of its underground pipeline systems that would cover damage to the pipelines 
pvr is not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur  other than those considered to be sudden and accidental 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect pvr s operations and financial condition 
federal  state or local regulatory measures could adversely affect pvr s natural gas midstream business 
pvr owns and operates an mile interstate natural gas pipeline that  pursuant to the nga  is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc 
the ferc has granted pvr waivers of various requirements otherwise applicable to conventional ferc jurisdictional pipelines  including the obligation to file a tariff governing rates  terms and conditions of open access transportation service 
the ferc has determined that pvr will have to comply with the filing requirements if the natural gas company ever desires to apply for blanket transportation authority to transport third party gas on the mile pipeline 
the ferc may revoke these waivers at any time 
pvr s natural gas gathering facilities generally are exempt from the ferc s jurisdiction under the nga  but the ferc regulation nevertheless could change and significantly affect pvr s gathering business and the market for its services 
for a more detailed discussion of how regulatory measures affect pvr s natural gas gathering systems  see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr natural gas midstream segment 
failure to comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal remedies 
pvr s natural gas midstream business is subject to extensive environmental regulation 
many of the operations and activities of pvr s gathering systems  plants and other facilities are subject to significant federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these include  for example  laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions and discharge of wastes from pvr s facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by pvr or the prior owners of its natural 
table of contents gas midstream business or locations to which it or they have sent wastes for disposal 
these laws and regulations can restrict or impact pvr s business activities in many ways  including restricting the manner in which it disposes of substances  requiring pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions  requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination  and requiring capital expenditures to comply with control requirements 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations 
certain environmental statutes impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances and wastes have been disposed or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of substances or wastes into the environment 
there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in pvr s natural gas midstream business due to its handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions related to its natural gas midstream operations  historical industry operations  waste disposal practices and the use by the prior owners of its natural gas midstream business of natural gas flow meters containing mercury 
for example  an accidental release from one of pvr s pipelines or processing facilities could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup  restoration costs and natural resource damages  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase pvr s compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
pvr may incur material environmental costs and liabilities 
insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made

in accordance with the sec s guidelines  the engineers estimates of future net revenues from our properties and the standardized measure thereof are based on oil and natural gas sales prices in effect as of december   and estimated future costs as of december  the prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations 
prices for oil and gas are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations as well as fluctuations resulting from numerous other factors 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the standardized measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
the information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions of certain volumetric reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of a decrease or increase in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in production prices

coal reserves and production as of december   pvr owned or controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves located on approximately  acres including fee and leased acreage in illinois  kentucky  new mexico  virginia and west virginia 
pvr s coal reserves are in various surface and underground mine seams located on the following properties central appalachia basin properties located in eastern kentucky  southwestern virginia and southern west virginia  northern appalachia basin properties located in northern west virginia  illinois basin properties located in southern illinois and western kentucky  and san juan basin properties located in the four corners area of new mexico 
coal reserves are coal tons that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination considering legal  economic and technical limitations 
all of the estimates of pvr s coal reserves are classified as proven and probable reserves 
proven and probable reserves are defined as follows proven coal reserves 
proven coal reserves are coal reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  ii grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and iii the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely  and the geologic character is so well defined  that the size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable coal reserves 
probable coal reserves are coal reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven coal reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are more widely spaced or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven coal reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in areas where geologic conditions indicate potential inconsistencies related to coal reserves  pvr performs additional exploration to ensure the continuity and mineability of the coal reserves 
consequently  sampling in those areas involves drill holes or channel samples that are spaced closer together than those distances cited above 
coal reserve estimates are adjusted annually for production  unmineable areas  acquisitions and sales of coal in place 
the majority of pvr s coal reserves are high in energy content  low in sulfur and suitable for either the steam or metallurgical market 
the amount of coal that a lessee can profitably mine at any given time is subject to several factors and may be substantially different from proven and probable coal reserves 
included among the factors that influence profitability are the existing market price  coal quality and operating costs
