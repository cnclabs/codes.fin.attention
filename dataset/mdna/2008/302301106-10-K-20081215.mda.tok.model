in our pawnshops  we acquire inventory for retail sales through pawn loan forfeitures and  to a lesser extent  through purchases of customers merchandise 
the gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the loan or purchase value at the time the property is either accepted as loan collateral or purchased 
improper value assessment in the lending or purchasing process can result in lower margins or reduced marketability of the merchandise 
at september   of our ezmoney stores and of our domestic pawn stores offered credit services to customers seeking loans from unaffiliated lenders 
we do not participate in any of the loans made by the lenders  but earn a fee for helping customers obtain credit and for enhancing customers creditworthiness by providing letters of credit 
we also offer a free service to all credit service customers to improve or establish their credit histories by reporting their payments to an external credit reporting agency 
in connection with our credit services  the unaffiliated lenders offer customers two types of loans 
in all ezmoney stores and domestic pawn stores offering credit services  customers can obtain short term loans  with principal amounts up to  but averaging approximately terms of these short term loans are generally less than days  averaging about days  with due dates corresponding with the customers next payday

the total purchase price may increase upon the payment of contingent consideration depending on the price at which the sellers sell the ezcorp shares they will acquire as part of the merger consideration 
this acquisition is described more fully below under acquisitions pending at september  in fiscal  the ezpawn u 
s operations segment contributed million greater store operating income compared to the prior year  primarily from a million increase in gross profit on sales and a million increase in pawn service charges  partially offset by higher operating costs 
empe o f cil contributed million of store operating income compared to a small loss in the prior year 
our ezmoney operations segment contributed million greater store operating income  comprised of higher fees net of bad debt  somewhat offset by higher operating costs at new and existing stores 
after an million increase in administrative expenses  a million increase in depreciation and amortization and a million loss on the sale disposal of assets compared to a small gain in fiscal  operating income increased million to million 
after a million decrease in net interest income  a million increase in our equity interest in the income of albemarle bond  and a million increase in income taxes and other smaller items  our consolidated net income improved to million in the current year from million in the prior year 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for losses on signature loans  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  observable trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we use this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
you should refer to note a of our consolidated financial statements for a more 
table of contents complete review of other accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan and sales revenue recognition we record pawn service charges using the interest method for all pawn loans we believe to be collectible 
we base our estimate of collectible loans on several factors  including recent redemption rates  historical trends in redemption rates and the amount of loans due in the following two to three months 
unexpected variations in any of these factors could change our estimate of collectible loans  affecting our earnings and financial condition 
if a pawn loan is not repaid  we value the forfeited collateral inventory at the lower of cost pawn loan principal or market net realizable value of the property 
we record sales revenue and the related cost when this inventory is sold 
credit service revenue recognition we earn credit service fees when we assist customers in obtaining loans from unaffiliated lenders 
we initially defer recognition of the fees we expect to collect  net of direct expenses  and recognize that deferred net amount over the life of the related loans 
we reserve the percentage of credit service fees we expect not to collect 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce credit service fee revenue upon loan default  and increase credit service fee revenue upon collection 
credit service revenue is included in signature loan fees on our statements of operations 
credit service bad debt we issue letters of credit to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the letters of credit assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed it by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fee 
although amounts paid under letters of credit may be collected later  we charge those amounts to signature loan bad debt upon default 
we record recoveries under the letters of credit as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
after attempting collection of bad debts internally  we occasionally sell them to an unaffiliated company as another method of recovery 
we account for the sale of defaulted accounts in the same manner as internal collections of defaulted accounts 
the majority of our credit service customers obtain short term loans with a single maturity date 
these short term loans  with maturity dates averaging about days  are considered defaulted if they have not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
other credit service customers obtain installment loans with a series of payments due over as much as a five month period 
if one payment of an installment loan is delinquent  that one payment is considered defaulted 
if more than one installment payment is delinquent at any time  the entire loan is considered defaulted 
credit service allowance for losses we also provide an allowance for losses we expect to incur under letters of credit for loans that have not yet matured 
the allowance is based on recent loan default experience adjusted for seasonal variations 
it includes all amounts we expect to pay to the unaffiliated lenders upon loan default  including loan principal  accrued interest and insufficient funds fees  net of the amounts we expect to collect from borrowers expected loc losses 
changes in the allowance are charged to signature loan bad debt expense 
we include the balance of expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest and insufficient funds fees 
based on the expected loss and collection percentages  we also provide an allowance for the credit service fees we expect not to collect  and charge changes in this allowance to signature loan fee revenue 
the accuracy of our allowance estimates is dependent upon several factors  including our ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  in response to regulatory changes or for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
we believe we effectively manage these risks through our underwriting criteria and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 

table of contents payday loan revenue recognition we accrue fees in accordance with state laws on the percentage of payday loans we believe to be collectible 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce fee revenue upon loan default  and increase fee revenue upon collection 
payday loan fee revenue is included in signature loan fees on our statements of operations 
loan terms are generally less than days  averaging about days 
payday loan bad debt we consider a loan defaulted if it has not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
although defaulted loans may be collected later  we charge the loan principal to signature loan bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
we record collections of principal as a reduction of signature loan bad debt when collected 
after attempting collection of bad debts internally  we occasionally sell them to an unaffiliated company as another method of recovery 
we account for the sale of defaulted accounts in the same manner as internal collections of defaulted accounts 
payday loan allowance for losses we also provide an allowance for losses on payday loans that have not yet matured and related fees receivable  based on recent loan default experience adjusted for seasonal variations 
we charge any changes in the principal valuation allowance to signature loan bad debt 
we record changes in the fee receivable valuation allowance to signature loan fee revenue 
at september   the combined allowances for uncollectible principal and interest on payday loans were million 
inventory if a pawn loan is not redeemed  we record the forfeited collateral at cost 
we do not record loan loss allowances or charge offs on the principal portion of pawn loans  as they are fully collateralized 
in order to state inventory at the lower of cost specific identification or market net realizable value  we record an allowance for shrinkage and excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory 
the allowance is based on the type and age of merchandise and recent sales trends and margins 
at september   the inventory valuation allowance was million  or of gross inventory 
we record changes in the inventory valuation allowance as cost of goods sold 
the accuracy of our inventory allowance is dependent on our ability to predict future events based on historical trends 
unexpected variations in sales margins  inventory turnover  or other factors  including fluctuations in gold values could increase or decrease our inventory allowance 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax liability and assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include in our balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we determined we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to the income tax provision in that period 
likewise  if we determined we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  a decrease to the valuation allowance would decrease the tax provision in that period 
we assess the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance quarterly 
our valuation allowance was million at september   compared to million at september  as a result of a taxable gain on the sale of property  we reduced the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the utilization of a capital loss carry forward that was previously reserved 
effective october   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
see note j  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and related disclosures 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we estimate the grant date fair value of options using the black scholes merton option pricing model and amortize that fair value to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the options vesting periods 
certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

table of contents acquisitions pending at september  on november   we acquired the operating assets of eleven pawnshops located in las vegas  north las vegas and henderson  nevada that operate under the pawn plus  pawn place and asap pawn brands for approximately million 
million of the purchase price was paid through the issuance of  shares of our class a non voting common stock  and the remaining million was paid in cash 
on september   we agreed to acquire through a merger all of the capital stock of value financial services  inc vfs 
in the merger  we will acquire vfs s pawn stores  most of which are in florida 
the total purchase price may increase upon the payment of contingent consideration  as described below  depending on the price at which the sellers sell the ezcorp shares they will acquire as part of the merger consideration 
as merger consideration  each vfs shareholder may choose to receive either shares of ezcorp class a non voting common stock the ezcorp shares  rounded up to the nearest whole ezcorp share  or cash for each share of vfs common stock owned by such shareholder at the effective time of the merger 
the cash consideration is limited to or less of the vfs common stock 
assuming the exercise of all options  warrants or other conversion rights  we expect to acquire  shares of vfs common stock in the merger 
ezcorp agreed to provide vfs shareholders some price protections if they sell their ezcorp shares received in the merger within days after the closing of the merger 
pursuant to this  ezcorp will pay a selling shareholder the difference between per share and the gross price per share the selling shareholder actually receives  if less than per share  up to a maximum of per share 
as an inducement to enter the merger agreement  ezcorp has also agreed to provide vfs shareholders who decide to sell their ezcorp shares within days after the closing of the merger a premium for sales of their ezcorp shares for more than per share 
for vfs shareholders who sell their ezcorp shares for more than per share and  after a five day waiting period to facilitate share distribution  within the first day period from the date of the closing of the merger  ezcorp will pay per share  second day period from the date of the closing of the merger  per share  third day period from the date of the closing of the merger  per share  and fourth day period from the date of the closing of the merger  per share 
we are currently unable to estimate the amount of contingent consideration that will be paid under the provisions described in this paragraph 
excluding the contingent consideration that is not currently known  we estimate the total vfs acquisition price to be approximately million  plus the assumption of vfs outstanding debt of approximately million  for an aggregate value of approximately million 
the ultimate total purchase price will vary from this amount based on the value of ezcorp s stock  the amount of vfs shareholders electing to receive cash in lieu of ezcorp shares  and any contingent consideration that will become payable  up to a maximum possible contingent payment of million 
we anticipate completing the vfs acquisition on december  results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion compares our results of operations for the current year ended september  to the prior year ended september  it should be read with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
included in the fiscal results is the impact of hurricane ike  which made landfall near houston  texas on september  in september  the company lost approximately  store days due to the hurricane and the resulting power outages 
we estimate this reduced our fiscal pre tax income by approximately million 
in the ezpawn us operations segment  we estimate the hurricane reduced sales gross profit million  reduced pawn service charges million  and 
table of contents increased operating expenses million 
in the ezmoney operations segment  we estimate the hurricane reduced signature loan fee revenues million and increased signature loan bad debt million

our current year pawn service charge revenue increased  or million from the prior year to million 
this was due to a three percentage point increase in loan yields to  coupled with a higher average pawn loan balance 
same store pawn service charges increased from the prior year  with the remaining increase coming from acquired stores 
we estimate temporary store closures from hurricane ike in september  discussed above  reduced pawn service charges approximately million 
in the last two years  we have periodically raised our loan values on gold jewelry in response to increases in gold market values and similar changes by our competitors 
this contributed about million to the increase in pawn service charges in the current year 
in the current year  million of recorded pawn service charge revenue was collected in cash  and million was due to an increase in pawn service charges receivable related to the larger ending portfolio in the current year

we estimate temporary store closures from hurricane ike in september reduced the gross profit on merchandise sales approximately million 
the gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales increased million from the prior year to million 
this was due to a million  or increase in jewelry scrapping sales on more volume  and a percentage point increase in margins 
the jewelry scrapping sales include the current year sale of approximately million of loose diamonds removed from scrapped jewelry  compared to approximately million in fiscal the proceeds refiners pay us for jewelry has increased in the last year in response to higher gold values 
we also increased the amount we loan on jewelry and pay to purchase jewelry from customers  increasing the cost of these items 
we estimate these factors had a million positive net effect on the gross profit from jewelry scrapping sales

the segment s signature loan contribution  or fees less bad debt  increased million  or compared to fiscal the primary driver of the increased contribution is the addition of new stores  resulting in a increase in the current year signature loan fee revenue 
signature loan bad debt increased million to of related fees in the current year compared to in the prior year 
we believe the effects of the economic stimulus checks distributed may through july dampened demand for new loans during the period but benefited bad debt 
we estimate that power outages resulting from hurricane ike  which caused temporary closures in ezmoney stores in the houston  texas area in september  as discussed above  reduced signature loan fee revenues approximately million and increased bad debt approximately million  or of fee revenues for the year 
for the past several years  we also have sold our bad debt  on a weekly basis  to third parties after days of internal collection efforts  but market rates for debt sales have declined over the last two years 
beginning in the march quarter  we now continue to attempt collection of our bad debt past days and are employing a combination of in house collections and third party debt sales and are testing several new ancillary collection techniques 
operations expense increased million in the current year to million  or of segment revenues from in the prior year 
the increase was mostly from additional labor  rent and other costs

approximately million was recorded as a reduction of fee revenue  and million was recorded as bad debt in the current year based on the increase in loans that were not collected as a result of these store closures 
in the current year  the million increase in signature loan fees net of bad debt and million greater operations expense resulted in a million net increase in store operating income from the ezmoney operations segment 
for the current year  ezmoney operations comprised of consolidated store operating income compared to in fiscal  as operating income from the ezpawn us operations and empe o f cil segments grew at a faster pace 
other items the items discussed below affect our consolidated financial results  but are not allocated between segments 
administrative expenses in the current year were million compared to million in the prior year 
administrative expenses increased to from in the prior year  when measured as a percentage of net revenue 
the dollar increase was due primarily to a million increase in administrative labor and benefits  a million increase in professional fees services  a million increase in travel and transportation expenses and a million settlement of a lawsuit from the texas attorney general as more fully described in note o to the attached consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in the current year  compared to million in the prior year 
depreciation on assets placed in service  primarily related to new ezmoney and empe o f cil stores and acquired us pawn stores exceeded the reduction from assets that became fully depreciated or were retired 
we earned million of interest income on our invested cash in the current year for a rate of return of 
in fiscal  we earned million of interest income on our invested cash  yielding a rate of return 
with no debt in the current year  our million interest expense represents primarily the amortization of deferred financing costs  the commitment fee on our existing million line of credit  and an incremental ticking fee on our new million credit facility that will become effective upon the closing of the value financial services acquisition 
with no debt  interest expense of million in the prior year represented primarily the amortization of deferred financing costs 
our equity in the net income of albemarle and bond plc increased million from fiscal to million in the current year primarily as a result of a b s higher earnings from same stores and from a b s acquisition of a competitor in july the fiscal income tax expense was million of pretax income compared to million of pretax income for the prior year 
in the current year  we recognized the benefit of a previously under utilized foreign tax credit related to our investment in albemarle and bond holdings plc by electing to use the gross method rather than the net method in claiming this credit on our us federal taxes 
this resulted in a million reduction in income tax expense compared to what would have been recognized under the net method 
of the million total  million relates to a reduction of taxes related to a b s current year earnings and million results from our ability to claim the larger credit by making the same election on amended prior year tax returns and by applying the same 
table of contents approach to a b s undistributed earnings from prior years 
in the current year  we also generated a capital gain resulting in the reversal of million from the valuation allowance previously placed on a capital loss carry forward 
in the fourth quarter  we also recorded a million additional tax charge related to an uncertain tax position in accordance with financial interpretation no 
the net effect of the above items caused the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal in the first three quarters of fiscal  we also estimated we would not qualify as a retail company under the texas margins tax based on the composition of our revenues  which would have doubled the applicable texas tax rate compared to fiscal  and accrued our taxes through the first three quarters of the year at the expected higher rate 
in the fourth quarter  we determined we qualify as a retail company in texas and lowered the applicable state tax rate in our accrued taxes 
this resulted in no change in tax rates between years but only in the estimated tax rates between quarters in fiscal taking into account all the above factors and our expectations for the next year  we estimate our effective tax rate in the year ending september  will be approximately 
consolidated operating income for the current year improved million over the prior year to million 
contributing to this were the million  million and million increases in store operating income in our ezpawn us  empe o f cil and ezmoney operations segments  partially offset by the million increase in administrative expenses  million increase in depreciation and amortization  and a million loss on sale disposal of assets compared to a small gain in fiscal after a million increase in our equity interest in the earnings of albemarle and bond  a million decrease in net interest income  and a million increase in income taxes and other smaller items  net income improved to million in fiscal from million in fiscal

in the last two years  we have periodically raised our loan values on gold jewelry in response to increases in gold market values and similar changes by our competitors 
this contributed about million to the increase in pawn service charges in the current year 
the higher yield resulted largely from the fiscal mid year conversion of most of our pawn stores from offering day loan terms to offering day terms

in the prior year  million of recorded pawn service charge revenue was collected in cash  offset by a million decrease in pawn service charges receivable 
the decrease in the prior year 
table of contents accrual was primarily due to shortening the loan term in most of our pawn stores in that period

in fiscal  we benefited from the doubling of loan forfeitures due to the reduction of loan terms in the majority of our stores 
this provided a greater amount of fresh inventory in the second and third quarters of fiscal to fuel sales at a better margin 
more aggressive discounting of electronics and jewelry and increased jewelry loan values in response to market increases in gold values also led to lower margins in fiscal the gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales increased million from fiscal to million 
this was due to an million  or increase in jewelry scrapping sales on more volume  and a percentage point decrease in margins 
the jewelry scrapping sales include the sale of approximately million of loose diamonds removed from scrapped jewelry in fiscal  compared to approximately million in fiscal the proceeds refiners pay us for jewelry has increased in the last year in response to higher gold values

the result was stronger than normal loan growth as well as a higher level of bad debt

as a result  our bad debt improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter  but was approximately percentage points higher as a percentage of related fees than the fourth quarter of fiscal operations expense increased million in fiscal to million  or of segment revenues from in the prior year

this amount includes principal  interest and insufficient funds fees 
in addition to the operating lease obligations in the table above  we are responsible for the maintenance  property taxes  and insurance at most of our locations 
in the fiscal year ended september   these collectively amounted to million 
in the fiscal year ending september   we plan to open to new signature loan stores in the us and to empe o f cil pawn stores in mexico for an expected capital expenditure of approximately million  plus the funding of working capital and start up losses at these stores 
we believe these new stores will create a drag on earnings and liquidity in their first six to nine months of operations before turning profitable 
while we had no debt outstanding at september   we have a million revolving credit facility secured by our assets  which matures october  under the terms of the agreement  we could borrow the full million at september  terms of the agreement require  among other things  that we meet certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants at september  payment of dividends and additional debt are allowed but restricted 
the interest amount shown in the table above reflects the commitment fee we anticipate paying through the maturity of the credit agreement  combined with the incremental commitment fee on our million fifth amended and restated credit agreement  discussed below  assuming we remain debt free 
on november   we acquired the operating assets of eleven pawnshops located in las vegas  north las vegas and henderson  nevada that operate under the pawn plus  pawn place and asap pawn brands for approximately million 
million of the purchase price was paid through the issuance of  shares of our class a non voting common stock  and the remaining million was paid in cash 
on september   we announced our agreement to acquire  for a combination of stock and cash consideration  of the equity ownership of value financial services  inc vfs for approximately million  plus the assumption of vfs outstanding debt of approximately million  for an aggregate value of approximately million 
if the vfs acquisition is completed  our cash on hand and availability under our current credit facility may not be adequate to fund the acquisition and other operating and growth cash needs 
we have executed a million fifth amended and restated credit agreement with the two banks in our current million fourth amended and restated credit agreement and three additional banks 
the agreement and the related loan documents were placed in escrow pending the closing of the merger agreement with vfs 
effectiveness of the new credit agreement is contingent upon the closing of the merger agreement with vfs by december   but bears a ticking fee of through december   regardless of whether it becomes effective by 
table of contents that date 
this ticking fee is included in the interest on long term debt obligations line of the contractual obligations table above 
if the merger agreement with vfs is closed on or before december   the new credit agreement will provide for  among other things  i an million revolving credit facility that ezcorp may request to be increased to a total of million and ii a million term loan 
if the agreement becomes effective  it will extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to three years from the closing of the merger agreement with vfs 
the maturity date of the term loan will be four years from the closing of the merger agreement with vfs 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  cash on hand  and availability under our existing revolving credit facility if the vfs acquisition is not completed by december  or our new credit facility if the vfs acquisition is completed by december  will be adequate to fund our contractual obligations  planned store growth  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and planned acquisition during the coming year 
off balance sheet arrangements we issue letters of credit to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the letters of credit assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed them by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fee 
we do not record on our balance sheet the loans related to our credit services as the loans are made by unaffiliated lenders 
we do not consolidate the unaffiliated lender s results with our results as we do not have any ownership interest in the lenders  do not exercise control over them and do not otherwise meet the criteria for consolidation as prescribed by fasb financial interpretation no 
regarding variable interest entities 
we include an allowance for expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest and insufficient funds fees 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality historically  pawn service charges are highest in our fourth fiscal quarter july through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season  jewelry sales surrounding valentine s day and the impact of tax refunds in the united states 
jewelry scrapping sales are heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory 
jewelry scrapping sales generally are greatest during our fourth fiscal quarter july through september due to relatively low jewelry merchandise sales in that quarter 
signature loan fees are generally highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters april through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
signature loan bad debt  both in dollar terms and as a percentage of related fees  is highest in the third and fourth quarters and lowest in the second quarter due primarily to the impact of tax refunds 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are strongest in the fourth fiscal quarter and weakest in the third fiscal quarter 
our cash flow typically is greatest in the second fiscal quarter due to a high level of loan redemptions and sales in the income tax refund season
