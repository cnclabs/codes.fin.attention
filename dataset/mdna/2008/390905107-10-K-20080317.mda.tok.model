the company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   under the section titled item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
judgments and assumptions used by management in the past have resulted in an overall allowance for loan losses that has been sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in these financial statements  management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
in addition  the company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management s best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets 
while the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties  the amount that the company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially in the near term from the carrying value reflected in these financial statements  resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in the year ended december   the company s net loans increased million  or 
as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  and because of the competition we face  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in prior years 
if economic conditions do not deteriorate  we believe that we are well positioned to continue to originate a substantial amount of loans in our southwest missouri market as well as our loan production markets of st 
louis  kansas city  central missouri and northwest arkansas 
in addition  we may consider other markets in which to establish loan production offices 
in the year ended december   the disbursed portion of residential and commercial construction loan balances increased million 
based upon the current lending environment and economic conditions  growth in our loan portfolio may be limited in to an amount that could be below our average of over the last five years 
in addition  the level of non performing loans and foreclosed assets may affect our net interest income and net income 
while the company has not historically had an overall high level of charge offs on non performing loans  the company does not accrue interest income on these loans and does not recognize interest income until the loan is repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loan 
generally  the higher the level of non performing assets  the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income 
loan growth continued in our loan production offices lpo 
many of these loans originated by our lpos are construction loans where the customer has yet to draw the full line 
in the year ended december   the overland park  kansas lpo originated loans totaling million with outstanding loan balances of million at december  in the year ended december   the rogers  arkansas lpo originated loans totaling million with outstanding loan balances of million at december  in the year ended december   the st 
louis lpo originated loans totaling million with outstanding loan balances of million at december  the columbia lpo  which began operating in march and serves the columbia  jefferson city  and lake of the ozarks  mo  region  originated million of loans with outstanding loan balances of million at december  the company attracts deposit accounts through the bank s retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services areas  and brokered deposits 
the company then utilizes these deposit funds  along with fhlbank advances and other borrowings  to meet loan demand 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million 
of this total increase  interest bearing transaction accounts increased million and retail certificates of deposit increased million 
partially offsetting the increases in these deposit categories  non interest bearing checking accounts decreased million 
as the generation of increased net interest income is critical to the growth of great southern s earnings  the continued ability to attract deposits or generate other funding sources is very important to successful loan growth 
there is a high level of competition for deposits in our markets 
while it is our goal to gain checking account and certificate of deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 
during the year ended december   our interest bearing checking account balances have continued to increase  however  our non interest bearing checking account balances have decreased in this same time period 
non interest bearing checking accounts have decreased primarily as a result of lower balances being kept in correspondent bank customers accounts 
these lower balances are due to the effects of the correspondent customers clearing checks through other avenues using electronic presentment  thus requiring lower compensating balances 
if this decrease in non interest bearing checking account balances continues  it could negatively impact our net interest income 
in the year ended december   brokered deposit balances decreased million 
as these balances matured  we elected to replace these funds with the retail deposits noted here and supplemented this with additional fhlbank advances 
our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and fhlbank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund these loans 
these funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by market interest rate changes 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts 
we also have a large portion of our liabilities that will reprice with changes to the federal funds rate or the three month libor rate 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
while we currently believe that neither increases nor decreases in market interest rates will materially adversely impact our net interest income  circumstances could change which may alter that outlook 
ongoing changes in the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve pose challenges for interest rate risk management 
beginning in the second half of and through september   the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb increased short term interest rates through steady increases to the federal funds rate 
other short term rates  such as libor and short term us treasury rates  increased in conjunction with these increases by the frb 
by september   the frb had raised the federal funds rates by from in june and other short term rates rose by corresponding amounts 
however  there was not a parallel shift in the yield curve  intermediate and long term interest rates did not increase at a corresponding pace 
this caused the shape of the interest rate yield curve to become much flatter  which creates different issues for interest rate risk management 
on september   the frb decreased the federal funds rate by basis points and many market interest rates began to fall in the following weeks 
in the months following september  the frb has reduced the federal funds rate by an additional basis points 
the federal funds rate now stands at 
in addition  during and  great southern s net interest margin was negatively affected by certain characteristics of some of its loans  deposit mix  loan and deposit pricing by competitors  and timing of interest rate increases by the frb as compared to interest rate changes in the financial markets 
for the years ended december  and  interest income was reduced million and  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans which were added to non performing status during and this reduced net interest income and net interest margin 
also  for the year ended december   the average balance of investment securities increased by approximately million due to the purchase of securities to pledge against increased public funds deposits and customer repurchase agreements 
while we earned a positive spread on these securities  it was much smaller than our overall net interest spread  having the effect of increasing net interest income but decreasing net interest margin 
generally  the flattening interest rate yield curve hurt great southern s ability to reinvest proceeds from loan and investment repayments at higher rates 
in and the first nine months of  the company s cost of funds increased faster than its yield on loans and investments 
this trend moderated beginning in the third quarter of as market interest rates started moving lower and the frb cut the federal funds rate beginning in september by a total of basis points to date 
prior to this downward trend  great southern had increased rates on checking  money market and retail certificate accounts in order to remain competitive  while not leading the market 
with the decreases in the federal funds rate  great southern has lowered rates paid on deposits while trying to remain competitive in the market 
great southern s deposit mix has also led to a relatively increased cost of funds 
the company has significant balances in high dollar money market and premium now accounts  the owners of which are very rate sensitive and compare these products to other bank and non bank products available by competing financial services companies 
another factor that negatively impacted net interest income in the latter portion of  was the increase in libor interest rates compared to federal funds rates in the last half of as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate 
the company has interest rate swaps and other borrowings that are indexed to libor  thereby causing increased funding costs 
these higher libor interest rates began to decline to more normal levels during the first two weeks of january additionally  recent frb interest rate cuts have impacted net interest income 
generally  a rate cut by the frb would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on net interest income due to the large total balance of loans that are tied to the prime rate of interest which generally adjust immediately as fed funds adjust 
this negative impact is expected to be offset over the following to day period  and subsequently is expected to have a positive impact  as the company s interest rates on deposits  borrowings and interest rate swaps should also reduce as a result of changes in interest rates by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive loan and deposit pricing pressures 
in and the first half of  margin compression also occurred in the company s investment securities portfolio 
the company added securities in previous years to pledge as collateral to secure public funds deposits and customer reverse repurchase agreements 
the interest rates paid to these customers increased consistent with short term market interest rate increases  while the overall yield on the investment portfolio did not increase as rapidly 
in previous years  the company earned a greater spread on these securities due to the very low rate environment and the then steeper interest rate yield curve compared to and as borrowing costs increased  the spread earned on these securities decreased 
the company has also repositioned some of its investment portfolio over time to shorten the time frame its securities will reprice 
margin compression related to the company s investment securities portfolio improved in the last half of as yields on securities continue to increase and the frb lowered the federal funds rate 
in  the overall yield on the investment portfolio including other interest earning assets increased and was at december  compared to at december  at december   the company also had a portfolio of prime based loans totaling approximately billion with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest 
of this total  million represented loans which had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates  with million of these loans having floor rates of or greater and another million of these loans having floor rates between and 
during and  the company s loan portfolio had loans with rate floors that were much lower 
however  since market interest rates were also much lower at that time  these loan rate floors went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this contributed to a loan yield for the entire portfolio which was approximately and basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  and  respectively 
as interest rates rose in the second half of and throughout and  these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
at december   the loan yield for the portfolio was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest  resulting in lower interest rate margins 
at december   the loan portfolio yield was approximately basis points lower than the prime rate of interest 
during the latter portion of and into  as the prime rate of interest has gone down  the company s loan portfolio again had loans with rate floors that went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this contributed to a loan yield for the entire portfolio which was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  through march   the prime rate of interest has decreased an additional basis points since december  the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by our travel  insurance and investment divisions  late charges and prepayment fees on loans  gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments and other general operating income 
non interest income is also affected by the company s hedging activities 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising and public relations  telephone  professional fees  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   non interest income decreased slightly due primarily to the impairment write down in value of one available for sale freddie mac preferred stock security 
this write down totaled million 
in november and december  the value of this security declined sharply due to the credit and capital concerns faced by many financial services companies  including government sponsored enterprises freddie mac and fannie mae 
excluding this securities loss  non interest income increased primarily as a result of higher commission revenues from our travel  insurance and investment divisions and deposit account charges  partially offset by lower fees on loans 
this increase in commission revenues was primarily in the travel division as a result of the acquisition of a st 
louis travel agency in the first quarter of and internal growth 
fees from service charges and overdrafts will likely increase modestly in compared to as we expect that retail checking accounts will grow at a modest pace in we expect to continue to add checking balances  however  much of this growth is expected to come from additional corporate banking relationships which will not generate as much fee income as smaller individual checking accounts 
the level of commission revenue in our travel division in is likely to remain consistent with levels  however  given current general economic conditions  substantial shocks could occur in the financial markets or the travel industry that could reduce travel by businesses and individuals in currently the company does not have any plans to acquire additional travel agencies 
increasing non interest income in was the early repayment of five unrelated loans that triggered significant prepayment fees 
non interest income increased million in the year ended december   and increased million in the year ended december   as a result of the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits 
in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   operating expenses increased primarily due to the continued growth of the company 
the primary increases were in the categories of salaries and benefits expense  insurance  and expenses on foreclosed assets  with smaller increases and decreases in some of the other expense categories such as occupancy and equipment expense  postage  advertising and others 
during the fourth quarter of  great southern completed its acquisition of a travel agency in columbia  mo  and opened banking centers in lee s summit  mo 
and ozark  mo 
in march  great southern acquired a travel agency in st 
louis  mo  and in june  opened a banking center in springfield  mo 
we anticipate that increases will occur again in  at a moderate level  with regard to employee costs and occupancy expenses as we continue to add new banking centers to serve new and existing customers 
we anticipate that expense increases in will be fairly consistent with the expense increases recorded in in addition  due to the increases in levels of foreclosed assets  foreclosure related expenses in were higher than in in  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic began to once again assess insurance premiums on insured institutions 
under the new pricing system  institutions in all risk categories  even the best rated  are charged an fdic premium 
great southern received a deposit insurance credit as a result of premiums previously paid 
the company s credit offset assessed premiums for the first half of  but premiums were owed by the company in the latter half of for the year ended december   the company incurred additional insurance expense of  the company expects a similar quarterly expense of  in future quarters  with additional expense based upon deposit growth 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement based on an exchange transaction between market participants in which an entity sells an asset or transfers a liability 
sfas no 
also establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
provides companies with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
under the option  any changes in fair value would be included in earnings 
this statement seeks to reduce both complexity in accounting and volatility in earnings caused by differences in the existing accounting rules 
existing accounting principles use different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities  which can lead to earnings volatility 
sfas no 
helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to achieve a more consistent accounting for changes in the fair value of related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under this statement  entities may measure at fair value financial assets and liabilities selected on a contract by contract basis 
they would be required to display those values separately from those measured under different attributes on the face of the statement of financial condition 
furthermore  companies must provide additional information that would help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect on earnings

comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   the company increased total assets by million to billion 
net loans increased by million 
the main loan areas experiencing increases were commercial and residential construction  commercial business  consumer and residential mortgage loans 
the company s strategy continues to be focused on growing the loan portfolio  while maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
for many years  the company has developed a niche in commercial real estate and construction lending in southwest missouri 
great southern s strategy is to continue to build on this competency in southwest missouri and in other geographic areas through the company s loan production offices 
available for sale investment securities increased by million  primarily due to increased balances of u 
s 
government agency securities which were used for pledging to public fund deposit accounts 
while there is no specifically stated goal  the available for sale securities portfolio has in recent years been approximately to of total assets 
the available for sale securities portfolio was and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  primarily due to smaller cash letter settlements between the company and other banks at december  foreclosed assets increased million  primarily due to the foreclosure of several loan relationships throughout see non performing assets for additional information on foreclosed assets 
total liabilities increased million from december  to billion at december  deposits increased million  fhlbank advances increased million and short term borrowings increased million 
the increase in short term borrowings was the result of increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with bank customers million  increases in overnight borrowings million and a term borrowing from the frb million 
fhlbank advances increased from million at december   to million at december  the level of fhlbank advances will fluctuate depending on growth in the company s loan portfolio and other funding needs and sources of the company

checking account balances totaled million at december   up from million at december  subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased million as a result of the company s decision to add a new issue of trust preferred securities in stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december  net income for fiscal year was million and accumulated other comprehensive income increased million  partially offset by dividends declared of million and net repurchases of the company s common stock of million 
in  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share and reissued  shares of company stock at an average price of per share to cover stock option exercises 
management intends to continue to repurchase stock from time to time as long as management believes that repurchasing the stock contributes to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the timing of repurchases  number of shares of stock that will be repurchased and the price that will be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time  the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market  and the projected impact on the company s earnings per share 
results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  net income decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an increase in non interest expense of million  or  an increase in provision for income taxes of  or  and a decrease in non interest income of  or  partially offset by an increase in net interest income of million  or

the tables below and elsewhere in this report excluding hedge accounting entries recorded for the and periods contain reconciliations of this information to the reported information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes that this non gaap financial information is useful in its internal management financial analyses and may also be useful to investors because the company believes that the exclusion of these items from the specified components of net income better reflect the company s underlying operating results during the periods indicated for the reasons described above 
the amortization of the deposit broker fee and the net change in fair value of interest rate swaps and related deposits may be volatile 
for example  if market interest rates decrease significantly  the interest rate swap counterparties may wish to terminate the swaps prior to their stated maturities 
if a swap is terminated  it is likely that the company would redeem the related deposit account at face value 
if the deposit account is redeemed  any unamortized broker fee associated with the deposit account must be written off to interest expense 
in addition  if the interest rate swap is terminated  there may be an income or expense impact related to the fair values of the swap and related deposit which were previously recorded in the company s financial statements 
the effect on net income  net interest income  net interest margin and non interest income could be significant in any given reporting period

interest income for both loans and investment securities and other interest earning assets increased due to higher average balances 
interest income for investment securities and other interest earning assets also increased due to higher average rates of interest while loans experienced average rates of interest that were effectively unchanged 
interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to december   interest income on loans increased primarily due to higher average balances 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the bank s increased commercial and residential construction lending  commercial business lending and consumer lending 
the bank s commercial real estate and multi family residential average loan balances experienced small decreases  while one to four family residential average loan balances increased slightly during interest income on loans decreased  as the result of a slight reduction in average interest rates 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  average loan rates were generally similar in and  as a result of market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest 
during the first half of  market interest rates increased  with the prime rate of interest increasing by the end of june a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
the company has a portfolio of prime based loans which have interest rate floors 
prior to  many of these loan rate floors were in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
during and  as market interest rates rose  many of these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of basis points 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of a negative basis point 
for the years ended december   and  interest income was reduced million and  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
additionally  recent frb interest rate cuts subsequent to december   have impacted interest income and net interest income 
generally  a rate cut by the frb would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on interest income and net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as fed funds adjust 
this negative impact is expected to be offset over the following to day period  and subsequently is expected to have a positive impact  as the company s interest rates on deposits  borrowings and interest rate swaps should also reduce as a result of changes in interest rates by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive loan and deposit pricing pressures 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased as a result of higher average rates of interest during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased by million as a result of an increase in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in  as principal balances on mortgage backed securities were paid down through prepayments and normal amortization  the company replaced a portion of these securities with variable rate mortgage backed securities primarily one year and hybrid arms which had a lower yield at the time of purchase relative to the fixed rate securities remaining in the portfolio 
as these securities reached interest rate reset dates in  their rates increased along with market interest rate increases 
approximately million will have interest rate resets at some time in  with the currently projected weighted average coupon rate decreasing approximately 
based on market interest rates at december  in addition  approximately million will have initial interest rate resets at some time in the actual amount of securities that will reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities is subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
the company has total variable rate mortgage backed securities of approximately million at december  in addition  the company also increased its portfolio of tax exempt securities issued by states and municipalities over the past two years from million at december  to million at december  these securities generally have coupon yields that are comparable to treasury market interest rates  however  the tax equivalent yield is higher 
interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in available for sale agency securities  where securities were needed for liquidity and pledging to deposit accounts under customer repurchase agreements and public fund deposits 
many of these agency securities are callable at the option of the issuer  so it is likely that  as market interest rates have declined  agency security balances will be reduced in total interest expense including the effects of the company s accounting change in for certain interest rate swaps  total interest expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of million  or  an increase in interest expense on short term borrowings of million  or  and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or 
excluding the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  economically  total interest expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of million  or  an increase in interest expense on short term borrowings of million  or  and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or 
see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in interest expense deposits including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  interest on demand deposits increased million due to an increase in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  average interest rates increased due to higher overall market rates of interest in and the first nine months of market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts began to increase prior to as the frb raised short term interest rates 
interest on demand deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances 
the company s interest bearing checking balances have grown in the past several years through increased relationships with correspondent  corporate and retail customers 
average interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average non interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense on deposits increased million as a result of an increase in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the average interest rates increased due to higher overall market rates of interest throughout and into as certificates of deposit matured in and the first half of  they were generally replaced with certificates bearing a higher rate of interest 
market rates of interest on new certificates began to increase in the latter half of through the first half of as the frb raised short term interest rates 
in  the company increased its balances of brokered certificates of deposit to fund a portion of its loan growth 
brokered certificates of deposit balances decreased million in  to million 
retail certificates of deposit increased million in  to million 
in addition  the company s interest rate swaps repriced higher in and in conjunction with the increases in market interest rates  specifically libor 
libor interest rates increased compared to federal funds rates in the last half of as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate 
the company has interest rate swaps and other borrowings that are indexed to libor  thereby causing increased funding costs 
these higher libor interest rates have declined significantly during january and february the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and did not impact interest on demand deposits 
excluding the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  economically  interest expense on deposits increased million as a result of an increase in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the average interest rates increased due to higher overall market rates of interest throughout and into see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased million due to a decrease in average balances on fhlbank advances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the reason for this decrease was the company elected to utilize other forms of alternative funding during partially offsetting this decrease  fhlbank advances experienced an increase in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   resulting in increased interest expense of  interest expense on short term borrowings increased million due to an increase in average balances on short term borrowings from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  partially offsetting this increase  average interest rates decreased from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december   resulting in decreased interest expense of  the increase in balances of short term borrowings was primarily due to increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with great southern s corporate customers and increased short term borrowings in the latter portion of to take advantage of declining federal funds rates 
market rates of interest on short term borrowings increased beginning in the middle of through early as the frb raised short term interest rates 
the frb began to lower short term interest rates in the latter portion of and has continued to lower these rates in the first two months of interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased  due to increases in average balances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the average rate of interest on these subordinated debentures decreased slightly in as these liabilities pay a variable rate of interest that is indexed to libor 
in november  the company redeemed its trust preferred debentures which were issued in and replaced them with new trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
in july  the company issued additional trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are also not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income including the impact of the accounting entries recorded for certain interest rate swaps  net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was in the year ended december   compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
this margin decrease was caused by several factors 
for the years ended december   and  interest income was reduced million and  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
another factor that negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin in  was the increase in the spread between libor interest rates compared to federal funds rates in the last half of as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate 
the company has interest rate swaps and other borrowings that are indexed to libor  thereby causing increased funding costs 
these relative higher libor interest rates have declined to more normal levels in additionally  recent frb interest rate cuts have impacted net interest income 
generally  a rate cut by the frb would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as fed funds adjust 
this negative impact is expected to be offset over the following to day period  and subsequently is expected to have a positive impact  as the company s interest rates on deposits  borrowings and interest rate swaps should also reduce as a result of changes in interest rates by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive loan and deposit pricing pressures 
the company s overall interest rate spread decreased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to a basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis point while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets increased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits increased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances increased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points 
see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in for the year ended december   compared to  the average balance of investment securities increased by approximately million due to the purchase of securities in early to pledge against increased public fund deposits and customer repurchase agreements 
while the company earned a positive spread on these securities  it was much smaller than the company s overall net interest spread  having the effect of increasing net interest income but decreasing net interest margin 
excluding the impact of the accounting entries recorded for certain interest rate swaps  economically  net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin excluding the effects of the accounting change was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the company s overall interest rate spread decreased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to a basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis point while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets increased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits increased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances increased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points 
the prime rate of interest averaged during the year ended december  compared to an average of during the year ended december  the prime rate began to increase in the second half of and throughout and as the frb began to raise short term interest rates  and stood at at december  in the last three months of  the frb began to decrease short term interest rates 
at december   the prime rate stood at 
over half of the bank s loans were tied to prime at december  the company continues to utilize interest rate swaps and fhlbank advances that reprice frequently to manage overall interest rate risk

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in versus million in the increases in charge offs and foreclosed assets were due to general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects 
as properties were transferred into foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on recent internal and external reviews of the company s loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
potential problem loans are included in management s consideration when determining the adequacy of the provision and allowance for loan losses 
non performing assets as a result of continued growth in the loan portfolio  changes in portfolio mix  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time  and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets at december   were million  up million from december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december  compared to december   non performing loans increased million to million while foreclosed assets increased million to million 
commercial real estate  commercial and residential construction and business loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  commercial real estate  construction and business loans historically comprise the majority of non performing loans 
net charge offs for the year ended december   were million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increases in charge offs and foreclosed assets were due to general economic and market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects

a million loan relationship  which is secured by a restaurant building in northwest arkansas 
the company has begun foreclosure on this property 
a million loan relationship  which was described in the march   quarterly report on form q

the remaining million is secured by the borrower s ownership interest in a business 
the borrower is pursuing options to pay off this loan 
a million loan relationship  which is primarily secured by two office and retail historic rehabilitation developments

a million loan relationship  which is secured by partially developed subdivision lots in northwest arkansas 
the company has begun foreclosure proceedings 
at december   eight significant loan relationships accounted for million of the total non performing loan balance of million 
in addition to the five relationships noted above  three other loan relationships were previously included in non performing loans and remained there at december  these relationships were described in the december   annual report on form k  and in previous quarterly reports on form q 
one of these relationships  a million loan on a nursing home in the state of missouri  was paid off in the first quarter of upon the sale of the facility 
the company had previously recorded a charge to the allowance for loan losses regarding this relationship and recovered approximately  to the allowance upon receipt of the loan payoff 
the other two unrelated relationships totaled million and million  respectively 
both of these relationships are secured primarily by single family houses and residential subdivision lots 
the million relationship has been foreclosed upon and transferred to foreclosed assets at a book value of  after a charge off to the allowance for loan losses of  the company is in process of foreclosing on the million relationship and is currently determining what  if any  charge off to the allowance for loan losses is needed regarding this relationship 
two other significant relationships were both added to the non performing loans category and subsequently transferred to foreclosed assets during the year ended december  a million loan relationship  described in the june   quarterly report on form q  which is secured by two residential developments in the kansas city  mo  metropolitan area 
at the time of the transfer to foreclosed assets  the asset was reduced to million through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses

potential problem loans 
potential problem loans increased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans increased primarily due to the addition of six unrelated relationships totaling million to the potential problem loans category 
four of these relationships involve residential construction and development loans 
two relationships are in springfield  mo  and total million and million  respectively  one relationship near little rock  ark 
totals million  and one relationship in the st

the motel is operating but payment performance has been slow at times 
at december   these eight significant relationships described above accounted for million of the potential problem loan total 
subsequent event regarding potential problem loans 
one of the bank s largest lending relationships is a loan to an arkansas based bank holding company abhc 
in addition  the bank has made other loans to three of abhc s stockholders two of which are directors and or executive officers of the holding company and the bank  at least partially secured by abhc s stock 
abhc  through its subsidiary bank abank  is primarily a commercial real estate lender with an emphasis on land development and residential construction lending 
in addition to the arkansas lending franchise  abank also has significant lending activities in the mountain west and southwest regions of the united states 
the lending relationship with abhc began in  and is secured by a first lien against of the stock of abank 
the loans to the stockholders are secured by each stockholder s stock in abhc  as well as other collateral 
at december   the outstanding balance on the loan to abhc was million 
the loan was current as of that date  and abank s capital exceeded the amount of the loan  but the borrower was in default on certain of its financial covenants 
during the past several months  markets for land development and new housing nationally  and particularly in arkansas and portions of the southwest  have seen a downturn 
abank began to experience the effects of this downturn through increased delinquencies and somewhat higher levels of non performing loans in as a result  abank s regulators restricted certain of abank s operations and required increased reserves and capital 
subsequent to december   abank reported that non performing loans and foreclosed assets increased dramatically and significant additional reserves were being taken  reducing abank s capital even further 
as a result  during the march  quarter  great southern has classified abhc s loan as substandard and included it in potential problem loans 
based upon abank s most recent call report as amended  abank s capital has been reduced but is still at a level that appears to provide adequate collateral for great southern s loan 
thus  great southern has not made a specific allocation of its allowance for loan losses to the abhc credit 
since the beginning of this year  great southern has obtained additional  unrelated collateral to help secure a portion of the outstanding balance of the loans to the individual stockholders  and a million payment was made reducing one of the loans 
to date  however  there is still a portion that is not covered by additional collateral 
therefore  million of the loans to individual stockholders have been classified as substandard and are now included in potential problem loans and million of these loans are now considered non performing 
a specific allocation in the bank s allowance for loan losses has been set up for a portion of the non performing and a portion of the substandard loans to the individual stockholders 
based on the information currently available  the company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the ability of abhc to ultimately resolve its issues and pay the bank s loan off is subject to a number of factors  including the land development and housing markets in its market areas  the strength of its borrowers  the ability of abhc and abank to restructure their balance sheets and increase capital and the ability of abhc and abank to timely comply with the requirements of their federal bank regulators 
the federal bank regulators have extensive enforcement authority over abhc and abank  giving them the ability to take actions which could negatively impact our lending position without prior notice to us 
in addition  if abhc and abank are not successful in their efforts  the loan may be required to be charged off in whole or in part  significantly reducing future income 
abhc and abank are actively pursuing various alternatives to work out their credit problems  increase capital ratios and strengthen their balance sheets 
great southern is monitoring these activities closely  but does not control the process 
non interest income including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the  or  decrease in non interest income was primarily the result of the impairment write down in value of one available for sale freddie mac preferred stock security 
this write down totaled million 
this security has an interest rate that resets to a market index every months and currently yields a tax equivalent interest rate of about 
the security has had unrealized gains and losses from time to time 
these unrealized gains and losses were recorded directly to equity in prior periods  so this other than temporary write down did not affect total equity 
throughout the first ten months of  as expected  the fair value of the security increased as market interest rates fell 
however  in november and december the value of this security declined sharply due to the credit and capital concerns faced by many financial services companies  including government sponsored enterprises freddie mac and fannie mae 
freddie mac and fannie mae have recently issued new perpetual preferred stock at higher yields than this security and that has also driven the value down for many of the previously issued preferred stocks 
the company has the ability to continue to hold this security in its portfolio for the foreseeable future and believes that the fair value of this security may recover from the current level in future periods  if and when credit and capital concerns subside for these government sponsored enterprises 
other items of non interest income in increased  compared to  primarily as a result of higher revenue from commissions and deposit account charges  partially offset by lower fees on loans 
for the year ended december   service charges on deposit accounts and atm fees increased  or  compared to due to the increase in deposit accounts 
during  commission income from the company s travel  insurance and investment divisions increased  or  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily in the travel division as a result of the acquisition of a st 
louis travel agency in the first quarter of and internal growth 
total late charges and fees on loans decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the same period in due primarily to the early repayment of five unrelated loans that triggered total prepayment fees of  in the year ended december  although the company does receive prepayment fees from time to time  it is difficult to forecast when and in what amounts these fees will be collected 
non interest income increased million in the year ended december   and increased million in the year ended december   as a result of the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits 
see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in other income in and includes the net benefits realized on federal historic tax credits utilized by the company in both and the company expects to utilize federal historic tax credits in the future  however  the timing and amount of these credits will vary depending upon availability of the credits and ability of the company to utilize the credits

under the new pricing system  institutions in all risk categories  even the best rated  are charged an fdic premium 
great southern received a deposit insurance credit as a result of premiums previously paid 
the company s credit offset assessed premiums for the first half of  but premiums were owed by the company in the latter half of the company incurred additional insurance expense of  related to this in  and the company expects expense of approximately  per quarter in subsequent quarters  with additional expense based upon deposit growth 
due to the increases in levels of foreclosed assets  foreclosure related expenses in were higher than by approximately  net of income received on foreclosed assets 
as previously disclosed in the company s filings for the fourth quarter and full year  these periods included an expense item of   after tax  which was a non cash write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the redemption of the cumulative trust preferred securities of great southern capital trust i 
the company s increase in non interest expense in compared to also related to the continued growth of the company 
during the fourth quarter of  great southern completed its acquisition of a travel agency in columbia  mo  and opened banking centers in lee s summit  mo

in march  great southern acquired a travel agency in st

the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  an additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets as a result of continued growth in the loan portfolio  changes in portfolio mix  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time  and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate

commercial real estate  construction and business loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  commercial real estate  construction and business loans historically comprise the majority of non performing loans 
non performing loans 
compared to december   non performing loans increased million to million 
non performing loans increased primarily as a result of the addition of two unrelated loan relationships to the non performing category since december  in addition  two other relationships that were included in the non performing loans category at december   were increased due to the transfer of additional loan balances from the potential problem loans category during these increases were partially offset by the reduction of several loan relationships that were included in the non performing category at december  at december   the six significant relationships remaining in the non performing category described below accounted for million of the non performing loan total 
the two relationships that were added to the non performing category during included a million relationship and a million relationship

the two relationships that were increased in the non performing category during included a million relationship and a million relationship 
the million relationship was included in non performing loans as million at december   million was added to the non performing loans category from the potential problem loans category during the three months ended june  the million portion of this relationship is secured by a nursing home in missouri that has had cash flow problems 
the additional million is secured by a second nursing home in the springfield  missouri  area 
this second nursing home has performed satisfactorily  however  due to the performance issues of the other property  the entire relationship has now been categorized as non performing 
the million relationship was discussed in the december  annual report on form k  where million was included in the non performing loans category and million was included in the potential problem loans category 
this relationship is secured by commercial real estate  vacant land  developed and undeveloped residential subdivisions  houses under construction and houses used as rental property 
the company determined that the transfer of the potential problem loans portion of the relationship to the non performing loans category was warranted due to continued deterioration of payment performance 
during the three months ended march   the company recorded a charge off of  on this relationship 
in addition  during  the borrower sold some of the commercial real estate  houses and subdivision lots 
the proceeds of these sales were used to reduce loan balances 
two additional unrelated credit relationships were included in non performing loan totals at december   and remain non performing loans at december  the first relationship totaled  at december  and is secured primarily by a mobile home park in the kansas city  missouri  metropolitan area and other commercial real estate collateral

potential problem loans 
potential problem loans decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans decreased primarily due to the transfer to the non performing loan category portions of four unrelated loan relationships  partially offset by the addition of two significant unrelated loan relationships and other smaller unrelated relationships 
at december   three large unrelated relationships made up a large portion of the potential problem loan category 
the first relationship totaled million and is secured primarily by a retail center  developed and undeveloped residential subdivisions  and single family houses being constructed for resale in the springfield  missouri  area

service charges on deposit accounts and atm fees increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  in the company increased some of its per item charges on certain account activities 
in addition  a portion of the fee increase is attributed to growth in accounts to which charges may apply

one additional item that decreased non interest income in the year ended december  was the impairment write down in value of one available for sale government preferred stock agency security 
this write down totaled  in this security has a dividend rate that resets to a market index every months 
the security has had an unrealized loss that was recorded directly to equity prior to december   so the write down did not affect total equity 
during  the fair value of the security has recovered some of the decline in value 
this unrealized gain is being recorded directly to equity 
the company has the ability to continue to hold this security in its portfolio for the foreseeable future and believes that the fair value of this security may recover further in future periods  particularly as the next dividend rate reset date approaches

financing activities provided cash flows of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities in the future are expected to primarily include changes in deposits  changes in fhlbank advances  changes in short term borrowings  purchases of company stock and dividend payments to stockholders

during the year ended december   the company declared dividends of per share of net income per share and paid dividends of per share of net income per share 
the board of directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments 
the dividend declared but unpaid as of december   was paid to shareholders on january  common stock repurchases 
the company has been in various buy back programs since may during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share and reissued  shares of company stock at an average price of per share to cover stock option exercises 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share and reissued  shares of company stock at an average price of per share to cover stock option exercises 
management intends to continue its stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock contributes to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock that will be repurchased and the price that will be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is slightly positive 
generally  a rate cut by the frb would be expected to have an immediate negative impact on great southern s net interest income due to the large total balances of loans which adjust to the prime interest rate daily 
the company believes that this negative impact would be negated over the subsequent to day period as the company s interest rates on deposits  borrowings and interest rate swaps should also reduce proportionately to the changes by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive pricing pressures 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
the company enters into interest rate swap derivatives  primarily as an asset liability management strategy  in order to hedge the change in the fair value from recorded fixed rate liabilities long term fixed rate cds 
the terms of the swaps are carefully matched to the terms of the underlying hedged item and when the relationship is properly documented as a hedge and proven to be effective  it is designated as a fair value hedge 
the fair market value of derivative financial instruments is based on the present value of future expected cash flows from those instruments discounted at market forward rates and are recognized in the statement of financial condition in the prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses caption 
effective changes in the fair market value of the hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate are similarly recognized in the statement of financial condition in the prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses caption 
effective gains losses are reported in interest expense and  of ineffectiveness was recorded in income in the non interest income caption for the year ended december  gains and losses on early termination of the designated fair value derivative financial instruments are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield on the related liability over the shorter of the remaining contract life or the maturity of the related asset or liability 
if the related liability is sold or otherwise liquidated  the fair market value of the derivative financial instrument is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or a liability in prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses with the resultant gains and losses recognized in non interest income 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with the objective of economically hedging against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit caused by changes in market interest rates 
the swap agreements generally provide for the company to pay a variable rate of interest based on a spread to the one month or three month london interbank offering rate libor and to receive a fixed rate of interest equal to that of the hedged instrument 
under the swap agreements the company is to pay or receive interest monthly  quarterly  semiannually or at maturity 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was approximately million 
of this amount  million consisted of swaps in a net settlement receivable position and million consisted of swaps in a net settlement payable position 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was approximately million 
of this amount  million consisted of swaps in a net settlement receivable position and million consisted of swaps in a net settlement payable position 
the maturities of interest rate swaps outstanding at december  and  in terms of notional amounts and their average pay and receive rates is discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements
