item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the world leader in hand carried ultrasound  or hcu  systems 
we specialize in the development of hcu systems for use in a variety of medical specialties in a range of clinical settings at the point of care 
our proprietary technologies have enabled us to design hcu systems that combine high resolution  all digital  broadband imaging with advanced features and capabilities typically found on cart based ultrasound systems 
we believe that the performance  size  durability  ease of use and cost effectiveness of our products are expanding existing ultrasound markets  and are opening new markets by bringing ultrasound visualization out of the imaging lab to the point of care such as the patient s bedside or the physician s examining table for diagnosis and procedural guidance 
the large size  weight and complexity of traditional cart based ultrasound systems typically require a physician or highly trained clinician to perform the examination in a centralized imaging department  such as a hospital s radiology department 
our strategic intent is to enable clinicians to use ultrasound in a variety of clinical settings by developing each potential market based on three fundamental tenets i the design of high performance system hardware  software and transducers with application specific settings and capabilities  ii the provision of educational training that ensures appropriate use of the equipment in the clinical setting  and iii the support of professional institutions and ultrasound thought leaders in the completion of use protocols and clinical research that accelerates the adoption of hcu to improve patient outcomes 
by providing ultrasound at the primary point of care  our systems expedite diagnosis and treatment in acute and critical care settings and provide visual guidance for interventional procedures 
in outpatient settings  our systems can eliminate delays associated with the outpatient referral process 
this increased accessibility is changing clinical practice  improving patient care and safety and has the potential to reduce healthcare costs through earlier diagnosis of diseases and conditions 
we design our products for applications where ultrasound has not typically been used such as emergency medicine  surgery  critical care  internal medicine and vascular access procedures as well as for imaging in traditional applications  such as radiology  cardiology  vascular medicine and obstetrics and gynecology ob gyn 
in addition  the us military has successfully deployed our systems in traditional hospital settings  field hospitals and forward surgical teams in war zones and areas of conflict 
we began shipping our first products in september and today have an installed base of thousands of systems worldwide 
our fourth generation product platform is the basis of two product lines  the m turbo tm system and the s series tm ultrasound tools  which we introduced in october these products together with the micromaxx r system  our third generation of hand carried technology and introduced in  offer a broad based product portfolio for hospital and physician office markets 
based on our proprietary application specific integrated circuit asic technology for high resolution ultrasound imaging these systems offer image resolution comparable to costly  conventional cart based ultrasound systems weighing over pounds 
a five year warranty covering the system and most of the transducers  comes standard with these products 
our second generation product  the titan r system  began shipping in this system addresses point of care and traditional ultrasound markets 
our first generation of products includes the tm and ilook r series 
the sonosite plus tm system is designed for general ultrasound imaging and the sonoheart r elite is specifically configured for cardiovascular applications 
the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide visual guidance for physicians and nurses while performing vascular access procedures and the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide imaging of the chest and abdomen 
we currently face competition from companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do and offer a range of products 
table of contents broader than our products 
the dominant competitors in this industry are ge healthcare  a unit of general electric company  siemens medical solutions  or siemens  and philips medical systems  a division of koninklijke philips electronics  nv  or philips 
in addition  as the market for high performance  hcu systems develops  we expect competition to increase as potential and existing competitors enter the portable market or modify their existing products to more closely approximate the combined portability  quality  performance and cost of our products 
our current competitors in the portable market include ge healthcare  siemens  philips  biosound esaote  inc  medison america inc  a subsidiary of medison company  ltd  or medison america  terason  a division of teratech corporation  or terason  and zonare medical systems  inc  a privately held company  or zonare 
we commenced operations as a division of atl ultrasound  inc  or atl 
on april   we became an independent  publicly owned company through a distribution of one new share of our stock for every three shares of atl stock held as of that date 
atl retained no ownership in sonosite following the spin off 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include accounts receivable  revenue recognition  valuation of investments and inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  warranty expense  income taxes  stock based compensation  our convertible note and hedge transaction and acquisitions 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  credit history and current economic condition 
losses can be difficult to anticipate 
an increase in losses beyond those expected by management would reduce earnings when they become probable or as the estimated loss increases 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are provided or over the term of the contract 
revenue is recorded net of estimated returns 
we estimate returns by reviewing our historical returns  considering customer reaction to new product introductions and current economic conditions 
sales discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
we separately price and sell product upgrades to our customers 
sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard distributor agreements 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred to the distributor 
our only significant post shipment obligation to distributors is our product warranty covering materials and workmanship see warranty expense below 
the distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error  generally within days of receipt  and in such cases  replacement products would be sent 
since the distributor s remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit  we do not defer revenue associated with these sales 
costs associated with the 
table of contents repair of returned  defective products are captured in our warranty accrual 
our standard distributor arrangements do not have any other return provisions 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
revenue from the sale of software  software related elements  and hardware when the software elements are more than incidental to the product as a whole  is recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition rules 
we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our products 
accordingly  for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have vsoe of the elements  revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer 
when the undelivered element represents services under extended service contracts  revenue equal to the stated price is deferred and recognized evenly over the contract term as those services are provided 
investments 
our investment securities primarily consist of high grade us government or corporate debt and high grade asset backed securities 
we have the ability to hold our securities until maturity  however  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
these securities are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses generally reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities  if any  are determined on a specific identification basis 
a decline in market value of any available for sale security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary results in a revaluation of its carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
we may incur unrealized losses due to changes in market value attributable to changes in interest rates 
generally we have the ability and intent to hold our investments until a recovery of cost  which may be maturity 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs to their net realizable values are recorded for obsolete material  shrinkage  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventories based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost of businesses acquired over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could potentially result in recognition of an impairment of goodwill  which would be reflected as a loss on our consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technologies  non compete agreements and reacquired distribution rights 
we use our judgment to estimate the fair value of each of these intangible assets 
our judgment about fair value is based on our expectation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we also use our judgment to estimate the useful lives of each intangible asset 
with 
table of contents respect to definite lived intangible assets  we evaluate the remaining useful lives and whether there are any indicators of impairment as circumstances dictate 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
if we conclude that any intangible asset is impaired  we would record this as a loss on our consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction to the intangible asset 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expense is made based upon our historical product failure rates and service repair costs using management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
we provide  with certain exceptions  a five year warranty with the micromaxx system  m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools 
given the length of the warranty period  the warranty liability for these systems is more difficult to estimate than it has been for our other products that have a one year warranty 
however  given the similarity of the components used in the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools compared with our micromaxx system and the historical product failure rate and service repair costs of the micromaxx and the other systems  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the warranty liability for these products 
we expect our warranty liability and expense to continue to increase significantly due to the five year warranty offered with these products 
should actual failure rates or repair or replacement costs for any of our products differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and our results may be materially affected 
income taxes 
the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
we have accumulated us federal and state income tax nol carryforwards  foreign nol carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet primarily representing nols from our international operations 
previously  we had recorded a valutation allowance against deferred tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets related to either our us or international operations would be realized 
we assess our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards utilized currently 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
based upon a review of historical operating performance through  and our expectation that we will generate profits in the us and our international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us and international deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
for stock options  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock based compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life and expected forfeitures 
we estimate 
table of contents volatility by considering our historical stock volatility 
we estimate expected term based on historical trends 
further  we estimate future forfeitures for both stock options and rsus granted  which are not expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures using historical employee turn over rates as well as our judgment of future forfeitures 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from our estimate 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock based compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on  or determined from  external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock based payment arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
in addition  future grants of equity awards will result in additional compensation expense in future periods 
convertible debt and hedge transaction 
we have recorded our senior convertible note as debt 
the conversion option met the criteria  in our judgment  to preclude recognition as a debt discount 
if the conversion option had been recognized as a debt discount  it would have been recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the notes 
accordingly  our interest expense is based upon the stated rate 
additionally  we recorded the call option and warrant transactions as equity instruments since our judgment is that they met the existing criteria 
if the call option and warrant transactions had not met the criteria  then the instruments would have been recorded as assets or liabilities and any changes in the fair values would be recognized in the consolidated income statement 
acquisitions 
the process of accounting for an acquisition involves determining whether a business or assets were acquired  then assigning the cost to the fair value of the assets acquired 
in our judgment we acquired assets when we purchased lumenvu  inc in july  rather than a business 
additionally  we determined that the acquired technology did not represent in process research and development  which would have been expensed upon acquisition rather than capitalized as an intangible asset 
results of operations revenue revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to the introduction of new products in q and increased sales of micromaxx systems offset by a reduction in sales of earlier products 
the increase in compared to was due to a full year of sales of the micromaxx system  which has a higher average selling price than the titan system  expanded international operations  and increased direct sales to hospitals 
changes in exchange rates had a positive impact on revenue in and had a minimal impact on revenue in united states us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to increased sales in both hospital and office channels 
the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to increased direct sales to hospitals  offset by a decrease in us government sales due to a large order in the first quarter of and a decrease during the integration of our sales channel partner addressing the physician office market 
international revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in revenue from direct sales in the uk  france and spain offset by decreases in direct sales to italy  
table of contents which became a direct sales subsidiary in september  and in germany 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased sales in our direct subsidiaries in europe  offset by decreased sales to our distributor in italy 
revenue from latin america and canada increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to a significant increase in canada due to the sales force expansion and expansion of the dealer network in latin america 
the increase in compared to was due to increased direct sales in canada and increased sales to our distributors in latin america 
revenue from asia pacific increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due the expansion of the sales force 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to distribution sales through our new distributor  fukuda denshi in japan 
we anticipate that revenue will increase in compared to due to the continued expansion of our selling efforts worldwide 
we expect growth from the introduction of new products and features  from the us physicians office market as we continue to develop this channel  from the continued expansion of international operations such as india and italy  and the overall expansion of market awareness and acceptance of our products 
the expansion of new sales operations  as well as the integration of the us physician office market sales force  after the termination of our relationship with marketbridge in january  may not be as successful as anticipated and we may encounter regulatory and other issues in selling our products 
our revenue may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the usd 
increased competition may also impact our anticipated growth in revenue 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
gross margin gross margin decreased to in compared to in and in the decrease in compared to was impacted negatively from the increased sales to our distributor network and transitioning of sales from micromaxx to the new products  offset by the reduction in royalties to atl  which expired in september and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates 
the increase in compared to was a result of increased sales of micromaxx systems which generate a higher margin than our earlier generation products 
we expect our gross margin percentage in to remain consistent with nevertheless  increased competition from existing and new competitors could result in lower average realized prices and could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct  government and distributor sales  mix of us and international sales  and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying value of our inventory  resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our costs of revenue  a decrease in our gross margin or lost sales 
our gross margin may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the usd 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to increased headcount for development of the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools  which were released in  and for future new products and features 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased stock based compensation and increased headcount to support further development of our asic technology and the micromaxx system 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in compared to due to continued development of new products and features  as well as further development related to the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools 
however  should our competitors develop products with features that equal or exceed the features that exist in our products  we may incur higher than anticipated research and development costs in order to accelerate existing programs and compete more effectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to the expansion of international sales operations  continued growth in the office by our sales channel partner  and increased efforts in education and training 
the increase in compared to was attributable to increased stock based compensation  expansion of our sales channel partner into the physician s office market and our international sales operations  increased education and training efforts and commissions related to the increase in revenue 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase modestly in compared to due to increased compensation for commissions related to the anticipated increase in revenues and expansion of operations in india and italy 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased legal costs related to our patent litigation 
the increase in compared to was attributable to increased stock based compensation and increased headcount to support business growth  offset by a reduction in legal expenses 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain consistent in compared to however  we may incur increased legal expenses regarding our ongoing litigation or unanticipated legal expenses if we become involved in any new litigation 
other income loss total other income was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to increased interest income  resulting from higher cash and investment balances  and higher foreign currency gains  offset by interest expense from our convertible senior notes 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in interest income  which was attributable to our increased cash and investment balances 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in  million in  and million in due to our profitable operations in  and  we recorded income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and accordingly reflected changes in our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily representing net operating losses from our international operations  resulting in a reduction of million to our income tax provision 
we did not reverse the valuation allowance until it was more likely than not that the tax asset would be realized 
the income tax expense is based on a blended federal and state rate applied to us income and the applicable foreign rates applied to 
table of contents foreign income 
while this tax expense reduced net income  no cash will be paid for income taxes  other than required alternative minimum tax and foreign and state tax payments  until the nol and tax credits have been fully utilized 
foreign nols will be utilized in jurisdictions where they are available and cash will be paid in jurisdictions that do not have foreign nols 
we assess our ability to realize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol carryforwards utilized currently as well as the reversing effect of temporary differences 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market accounts 
our short term and long term investment securities totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  investment securities generally consist of high grade us government or corporate debt and high grade asset backed securities 
we have the ability to hold our securities until maturity  however  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
as of december   we had million in columbia strategic cash portfolio  which is in the process of liquidation 
in our judgment this investment  which is classified as a money market account  has a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  accordingly we have recognized an impairment loss of million 
distributions from this portfolio are solely at the discretion of the portfolio manager 
we anticipate that million will be distributed from this portfolio during  which is recorded as a short term investment  and million will be distributed after  which is recorded as a long term investment 
operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in and cash used of million in the comparison of cash provided in compared to was primarily due to increases in accrued expenses and deferred income tax provision  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the cash provided in compared to the cash used in was primarily due to increased net income before non cash stock based compensation in our consolidated statements of operations and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  reduced by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
we anticipate that cash provided by operations will increase in compared to primarily due to anticipated continued profitable operations 
our ability to provide cash from operations will depend on our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
investing activities used cash of million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in cash used in compared to was due to the net purchases of investment securities of million and our acquisition of lumenvu of million 
the increase in cash used in compared to was due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
we anticipate using cash to invest in high quality investment instruments in  the extent of which will depend on the interest rate environment during the period and the timing of cash flows from our operations during the period 
financing activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt of million and the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan totaling million  offset by the net purchase of the call option intended to partially hedge our convertible note for million and issuance of warrants for million in this compared to proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million in and million in 
table of contents we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures in nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash in order to complete future acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended and as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than obligations under our operating leases reflected in the contractual obligations table below 
we are not a party to any derivative transactions except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions that we enter into from time to time  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below and the call option and warrant instruments indexed to our common stock 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees require only disclosure 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been reflected as either liabilities or as a reduction of deferred tax assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
other commitments in  we entered into an agreement to contribute up to million to a research university 
this pledge  which is to be paid over a four year period  is conditioned upon our election to make a payment on an annual basis 
we contributed million in  million in and million in as part of our agreements with our suppliers  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
at december  we maintained a deposit of million with our bank in the united kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges 
this amount is included in other long term assets 

table of contents in the us  we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare group purchasing organizations gpo 
typically  a gpo negotiates with medical suppliers  such as us  on behalf of the gpo s member healthcare facilities  providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions 
in exchange  the gpo identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members 
member facilities participating in the gpo s purchasing program can consist of hospitals  medical group practices  nursing homes  surgery centers  managed care organizations  long term care facilities  clinics and integrated delivery networks 
currently  we have gpo supply agreements with various groups including amerinet  inc  premier  inc  novation llc  medassets hsca  inc  broadlane  inc includes kaiser permanente  tenet healthcare and others  consorta  inc and roi sisters of mercy and first choice 
these agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements 
we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales and marketing expenses in the amounts of million in  million in and million in recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  including an amendment to fasb statement no 
under sfas  entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election  called the fair value option  will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement consistent with the board s long term objectives for financial instruments 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after november  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas r and sfas no 
 non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 sfas 
these new standards will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and non controlling minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas r and sfas are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after december  we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas r and sfas to determine the impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our investments consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities or expected maturities of less than one year and million of interest bearing debt securities 
table of contents with expected maturities of more than one year 
generally we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity  however  we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk except for sales transacted by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  we transact all our sales in usds  therefore  the obligations of many of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international subsidiaries  which may result in foreign exchange losses on transactions with them  and our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by them 
as of december  of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers  of which  or million  was denominated in a currency other than usds 
total sales for the year ended december  denominated in a currency other than usds were million  or of total consolidated revenues 
the british pound  the european union euro and the japanese yen represented the majority of financial transactions executed in a currency not denominated in usds 
we regularly review our receivable positions in foreign countries for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit where they are considered necessary in order to mitigate our collection risk 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward and participating forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had million in notional amount of foreign currency contracts that expire on march  they serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the usd 
these foreign currencies primarily include the british pound  the euro and the japanese yen 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of these contracts indicates that if the usd weakened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  if the usd strengthened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million 
gains and losses in the fair value of these contracts are intended to offset the losses and a portion of the gains on the underlying intercompany balances 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis above 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was not material to our results of operations or our financial position
