overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  mechanism targeted drugs to treat human cancers and other serious disorders 
our strategy is focused on leading edge therapeutic management of cancer patients based on a portfolio of three medicines marketed by our align subsidiary and a deep development pipeline 
we market directly in the us xclair cream for radiation dermatitis and numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges for xerostomia 
we have three orally available drugs that are in clinical development sapacitabine in two randomized phase studies for the treatment of elderly acute myeloid leukemia or aml  and cutaneous t cell lymphoma or ctcl  seliciclib in two randomized phase studies for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer or nsclc and nasopharyngeal cancers or npc and cyc in a phase study in patients with solid tumors 
our core area of experti se is in cell cycle biology  or the processes by which cells divide and multiply 
we focus primarily on the discovery and development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we are generating several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase or cdk inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial factor receptor or ak vegfr inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor and ak inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in phas e trials in aml  seliciclib is the only orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials and cyc is the only ak inhibitor in clinical trials that also interacts with vegfr we have worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine  seliciclib and cyc and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
we are also progressing further novel drug series  principally for cancer  which are at earlier stages 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
our corporate headquarters is located in berkeley heights  new jersey  while our main research facility is located in dundee  scotland  and a second research facility located in cambridge  england 
from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit during the development stage was approximately million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical  pre clinical and other drugs currently in development 
our operating expenses comprise research and development expenses and selling and general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements  licensing revenue  interest on investments  government grants and 
table of contents research and development tax credits 
our revenue has consisted of collaboration and grant revenue and in will include sales of our medical devices following the align acquisition 
we have not reported any revenue from sales of our commercial products in  in accordance with our accounting policies  but expect to do so in we have recognized revenues from inception through december  of million of which million is derived from fees under collaborative agreements and million of grant revenue from various united kingdom government grant awards 
we have also recognized amounts receivable from the united kingdom s tax authority  hm revenue customs of million for research and development tax credits since inception 
recent events acquisition of align pharmaceuticals  inc on october   achilles acquisition  llc renamed immediately following the acquisition to align pharmaceuticals  llc  or align  a wholly owned subsidiary of cyclacel  entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with align pharmaceuticals  llc and align holdings  llc or sellers  to acquire substantially all of the sellers assets 
the transaction closed on the same date 
notably  we acquired the sellers exclusive rights to sell and distribute three products in the united states used potentially to manage the effects of radiation or chemotherapy in cancer patients xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
the acquired business provides cyclacel with the foundation to build a commercial organization focused on cancer that is primarily complementary to cyclacel s oncology hematology products in development and is part of our strategy to build a diversified biopharmaceutical business 
as consideration for the asset purchase and pursuant and subject to the terms of the agreement  we paid million in cash to the sellers and may pay an additional aggregate amount of million within business days from the closing date of the asset acquisition  in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof 
in addition  we may be required to issue to the sellers a maximum number of  shares of common stock 
issuance is contingent upon the achievement of certain operational and financial milestones and subject to satisfaction of any outstanding indemnification obligations by the sellers 
we will issue the shares of our common stock only to the extent that the milestones are achieved 
we are also committed  as part of securing long term supply arrangements  to make future payments of approximately million in and million in the transaction has been accounted for as a business combination and the consolidated results of operations of cyclacel will include the results of operations of the sellers from the closing date 
the assets and certain agreed liabilities of align will be recorded as of the closing date at their estimated fair values

research and development expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs decreased or million from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  significant components of the change relate to a decrease in the charge for stock based compensation of million from million during to million during as a result of the stock options granted during june being two thirds vested immediately upon grant 
this decrease was offset by an increase in costs of million related to sapacitabine and seliciclib as we increased the number of phase trials in additionally  cyc expenses decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the decreases in expenses were attributable to the cyc program being in full pre clinical studies during and then moving to a phase study in fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs increased or million from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the overall increase primarily relates to an increase in the charge for stock based compensation of million offset by the effects of the phasing of our clinical trials with the completion stages of phase a clinical trials of seliciclib in followed by a period of reduced spending prior to the 
table of contents start of the phase b trial in the second quarter of expenditure increased gradually as our efforts focused on initiating the recruited sites for the phase b trials during the second half of together with an increase in research and development expenditure on cyc as activities focused on ind directed studies on this program culminating in the filing of the ind as scheduled in december the future we plan to increase our investment in our research and development programs to further enhance our clinical and regulatory capabilities to allow us to advance the development of our drug candidates

total selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and respectively 
fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditure decreased or million from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the reduction in expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in the charge for stock based compensation of million from million during to million during offset by sales and marketing expenditure of million related to the new align acquisition and delaware taxation  recruitment costs  legal costs that each have increased by million 
fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditure increased or million from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase arose primarily from the new combined business entity and our increased costs of operating as a public company and increased compensation and benefit expenses 
the charge for stock based compensation increased million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in salary and benefit expense increased by million in the year ended december  compared with the same period in this increase was due primarily to the incorporation of payroll costs relating to the remaining support staff of xcyte as of march   increased bonus payments and united kingdom payroll taxes incurred in connection with the issue of group preferred d shares to certain directors and officers in march prior to the stock purchase 
regulatory  corporate and advisors costs together with insurances have increased million  of which approximately million relates to compliance costs for section of the sarbanes oxley act  in the year ended december  compared with the same period in rental and maintenance of the seattle office and bothell manufacturing facilities together with our corporate headquarters in new jersey have given rise to million of additional costs in the year ended december  there were no comparable expenses recognized in the year ended december  the future following the acquisition of align we expect to incur additional costs in support of developing align s commercial operations 
additionally  we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in subsequent periods due to supporting these sales and marketing requirements and the added costs of ensuring our new align business complies with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents stock based compensation expenses we adopted fas r on january  using the modified prospective application method 
previously we recognized stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees or apb no 
prior period figures have not been restated and therefore are not comparable to the current year presentation 
stock based compensation expenses includes charges credits related to options issued to employees  directors and non employees

in march  the company assumed an accrued restructuring liability in relation to the bothell manufacturing facility  calculated as the net present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses 
in september  the company entered into an exclusive subleasing agency agreement in an attempt to achieve the successful sublet of the facility 
as a result of the agreement  we recorded an additional provision in the third quarter of of million in recognition of commissions payable upon successful conclusion of a sublease agreement 
for the year ended december   a charge of approximately million has been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the reduced likelihood of any sublet income as a result of a deterioration in commercial real estate market conditions in the bothell area 

table of contents future as of december   the restructuring liability associated with exiting the bothell facility was million accounting for the estimated fair value of the remaining lease payments  net of estimated sub lease income 
the restructuring liability is subject to a variety of assumptions and estimates 
we review these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the accrual if necessary 
these changes can be material 
other income expense the following table summarizes the other income expense for years ended december   and

fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income  net  increased to million in from million in the change in derivative value of million and million  respectively for the year ended december  and is associated with the dividend make whole payment on our outstanding convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
the change in valuation of warrants liability relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february the warrants issued to the investors have been classified as a liability in accordance with eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock

for the year ended december   we recognized the change in the value of warrants of approximately million  as other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in interest income of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   is primarily attributable to higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in as compared to primarily as a result of the receipt of million in net proceeds received from the registered direct financing described above 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million as compared to the same period in during the year ended december  interest expenses resulted primarily from interest associated with a government loan  the principal of which was repaid in the fourth quarter of during interest expense resulted primarily from accretion expense associated with the bothell lease restructuring provision which amounted to approximately million 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in interest income from million in to million in is primarily attributable to higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in following receipt of million in net proceeds of our private placement during the second quarter of and the million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments assumed in the stock purchase 
the increase in interest expense to million in as compared to  in resulted primarily from accretion expense associated with the bothell lease restructuring provision 
during the year ended december  we recognized accretion expense of million 
no such accretion expense was recognized in the year ended december  
table of contents the future the valuation of the warrant liability will continue to be re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the valuation of the warrants is dependent upon many factors  including our stock price  and may fluctuate significantly  which may have a significant impact on our statement of operations 
a further accretion expense of approximately million associated with the bothell lease restructuring charge will be recognized over the remaining life of the lease through november income tax benefit credit is taken for research and development tax credits  which are claimed from the united kingdom s taxation and customs authority  in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred

since our inception  we have not generated any significant revenues and have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of equity and preferred securities to finance our operations and internal growth 
additional funding has come through interest on investments  licensing revenue  government grants and 
table of contents research and development tax credits 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that existing funds together with cash generated from the revenues of align and financing activities are sufficient to satisfy our planned working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and other financial commitments through to at least the next months 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as compared with million at december  this higher balance at december  was primarily due to the february registered direct financing of million in gross proceeds

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
while we expect to receive modest product revenues from align we cannot guarantee that we will generate any additional product revenues until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and proceeds from the private placement will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next months 
consequently  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our operations 
we cannot be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain a ccess to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to

in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to us 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the judgments and estimates required by the following accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we have adopted the following revenue recognition policy related to the sales of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
we recognize revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
as we offer a general right of return on these product sales  we must consider the guidance in fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists or fas and staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition or sab under these pronouncements  we account for all product sales using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue is not recognized upon shipment of product to distributors 
instead  upon the ship ment of product to distributors  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and deferred cost of sales at the cost at which those goods were held in inventory 
we recognize revenue when such inventory is sold through to the end user based upon prescriptions filled 
to estimate product sold through to end users  we rely on third party information  including information obtained from certain distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers  and third party market research data 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted fas r using the modified prospective application method 
under sfas r  the fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation must be recognized as expense in the statements of operations over the requisite service period of each award 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the anticipated exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
warrants liability february financing eitf requires freestanding contracts that are settled in our own stock  including common stock warrants to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or liability 
under the provisions of eitf  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value until exercised or expired  with any changes in fair value recorded in the results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no subsequent fair value adjustments are required 
we review the classification of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
pursuant to eitf  since we are 
table of contents unable to control all the events or actions necessary to settle the warrants in registered shares the warrants have been recorded as a current liability at fair value 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
the change in fair value recognized in the financial statements during was million with regards to the february financing 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the business combination

under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if there are indicators such assets may be impaired for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
there were no triggering events calling into question the recoverability of goodwill during recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb ratified the consensus reached by eitf on eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements or eitf eitf requires collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
further  eitf clarified that the determination of whether transactions within a collaborative arrangement are part of a vendor customer or analogous relationship subject to eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products

fas 
fas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
fas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
fas r and fas are effective for both public and private companies for fiscal years beginning on or after december  for the company 
fas r will be applied prospectively 
fas requires retroactive adoption of t he presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements of fas will be applied prospectively

 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities or eitf eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective for us beginning on january  given a review of our current contracts and arrangements the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

in september  the fasb issued fas no

the fasb partially deferred the effective date of fas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis while the effective date for nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities that are recognized on a recurring basis is effective beginning january  the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements based on our current and forecasted business activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our short term investments as of december  consisted of million in corporate bonds and million in federal agency obligations with contractual maturities of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that our exposure to market interest rate fluctuations is minimal 
the corporate bonds in which we invest are rated a or better by both moody s and standard and poor s 
our cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in highly liquid money market accounts 
a hypothetical change in short term interest rates from those in effect at december  would not have a significant impact on our financial position or our expected results of operations 
we do not currently hold any derivative financial instruments with interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations related to the operation of our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
at the end of each reporting period  income and expenses of the subsidiary are remeasured into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period and assets and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars using either historical rates or the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
we currently do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging  however  we have entered into certain contracts denominated in foreign currencies and  therefore  we are subject to currency exchange risks 
as of december  differences on foreign currency translation of million are shown as a movement in other comprehensive income 
in the year ended december  exchange rate differences of million were charged in the consolidated statements of operations 
common stock price risk in february  we issued common stock and warrants 
pursuant to eitf  we recorded the fair value of the warrants as a current liability 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the change in fair value recognized in the financial statements during was million  respectively 
fair value of the derivative instruments will be affected by estimates of various factors that may affect the respective instrument  including our stock price  the risk free rate of return and expected volatility in the fair value of our stock price 
as the fair value of this derivative may fluctuate significantly from period to period  the resulting change in valuation may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in december  we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge  in which kingsbridge committed to provide us up to million of capital during the next three years 
under the terms of the agreement  we will determine the exact timing and amount of any common stock issues  subject to certain conditions
