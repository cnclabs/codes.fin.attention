item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction celgene corporation and its subsidiaries collectively we or our is a global biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases 
our primary commercial stage products include revlimid and thalomid 
revlimid is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved by the fda  the european commission  or ec  swissmedic and the australian therapeutic goods administration for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
revlimid is also approved by the fda and canadian therapeutic products directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk mds  associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities 
thalomid was approved by the fda in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and for the treatment of acute cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum  or enl  and as maintenance therapy for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of enl recurrence 
over the past several years  we have made substantial investments in research and development and the drug candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development 
these candidates include our imids compounds  which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties in addition to our leading oral anti inflammatory agents 
we believe that our primary commercial stage products and depth of our product pipeline provide the catalysts for our future growth 
factors affecting future results future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates  the timing and market acceptance of new products launched 
table of contents by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones  challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs 
see also the risk factors discussion contained in part i  item a 
some of the more signficant factors that we are focused on include the ability of revlimid to successfully penetrate and expand in relevant markets  our ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs and competitive risks 
the ability of revlimid to successfully penetrate and expand in relevant markets the introduction of revlimid in the united states has included among other things  registering physicians in the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of revlimid and partnering with contracted pharmacies to ensure  to the maximum extent possible  safe and rapid distribution of revlimid 
in international markets  revlimid was granted approval by the european commission  swissmedic  canadian therapeutic products directorate and australian therapeutic goods administration with product launches already initiated in several of the approved countries 
we are also continuing to work with the appropriate regulatory authorities to determine next steps for pricing  reimbursement and distribution in those countries in which revlimid has not yet been launched 
we do not have long term data on the use of revlimid and cannot predict whether revlimid will continue to gain widespread acceptance from regulators  physicians  patients  opinion leaders  government health agencies and private health plans 
the ability to advance regulatory and clinical programs a marketing authorization application  or maa  seeking approval to market revlimid for treatment of transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities was evaluated by the european medicines agency s  or emea  committee for medicinal products for human use  or chmp and a negative opinion issued in january the chmp concluded that lenalidomide is efficacious in patients suffering from deletion q mds 
based on information available to the chmp from the uncontrolled  open label  patient phase ii study mds  the chmp was not convinced the data were sufficient to assure safety 
we intend to apply for a reexamination of the chmp opinion in accordance with relevant emea procedures 
other international regulatory initiatives include maa s under evaluation in new zealand and israel 
in april  the eastern cooperative oncology group reported that its data monitoring committee s review of preliminary results from a large  randomized clinical trial for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma found that the use of a low dose of dexamethasone in combination with revlimid suggests survival advantage for patients when compared to the higher  standard dose of dexamethasone that is used in combination with revlimid to treat the disease 
these results were also presented at the june annual american society of clinical oncology medical conference and updated at the december annual american society of hematology meeting 
the regulatory utility of these findings will be discussed with the fda 
a major objective of our on going clinical programs is to broaden our knowledge about the full potential of revlimid and our other proprietary imids compounds and to continue to evaluate them in a broad range of hematological malignancies and other cancers 
our near term focus is on evaluating revlimid as a treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  and aggressive non hodgkin s lymphomas  or nhl 
in november  revlimid was granted orphan medicinal product designation by the ec for treatment of cll 
competitive risks while competition could limit revlimid and thalomid sales  we do not believe that competing products would eliminate their use entirely 
moreover  while generic competitors could seek to challenge our thalomid franchise  we own intellectual property which includes  for example  us patents covering our steps distribution program for the safe distribution and appropriate use of thalidomide  which all physicians  patients and pharmacies prescribing  receiving or dispensing thalidomide in the united states must follow 
we also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering the use of thalomid in oncology and other therapeutic areas 

table of contents company background in  we were spun off from celanese corporation and  in july  we completed an initial public offering 
initially  our operations involved research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
between and  our revenues were derived primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development 
by  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and  in january  we sold the chiral intermediates business to cambrex corporation 
in july  we received our first approval for thalomid from the fda which allowed us to market thalomid for the treatment and suppression of enl  an inflammatory complication of leprosy 
in may  the fda approved thalomid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
in april  we entered into a development and license agreement with novartis pharma ag in which we granted to novartis an exclusive worldwide license to further develop and market focalin tm  our chirally pure version of ritalin 
the agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the regulatory approval process 
under the agreement  we sell focalin tm to novartis as well as receive royalties on all of novartis sales of focalin xr tm and ritalin family of adhd related products 
in august  we acquired signal pharmaceuticals  inc  currently known as signal pharmaceuticals llc  d b a celgene research san diego  a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease 
in november  we licensed to pharmion corporation exclusive rights relating to the development and commercial use of our intellectual property covering thalidomide and steps in all countries outside of north america  japan  china  taiwan and korea see our references below to the december amendment with respect to these territories 
in december  we acquired anthrogenesis corp  which was a privately held new jersey based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business developing technologies for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissues following the completion of full term  successful pregnancies 
anthrogenesis  d b a celgene cellular therapeutics  or cct  now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of celgene corporation  engaged in the research  recovery  culture expansion  preservation  development and distribution of placental stem cells as therapeutic agents 
in march  we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  to distribute  promote and sell alkeran  or melphalan  a therapy approved by the fda for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary 
the agreement requires that we purchase alkeran from gsk and distribute the products in the united states under the celgene label 
the agreement has been extended through march  in october  we acquired penn t limited  or penn t  a supplier of thalomid 
through manufacturing agreements acquired in the transaction  we are able to control manufacturing for thalomid 
in the transaction  we also acquired a product supply agreement to exclusively supply pharmion with thalidomide  thereby enabling us to increase our participation in thalidomide sales in key international markets 
subsequently  in december  we amended the thalidomide supply agreement with pharmion and granted them license rights in additional territories 
as amended  the territory licensed to pharmion is for all countries other than the united states  canada  mexico  japan and china  excluding hong kong 
in december  the fda approved revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and  in june  the fda approved revlimid for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple 
table of contents myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
in june  revlimid was granted full marketing authorization by the ec for use in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and in september  approval was granted by swissmedic and in january by the australian drug evaluation committee for use in this same indication 
in november the ec granted revlimid orphan medicinal product designation for treatment of cll 
in addition  in january  revlimid was approved by the canadian therapeutic products directorate for treatment of patients with mds  associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities 
in november  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share with net proceeds of billion 
in december  we purchased an api manufacturing facility and certain assets and liabilities from siegfried located in zofingen  switzerland 
the api facility has the capability to produce multiple drug substances and is being used to produce revlimid and thalomid api to supply global markets 
the facility also may be used to produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates 
in november  we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire pharmion corporation 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of pharmion common stock for per share payable in a combination of cash and shares of celgene common stock 
the transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of the acquisition by pharmion stockholders and receipt of antitrust clearances 
the hart scott rodino act  or hsr  thirty day waiting period has expired without the united states federal trade commission  or ftc  requesting additional information with regard to the merger 
in addition  the bundeskartellamt  germany s federal cartel office in charge of reviewing the antitrust aspects of mergers and acquisitions  has cleared celgene s pending acquisition of pharmion corporation 
on february  the form s relating to the merger of pharmion and celgene was declared effective by the sec

results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue total revenue and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows change versus versus in thousands net product sales revlimid    n a thalomid alkeran focalin tm other total net product sales collaborative agreements and other revenue royalty revenue total revenue 
table of contents net product sales compared to revlimid net sales increased in compared to primarily due to the product s expanded use in the united states resulting from the fda s june approval for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy in multiple myeloma and growth in europe resulting from the june european commission s approval for the use of revlimid in this same indication 
also contributing to the increase in sales were price increases and increased sales from our european named patient program  or npp  which offers european patients in need of treatment access to revlimid on a compassionate use basis 
net sales of thalomid were higher in compared to primarily due to price increases  partly offset by lower sales volumes as prescriptions written declined  reflecting the expanded use of revlimid 
alkeran net sales were higher in compared to primarily due to increased prices and a decrease in product returns 
compared to in  net sales of revlimid were driven primarily by the december fda approval for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and the june approval for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy 
revlimid net sales recorded in related to initial stocking at certain contracted pharmacies following the product s approval on december  thalomid net sales were higher in compared to primarily due to the fda s may approval for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
price increases implemented as we shifted towards a cost of therapy pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram basis also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting the increase in thalomid sales were sales volume decreases and higher gross to net sales adjustments 
alkeran net sales were slightly higher in  compared to as sales benefited from an increase in alkeran tablet sales volumes  as well as price increases implemented during  particularly in alkeran ivs injectables 
largely offsetting the increase in sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and distributor chargebacks 
sales of focalin tm  which is sold exclusively to novartis and is dependent on the timing of orders from novartis for their commercial distribution  were higher in  compared to  due to increased end market demand 
gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  sales discounts  medicaid rebates and distributor charge backs and service fees 
we base our sales returns allowance  which primarily relates to thalomid  on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  actual returns history and other known factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned and inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
we do not use information from external sources in estimating our product returns 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
revlimid is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
sales discounts accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate amount formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 

table of contents distributor charge back accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor services accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
see critical accounting policies for further discussion 
gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended december   and were as follows returns distributor and medicaid chargebacks allowances discounts rebates and services total in thousands balance at december  allowances for sales during allowances for sales during prior periods credits issued for prior year sales credits issued for sales during balance at december  allowances for sales during allowances for sales during prior periods credits issued for prior year sales credits issued for sales during balance at december  allowances for sales during allowances adjustments for sales during prior periods credits issued for prior year sales credits issued for sales during balance at december  compared to sales return allowances decreased in compared to due primarily to lower returns of alkeran iv resulting from improved expiration dating on and product sales 
in addition  thalomid returns were lower than the prior year primarily due to a thalomid returns initiative undertaken by one large retail pharmacy chain 
in response to this initiative  we introduced single sleeves of thalomid for sale in june of previously  thalomid was sold only in multi sleeve package configurations 
the additional trade package configuration enabled all retailers to more efficiently manage their thalomid inventories resulting in lower returns 
this decrease was partly offset by current year thalomid returns  reflecting the impact of a inventory centralization and rationalization initiative conducted by several major pharmacy chains 
under this initiative  inventory was redistributed amongst individual chain stores in a steps compliant manner 
this resulted in an increase in thalomid returns as these major pharmacy chains more effectively managed their inventory levels at the chain stores 
discounts increased in compared to due primarily to increased sales of revlimid 
medicaid rebate allowances increased in compared to due to increased sales of revlimid as well as price increases for both thalomid and revlimid 
our medicaid rebate accruals are based on the medicaid unit rebate amount formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services using the estimated medicaid dispense quantities 
revlimid dispenses increased resulting from the introduction of the mg and mg strength tablets 

table of contents distributor chargebacks increased in compared to primarily due to revlimid  thalomid and alkeran iv price increases  which increased the differential between annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers and our wholesale acquisition cost 
compared to sales returns allowances increased in  compared to  primarily due to unusually high thalomid returns from one specific large retail pharmacy chain  which occurred during the first half of the returns from this customer were the results of its efforts to more aggressively manage inventory  our package configuration which required pharmacies to purchase full cartons of up to ten sleeves of thalomid capsules with each order and steps related restrictions  which limited the customer s ability to transfer inventories between its locations 
for the past several years  we have experienced sales returns of approximately of sales 
as a result of the higher returns activity during the first half of  we recorded additional allowances to increase our reserve to approximately of all estimated thalomid pharmacy inventories 
in addition  we introduced single sleeve units  beginning june  rather than requiring full carton purchases and we amended our product returns policy to include a product returns handling fee 
these measures were designed to allow customers to more effectively manage their inventories  since they can now order smaller quantities  as well as limit our product returns exposure 
to a lesser extent  the increase in sales returns allowances also resulted from higher returns of expired alkeran iv product 
sales discounts increased in  compared to  due to higher net sales 
medicaid rebate allowances decreased in  compared to  primarily due to the impact of the new medicare part d legislation  which became effective january  as a result of the new legislation  many patients who had been eligible to receive thalomid through medicaid coverage are now covered under medicare part d 
partially offsetting the thalomid decrease are medicaid rebate allowances included in for revlimid sales 
distributor chargebacks increased in  compared to  primarily due to thalomid price increases  which increased the differential between annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers and our wholesale acquisition cost 
also contributing to the increase in distributor chargeback allowances was an increase in alkeran iv sales to certain public health services contract eligible customers and accruals for revlimid  which was approved in the us in december other revenues compared to revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in license fees generated from our steps program and an increase in umbilical cord blood enrollment  collection and storage fees generated through our lifebank usasm business 
royalty revenue totaled million in  representing an increase of million compared to the increase was primarily due to amounts received from novartis on sales of their entire family of ritalin drugs and focalin xr tm 
compared to revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources totaled million in  compared to million in the million decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in of a million milestone payment received from novartis relating to the fda marketing approval for focalin xr tm

table of contents cost of goods sold cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands cost of goods sold increase from prior year percentage increase from prior year percentage of net product sales compared to cost of goods sold increased in compared to primarily due to increases in revlimid material costs and royalty payments related to both revlimid and thalomid as sales increased for these two products 
the increase was partly offset by lower alkeran material costs related to alkeran for injection 
as a percentage of net product sales  cost of goods sold decreased from in and in to in primarily due to the growth of revlimid  the product s lower cost relative to our other products and sales price increases 
compared to cost of goods sold was higher in compared to primarily due to higher alkeran costs 
alkeran costs tend to experience variability depending on the purchase price of the specific units sold during a given period 
also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold were higher royalties on thalomid which resulted from higher net sales and the inclusion of costs associated with revlimid sales 
research and development research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands research and development increase from prior year percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenue compared to research and development expenses increased by million in compared to primarily due to spending related to clinical research and development in support of multiple programs  including revlimid and other imids across a broad range of cancers  including nhl and cll 
expenses also increased to support ongoing research of other compounds  such as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental derived stem progenitor cell program 
regulatory spending increased primarily due to the expansion of revlimid in international markets 
the expense for also included a combined million in collaborative research and development arrangements for early stage compounds with array biopharma inc and ptc therapeutics 
in  research and development expenses consisted of million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  including million for collaborative research and development arrangements  million spent on other pharmaceutical programs  including toxicology  analytical research and development  drug discovery  quality and regulatory affairs  million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs 
these expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for revlimid and thalomid  and for other compounds such as cc  our lead anti inflammatory compound that inhibits pde  which results in the inhibition of multiple proinflammatory mediators such as tnf and which is currently being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis  cc  cc and cc which are currently either being evaluated in phase i clinical trials or for which phase ii clinical trials are planned or ongoing  and our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs as well as the placental stem cell program

in  we spent million on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  million on other pharmaceutical programs  including toxicology  analytical research and development  drug discovery  quality and regulatory affairs  million on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs 
research and development expense may continue to grow as earlier stage compounds are moved through the preclinical and clinical stages 
due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects  the cost to complete such projects can vary 
the data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent a project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development  which would significantly impact the costs incurred to bring a project to completion

eitf will be effective for us beginning january on a retrospective basis 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of eitf will have  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition on collaboration agreements we have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements 
the agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events  and in some cases ongoing research funding 
the agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compounds receive regulatory marketing approval 
our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  or sab in addition  we follow the provisions of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  eitf provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities can be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  nonrefundable upfront license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on 
table of contents a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is nonrefundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  we would recognize a proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that correlates to work already performed and the remaining portion of the milestone payment will be deferred and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and chargebacks our gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and chargebacks are based on our sales and or estimates of third party inventories 
our accrual methodologies are described in more detail below 
thalomid is distributed under our steps distribution program 
among other things  steps  which is a proprietary comprehensive education and risk management distribution program  requires prescribers  patients and dispensing pharmacies to participate in a registry and prohibits the filling of a thalomid order unless the physician  patient and pharmacy have all obtained an appropriate authorization number 
automatic refills are not permitted under the program 
each prescription may not exceed a day supply and a new prescription is required with each order 
although we invoice through traditional pharmaceutical wholesalers  all thalomid orders are drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy overnight 
wholesaler stocking of this product is prohibited 
in addition  we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to pharmacies or hospitals and  therefore  have no commercial distributor chargebacks 
revlimid is distributed under the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of revlimid  and is sold primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel 
the revassist program includes most of the same attributes of the steps program mentioned above 
alkeran is distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain 
alkeran is not subjected to steps or revassist distribution restrictions 
it may be stocked by multiple wholesalers and prescribed by physicians without our preauthorization 
sales returns we base our sales returns allowance  which primarily relates to thalomid  on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  actual returns history and other known factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned and inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
we do not use information from external sources in estimating our product returns 
as indicated above  thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
revlimid is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
external factors such as price changes from competitors and introductions of new and generic competing products could have an impact on our sales returns 
our sales returns have not been impacted thus far by such external factors  however  we continue to monitor such factors 
our sales returns allowances were million  million and million in  and  respectively  which equates to an accrual rate of 
table of contents  and of gross product sales in each of the three respective years 
a increase in our returns rate would have resulted in a million decrease in our reported revenue 
medicaid rebates our medicaid rebate accruals are computed using the medicaid rebate formula established by the center for medicare and medicaid services 
this formula establishes a quarterly unit rebate amount ura for eligible drugs based on our quarterly average manufacturers price amp 
we apply the calculated amp to estimated quarterly medicaid dispense quantities for our products 
actual medicaid dispense quantities are reported by individual states on a day quarter end lag 
differences in medicaid rebate accruals resulting from differences in the estimated medicaid dispense quantities and actual medicaid dispense quantities are adjusted in the following period 
the ura calculation allows for manufacturer price increases based on increases in the consumer price index all urban consumers 
price increases in excess of the allowable medicaid increase result in a higher unit rebate amount 
our medicaid rebate allowances increased in compared to due primarily to increased sales of revlimid as well as price increases for both thalomid and revlimid above the allowable medicaid increase 
distributor chargebacks as indicated above  we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to pharmacies or hospitals and  therefore  have no commercial distributor chargebacks 
our distributor chargebacks result from the difference between prices paid by the wholesaler to acquire our products and the lower prices the wholesaler is legally obligated to extend to federally funded healthcare providers such as veterans affairs and department of defense entities as well as non federal phs b entities 
we estimate distributor chargeback allowances at the time of sale based on the pharmacies to which the order was drop shipped and its eligibility for the lower pricing 
actual chargeback credits claimed by the wholesaler may significantly differ from our accruals 
thalomid chargeback allowances are more sensitive to current price changes due to the cumulative increase to the thalomid wholesale acquisition price since its initial commercial launch date 
revlimid chargeback allowances are less sensitive to current wholesale acquisition cost price increases due to its relatively recent commercial launch date 
other gross to net sales accruals we record sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to customers and we record distributor services accruals based on contractual fees incurred for the wholesale distributor services provided 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our effective tax rate is approximately 
the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory tax rate primarily due to certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the united states for which we do not presently receive a tax benefit and nondeductible expenses which include share based compensation expense related to incentive stock options 
we operate under an incentive tax holiday in switzerland that expires in and exempts us from certain swiss taxes 
likewise  expenses currently being incurred in switzerland do not provide a tax benefit 
to the extent we receive approvals in markets outside the united states  and manufacture and generate taxable income subject to our swiss tax holiday  we would expect our effective tax rate to be lower in the future 
we adopted the provisions of fin and fsp fin effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we had no cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption 
we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public 
table of contents actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results could be materially impacted 
at march   we determined it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets and  as a result  eliminated certain deferred tax valuation allowances  which resulted in us recording an income tax benefit in of million and an increase to additional paid in capital of million 
the decision to eliminate the deferred tax valuation allowances was based on an external independent data monitoring committee s  or idmc  analysis of two phase iii special protocol assessment multiple myeloma trials and the conclusion that these trials exceeded the pre specified stopping rule 
the idmc found a statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression the primary endpoint of these phase iii trials in patients receiving revlimid plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone alone 
this  in concert with our nine consecutive quarters of profitability  led to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
at december   it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
share based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  effective january   which requires that all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized over the remaining service period after the adoption date for additional information refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
during and  we determined that certain securities had sustained other than temporary impairments and  as a result  we recognized impairment losses of million and million in and  respectively  which were recorded in interest and investment income  net 

table of contents investment in affiliated companies our investment in affiliated companies includes an investment in entremed which had a carrying value of million and a fair value of million at december  if the carrying value of our investment were to exceed its fair value  we would review it to determine if an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained 
if the investment is determined to have sustained an other than temporary decline in value  the investment will be written down to its fair value 
such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that we consider in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the period of time that the market value is below cost  the financial condition of the investee and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
we evaluate information that we are aware of in addition to quoted market prices  if any  in determining if an other than temporary decline in value exists 
accounting for long term incentive plans we have established a long term incentive plan  or ltip  designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period 
we currently have three three year performance cycles running concurrently ending december   and the performance cycle was approved by the management compensation and development committee of the board of directors in february and began on january  with an ending date of december  performance measures for each ltip are based on the following components in the last year of the three year cycle on earnings per share  on net income and on revenue 
payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the  and plans 
the estimated payout for the concluded cycle is million and the maximum potential payout  assuming objectives are achieved at the maximum level for the  and cycles  are million  million and million  respectively 
such awards are payable in cash or  at our discretion  in our common stock based upon our stock price at the payout date 
we accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or  if higher  an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control 
for  and  we recognized expense related to the ltip of million  million and million  respectively 
accruals recorded for the ltip entail making certain assumptions concerning future earnings per share  net income and revenues  the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used 
accruals for the ltip are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts 
in estimating the accruals  management considers actual results to date for the performance period  expected results for the remainder of the performance period  operating trends  product development  pricing and competition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at december   our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of derivatives  marketable securities available for sale  unsecured convertible notes issued by us and our notes payable to siegfried 
derivatives we periodically utilize forward contracts to economically hedge non functional currency exposures 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge non 
table of contents functional currency assets denominated in swiss francs  british pounds  japanese yen and us dollars 
the aggregate notional amount of these contracts was million and they expire within one year 
the contracts are hedges of receivables at uk and swiss foreign entities and are remeasured through earnings each period along with the underlying hedged item 
at december   the net unrealized gain on the forward contracts was approximately million in the aggregate 
although not predictive in nature  we believe a hypothetical threshold reflects a reasonably possible near term change in foreign currency rates 
assuming that the year end exchange rates were to adversely change by a hypothetical decrease in the underlying currencies  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately million 
however  since the contracts hedge assets denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency  any change in the fair value of the contract would be offset by a change in the underlying value of the hedged items 
marketable securities available for sale at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted of us treasury securities  us government sponsored agency securities  mortgage backed obligations  corporate debt securities and  shares of pharmion corporation common stock 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  held for an unspecified period of time and intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses  is included in interest and investment income  net 
as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows duration less than more than year to years to years years total in thousands principal amount fair value average interest rate pharmion common stock at december   we held a total of  shares of pharmion corporation common stock  which had an estimated fair value of approximately million based on the closing price reported by the national association of securities dealers automated quotations  or nasdaq  and  which exceeded the cost by approximately million 
the amount by which the fair value exceeded the cost ie  the unrealized gain was included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the pharmion common stock investment is subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease in pharmion s common stock quoted market price will have a similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the proposed merger with pharmion 
convertible debt in june  we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of unsecured convertible notes 
the convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of payable semi annually 
the convertible notes outstanding at december  can be converted at any time into  shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of per share for more information refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of million by approximately million  which we believe reflects the increase in the market price of our common stock to per share as of december  assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally results in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value  and an increase in our stock price generally results in an increase in the fair value of convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value 

table of contents note payable at december   the fair value of our note payable to siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note of million 
assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the note 
the fair value of the note will also be affected by changes in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
the note is denominated in swiss francs
