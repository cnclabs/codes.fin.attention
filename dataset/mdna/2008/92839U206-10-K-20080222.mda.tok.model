item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations may be impacted by the factors discussed herein 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued the company s expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors 
changes in the company s debt and capital structure  among other items  may impact its effective tax rate 
the company s overall effective tax rate is equal to consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax 
however  tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional basis 
further  the company is in a position whereby losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions generally provide no current financial statement benefit 
in addition  certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the united states statutory rate 
as such  changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on the company s overall effective tax rate in future periods 
changes in tax law and rates  changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes  or adverse outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process in any of the jurisdictions in which the company operates could also have a significant impact on the company s overall effective rate in future periods 
if visteon were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  under current conditions  its annual federal net operating loss nol utilization could be limited to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long term tax exempt rate 
visteon cannot provide any assurance that such an ownership change will not occur  in which case the availability of visteon s substantial nol carryforward and other federal income tax attributes would be significantly limited or possibly eliminated 
the company s ability to effectively operate could be hindered if it fails to attract and retain key personnel 
the company s ability to operate its business and implement its strategies effectively depends  in part  on the efforts of its executive officers and other key employees 
in addition  the company s future success will depend on  among other factors  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  particularly engineers and other employees with critical expertise and skills that support key customers and products 
the loss of the services of any key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s international operations  including asian joint ventures  are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has operating facilities  and conducts a significant portion of its business  outside the united states 
the company has invested significantly in joint ventures with other parties to conduct business in south korea  china and elsewhere in asia 
the company s ability to repatriate funds from these joint ventures depends not only upon their uncertain cash flows and profits  but also upon the terms of particular agreements with the company s joint venture partners and maintenance of the legal and political status quo 
the company risks expropriation in china and the instability that would accompany civil unrest or armed conflict within the asian region 
more generally  the company s asian joint ventures and other foreign investments could be adversely affected by changes in the political  economic and financial environments in host countries  including fluctuations in exchange rates  political instability  changes in foreign laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations and changes in trade policies  import and export restrictions and tariffs  taxes and exchange controls 
any one of these factors could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and require translation adjustments  which can be significant  for purposes of reporting results from  and the financial condition of  its foreign investments 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued warranty claims  product liability claims and product recalls could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company faces inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that its products fail to perform as expected or such failure results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of the company s designed products are defective or are alleged to be defective  the company may be required to participate in a recall campaign 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  automakers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against the company in excess of its available insurance coverage and established reserves  or a requirement that the company participate in a product recall campaign  would have adverse effects that could be material on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes  which could have an adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial position 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that  from time to time  are significant 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes including disputes with suppliers  intellectual property matters  personal injury claims and employment matters 
in addition  the company  certain directors  officers and employees have been named in lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws  erisa and fiduciary obligations 
no assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the company s profitability and financial position 
the company could be adversely impacted by environmental laws and regulations 
the company s operations are subject to us and us environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to air  discharges to water  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
currently  environmental costs with respect to former  existing or subsequently acquired operations are not material  but there is no assurance that the company will not be adversely impacted by such costs  liabilities or claims in the future either under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 
developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact its business 
the company owns significant intellectual property  including a large number of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets  and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements 
the company s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position in a number of the markets served 
developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact the business 
significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations and financial condition 
the company s business and results of operations could be affected adversely by terrorism 
terrorist sponsored attacks  both foreign and domestic  could have adverse effects on the company s business and results of operations 
these attacks could accelerate or exacerbate other automotive industry risks such as those described above and also have the potential to interfere with the company s business by disrupting supply chains and the delivery of products to customers 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued a failure of the company s internal controls could adversely affect the company s ability to report its financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
as a result  the company s business  operating results and liquidity could be harmed 
because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud  even an effective system of internal control may not prevent or detect all misstatements 
in the event of an internal control failure  the company s ability to report its financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely impacted  which could result in a loss of investor confidence in its financial reports or have a material adverse affect on the company s ability to operate its business or access sources of liquidity

in july  the public employees retirement system of mississippi was appointed as lead plaintiff in this matter 
in september  the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint  which alleges  among other things  that the company and its independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  made misleading statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made  in light of the circumstances under which they were made  not misleading 
the named plaintiff seeks to represent a class consisting of purchasers of the company s securities during the period between june  and january  class action status has not yet been certified in this litigation

as is customary in derivative suits  the company has been named as a defendant in these actions 
as a nominal defendant  the company is not liable for any damages in these suits nor is any specific relief sought against the company 
the complaints allege that  among other things  the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties of good faith and loyalty and aided and abetted such breaches during the period between january  and january  in connection with the company s conduct concerning  among other things  the matters alleged in the securities class action discussed immediately above 
on february  the court approved the settlement of the shareholder derivative suits and ordered their dismissal with prejudice 
pursuant to the settlement  the company will  among other things  pay for the defendants attorneys fees and expenses in the amount of  the company and its current and former directors and officers intend to contest the foregoing lawsuit vigorously 
however  at this time the company is not able to predict with certainty the final outcome of the foregoing lawsuit or its potential exposure with respect to such lawsuit 
in the event of an unfavorable resolution of these matters  the company s financial results and cash flows in one or more periods could be materially affected to the extent any such loss is not covered by insurance or applicable reserves 
other matters various other legal actions  governmental investigations and proceedings and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against the company  including those arising out of alleged defects in the company s products  governmental regulations relating to safety  employment related matters  customer  supplier and other contractual relationships  intellectual property rights  product warranties  product recalls  and environmental matters

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross margin the company s gross margin was million in  compared with million in  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease in gross margin was attributable to lower ford and nissan production volumes in north america and unfavorable product mix  primarily at the company s electronics facilities  partially offset by higher ford europe volumes and net new business in asia 
additionally  the non recurrence of cost benefits  including postretirement benefit relief resulting from the assumption of such obligation by ford related to company employees transferred to ford in connection with two ach manufacturing facilities  reduced gross margin 
these reductions were offset by cost efficiencies achieved through manufacturing  purchasing  and ongoing restructuring efforts 
the company continues to take actions to lower its manufacturing costs by increasing its focus on production utilization and related investment  closure and consolidation of facilities and relocation of production to lower cost environments to take further advantage of its global manufacturing footprint 
the company has consolidated its regional purchasing activities into a global commodity driven organization to provide increased spending leverage and to further standardize its production and related material purchases

the company continues to evaluate alternative courses of action related to the remaining facilities  including the possibility of divestiture  closure or renegotiated commercial and or labor arrangements 
however  there is no assurance that a transaction or other arrangement will occur in the near term or at all 
the company s ultimate course of action for these facilities will be dependent upon that which provides the greatest long term return to shareholders 
as the company executes its multi year improvement plan  related general and administrative functions are being fundamentally reorganized to effectively and efficiently support the company s restructured business 
additionally  the company continues to reduce engineering costs through relocation of its engineering capability to more competitive cost locations

the company estimates that the total cash cost associated with the multi year improvement plan will be approximately million

the company expects that approximately million of cash costs incurred under the multi year improvement plan will be reimbursed from the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement 
it is possible that actual cash restructuring costs could vary significantly from the company s estimates resulting in unexpected costs in future periods 
generally  charges are recorded as elements of the plan are finalized and the timing of activities and the amount of related costs are not likely to change 
while the company continues its efforts to improve its operations  restructure its business  and achieve profitable growth  there can be no assurances that the results of these efforts alone will be sufficient to address the impact of current industry and market trends

the proceeds from these bond issuances  combined with existing cash balances  were used to subscribe for an ownership interest in a newly formed korean company that holds interests in certain of the company s climate control operations in india  china and the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as included in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the company s significant accounting policies have been disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes under note the company provides enhanced information that supplements such disclosures for accounting estimates when the estimate involves matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates or changes to an estimate could have a material impact on the reported financial position  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that it considers to be the most appropriate given the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties 
estimates are typically based upon historical experience  current trends  contractual documentation  and other information  as appropriate 
due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates  actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements 
pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions  the company s defined benefit pension and non pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively  and as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
disability  early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer accounting for postemployment benefits 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits  such as retiree health care and life insurance  is dependent on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
selected assumptions are described in note employee retirement benefits to the company s consolidated financial statements  which are incorporated herein by reference  including the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  accordingly  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
therefore  assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods 
the primary assumptions affecting the company s accounting for employee benefits under sfas nos 
  and as of december  are as follows long term rate of return on plan assets the expected long term rate of return is used to calculate net periodic pension cost 
the required use of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long term returns 
the expected long term rate of return for pension assets has been chosen based on various inputs  including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company s trusts and its asset allocation  as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market returns  inflation and other variables 
in determining its pension expense for  the company used long term rates of return on plan assets ranging from to outside the us and in the us actual returns on us pension assets for  and were  and  respectively  compared to the expected rate of return assumption of  and respectively  for each of those years 
the company s market related value of pension assets reflects changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period  with a one third weighting to the most recent year 
discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations 
the discount rate assumption is based on market rates for a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated aa or better with maturities closely matched to the timing of projected benefit payments for each plan at its annual measurement date 
the company used discount rates ranging from to to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december   including weighted average discount rates of for us pension plans  for non us pension plans  and for postretirement employee health care and life insurance plans 
health care cost trend for postretirement employee health care plan accounting  the company reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions 
in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december   the company used health care cost trend rates of  declining to an ultimate trend rate of in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company s pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and us pension plans on its funded status and pre tax pension expense excludes certain salaried employees that are covered by a ford sponsored plan impact on impact on us impact on non us impact on pre tax pension us plan pre tax pension non us plan expense funded status expense funded status basis point decrease in discount rate a million million million million basis point increase in discount rate a million million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets a million million basis point increase in expected return on assets a million million a assumes all other assumptions are held constant

effective october  and in connection with the ach transactions  ford relieved the company of all liabilities associated with postretirement employee health care and life insurance related obligations for visteon assigned ford uaw employees and retirees and for salaried retirees who retired prior to may  the amount of benefit relief pursuant to the ach transactions totaled billion 
the company continues to have a financial obligation to ford for the cost of providing selected health care and life insurance benefits to certain visteon salaried employees who retire after may  the health care and life insurance costs for these employees are calculated using ford s assumptions 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when certain indicators of impairment are present 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
generally  when impairment exists the long lived assets are adjusted to their respective fair values 
in assessing long lived assets for an impairment loss  assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment 
accordingly  facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing 
in assessing long lived assets for impairment  management considered the company s product line portfolio  customers and related commercial agreements  labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent 
additionally  in determining fair value of long lived assets  management uses appraisals  management estimates or discounted cash flow calculations 
product warranty and recall the company accrues for warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates  with support from the company s sales  engineering  quality and legal functions  of the amount that eventually will be required to settle such obligations 
this accrual is based on several factors  including contractual arrangements  past experience  current claims  production changes  industry developments and various other considerations 
the company accrues for product recall claims related to potential financial participation in customers actions to provide remedies related primarily to safety concerns as a result of actual or threatened regulatory or court actions or the company s determination of the potential for such actions 
the company accrues for recall claims for products sold based on management estimates  with support from the company s engineering  quality and legal functions 
amounts accrued are based upon management s best estimate of the amount that will ultimately be required to settle such claims 
environmental matters the company is subject to the requirements of federal  state  local and international environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
these include laws regulating air emissions  water discharge and waste management 
the company is also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties it presently owns or operates and at third party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arranged to send hazardous waste 
at the time of spin off  the company and ford agreed on a division of liability for  and responsibility for management and remediation of  environmental claims existing at that time  and  further  that the company would assume all liabilities for existing and future claims relating to sites that were transferred to it and its operation of those sites  including off site disposal  except as otherwise specifically retained by ford in the master transfer agreement 
in connection with the ach transactions  ford agreed to re assume these liabilities to the extent they arise from the ownership or operation prior to the spin off of the locations transferred to ach excluding any increase in costs attributable to the exacerbation of such liability by the company or its affiliates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is aware of contamination at some of its properties and relating to various third party superfund sites at which the company or its predecessor has been named as a potentially responsible party 
the company is in various stages of investigation and cleanup at these sites 
at december   the company had recorded a reserve of approximately million for this environmental investigation and cleanup 
however  estimating liabilities for environmental investigation and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond the company s control and which may change dramatically 
accordingly  although the company believes its reserve is adequate based on current information  the company cannot provide any assurance that its ultimate environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserve 
income taxes the company  which is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous non us jurisdictions  accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial performance of the entity recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 
uncertain tax positions in the ordinary course of the company s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity overview the company s cash and liquidity needs are impacted by the level  variability  and timing of its customers worldwide vehicle production  which varies based on economic conditions and market shares in major markets 
additionally  the company s cash and liquidity needs are impacted by seasonal factors  including oem shutdown periods and new model year production launches 
these seasonal factors generally require the use of liquidity resources during the first and third quarters 
the company expects to fund its working capital  restructuring and capital expenditure needs with cash flows from operations 
to the extent that the company s liquidity needs exceed cash from operations  the company would look to its cash balances and availability for borrowings to satisfy those needs  as well as the need to raise additional capital 
however  the company s ability to fund its working capital  restructuring and capital expenditure needs may be adversely affected by many factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  specific industry conditions  financial markets  competitive factors and legislative and regulatory changes 
therefore  assurance cannot be provided that visteon will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that available borrowings will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its liquidity needs 
the company s business is highly dependent upon the ability to access the credit and capital markets 
access to  and the costs of borrowing in  these markets depend in part on the company s credit ratings  which are currently below investment grade 
moody s current corporate rating of the company is b  and the sgl rating is the rating on senior unsecured debt is caa with a negative outlook 
the current corporate rating of the company by s p is b and the short term liquidity rating is b  with a negative outlook on the rating 
fitch s current rating on the company s senior secured debt is b with a negative outlook 
any further downgrade in the company s credit ratings could reduce its access to capital  increase the costs of future borrowings  and increase the possibility of more restrictive terms and conditions contained in any new or replacement financing arrangements or commercial agreements or payment terms with suppliers 
additionally  the current state of the credit and capital markets has resulted in severely constrained liquidity conditions owing to a reevaluation of risk attributable primarily  but not limited to  the us sub prime mortgage crisis 
continuation of such constraints may increase the company s costs of borrowing and could restrict the company s access to this potential source of future liquidity 
cash and equivalents as of december  and  the company s consolidated cash balances totaled billion and billion  respectively 
approximately and of these consolidated cash balances are located within the us as of december  and  respectively 
as the company s operating profitability has become more concentrated with its foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures  the company s cash generated from operations and related balances located outside of the us continue to be significant 
the company s ability to efficiently access cash balances in certain foreign jurisdictions is subject to local regulatory and statutory requirements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
to manage these risks  the company uses a combination of fixed price contracts with suppliers  cost sourcing arrangements with customers and financial derivatives 
the company maintains risk management controls to monitor the risks and the related hedging 
derivative positions are examined using analytical techniques such as market value and sensitivity analysis 
derivative instruments are not used for speculative purposes  as per clearly defined risk management policies 
foreign currency risk the company s net cash inflows and outflows exposed to the risk of changes in exchange rates arise from the sale of products in countries other than the manufacturing source  foreign currency denominated supplier payments  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends and investments in subsidiaries 
the company s on going solution is to reduce the exposure through operating actions 
the company s primary foreign exchange operating exposures include the korean won  mexican peso  euro and czech koruna 
the company s operating results are exposed generally to weakening of the euro and to strengthening of the korean won  mexican peso  and czech koruna 
for transactions in these currencies  the company utilizes a strategy of partial coverage 
as of december   the company s coverage for projected transactions in these currencies was approximately for as of december  and  the net fair value of foreign currency forward contracts was a liability of million and an asset of million  respectively 
the hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these estimated changes assume a parallel shift in all currency exchange rates and include the gain or loss on financial instruments used to hedge loans to subsidiaries 
because exchange rates typically do not all move in the same direction  the estimate may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on the net fair value of the company s financial derivatives 
it is also important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
interest rate risk the company monitors its exposure to interest rate risk principally in relation to fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in connection with its risk management policies 
accordingly  the company has entered into certain fixed for variable and variable for fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage such interest rate exposures 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps for a portion of the notes due august  million and a portion of the notes due march  million 
these interest rate swaps effectively convert the designated portions of these notes from fixed interest rate to variable interest rate instruments 
additionally  the company has entered into interest rate swaps for a portion of the billion term loan due million  effectively converting the designated portion of this loan from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate instrument 
approximately and of the company s borrowings were effectively on a fixed rate basis as of december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the net fair value of interest rate swaps were liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value of these swaps from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would be approximately million as of december  and the annual increase in pre tax interest expense from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in variable interest rates including the impact of interest rate swaps would be approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
