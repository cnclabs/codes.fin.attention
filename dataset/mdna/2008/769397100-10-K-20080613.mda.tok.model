critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified three policies  that due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the impairment of investments and the calculation of income taxes 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussions and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  describes generally the company s accounting policies 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is provided based upon management s continuing analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes techniques to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses included in item and in note of the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
investment valuation the company classifies its investments as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
the company had no securities classified as trading at march  securities held to maturity are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  which are recognized in interest income using the interest method 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value 
premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity 
unrealized holding gains and losses  or valuation allowances established for net unrealized losses  are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income taxes 
realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other than temporary are included in earnings 
the company s underlying principle in determining whether impairment is other than temporary is based on positive evidence indicating that an investment s carrying value is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs negative evidence to the contrary 
evidence that is objectively determinable and verifiable is given greater weight than evidence that is subjective and or not verifiable 
evidence based on future events will generally be less objective as it is based on future expectations and therefore is generally less verifiable or not verifiable at all 
factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and c the company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time 
in situations in which the security s fair value is below amortized cost but it continues to be probable that all contractual terms of the security will be satisfied  the decline is solely attributable to changes in interest rates not because of increased credit risk  and the company asserts that it has positive intent and ability to hold that security to maturity  no other than temporary impairment is recognized 
income taxes the company estimates tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position

operating strategy in the fiscal year ended march   the company began to implement a growth strategy to broaden its products and services from those of a traditional thrift to those more closely related to commercial banking 
the growth strategy included four elements geographic and product expansion  loan portfolio diversification  development of relationship banking and maintenance of asset quality 
the april acquisition of american pacific bank added three branches in oregon portland  aumsville and wood village 
during fiscal year  the company also opened in vancouver the riverview center an operations center and the tech center branch 
the riverview center is a  square foot office building where over employees from accounting  audit  data processing  human resources  information technology  loan origination  loan servicing  marketing and operations are located 
the tech center is a full service branch with the convenience of two drive up teller windows  drive up atm and safe deposit boxes

during fiscal year  the company opened a new lending office in clackamas oregon and relocated one of its leased branches in vancouver into a new company owned facility 
the company s growing commercial customer base has enjoyed new products and the improvements in existing products 
these new products include business checking  internet banking  remote check capture  expanded cash management services and new loan products 
retail customers have benefited from expanded choices ranging from additional automated teller machines  consumer lending products  checking accounts  debit cards  hour account information service and internet banking 
fiscal year marked the th anniversary since the bank opened its doors in the historical emphasis had been on residential real estate lending 
however  the company began diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of commercial loans in at march   commercial and construction loans as a percentage of the loan portfolio were  which has increased to of total loans at the end of fiscal year commercial lending including commercial real estate has higher credit risk  wider interest margins and shorter loan terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio s profitability 
the company s relationship banking has been enhanced by the addition of ramcorp  a trust company directed by experienced trust officers  through expanded loan products serviced by experienced commercial and consumer lending officers  and an expanded branch network led by experienced branch managers 
development of relationship banking has been the key to the company s growth 
assets under management by ramcorp 
have increased from million at march   to million at march  comparison of financial condition at march  and at march   the company had total assets of million compared with million at march  the increase in total assets was primarily a result of the increase in the balance of loans outstanding 
cash  including interest earning accounts  totaled million at march   compared to million at march   primarily as a result of the maturity of investment securities  an increase in fhlb advances and the issuance of junior subordinated debentures which were partially offset by an increase in loan production 
investment securities available for sale were million at march   compared to million at march  the decrease was attributable to maturities and scheduled cash flows of securities 
mortgage backed securities available for sale were million at march   compared to million at march  the million decrease was a result of pay downs 
the company does not believe it has any exposure to sub prime mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable  net  was million at march   compared to million at march   a increase 
net loans receivable increased million  or  at march  compared to the previous linked quarter as a result of continued strong loan growth 
a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate  either as primary or secondary collateral  located in the company s primary market area 
risks associated with loans secured by real estate include decreasing land and property values  material increases in interest rates  deterioration in local economic conditions  tightening credit or refinancing markets  and a concentration of loans within any one area 
the company has no sub prime residential real estate loans in its portfolio 
deposit accounts totaled million at march  compared to million at march  as a result of falling interest rates during fiscal year  the company has seen a shift in customer deposit choices from money market deposit and interest checking accounts into certificates of deposit 
as a result  the balance of certificates of deposit increased million to million at march   compared to million at march  junior subordinated debentures totaled million at march  and million at march  the million increase was the result of the issuance of additional trust preferred securities in june fhlb advances increased to million at march  as compared to million at march  the increase was the result of the company s continued strong loan growth and modest deposit growth  due to continued competition for customer deposits 
shareholders equity decreased million to million at march  from million at march  the decrease in equity resulting from cash dividends declared to shareholders of million and stock repurchases of million was partially offset by earnings of million for the year ended march  exercise of stock options  earned esop shares  fin adjustments and the net tax effect of sfas no 
adjustment to securities comprised the remaining  net increase 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted earning share for the year ended march   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to a combination of decreased net interest income and an increase in the provision for loan losses 
net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a decrease  from million in fiscal year the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  which indicates that the interest earning asset growth is being funded more by interest bearing liabilities as compared to capital and non interest bearing demand deposits 
the net interest margin for the fiscal year ended march  was compared to for the same prior year period 
the company s balance sheet interest rate sensitivity achieves better net interest rate margins in a stable or increasing interest rate environment due to the balance sheet being slightly asset interest rate sensitive 
in a decreasing interest rate environment the company requires time to reduce deposit interest rates to recover the decline in the net interest rate margin 
interest rates on the company s interest earning asset reprice down faster than interest rates on the company s interest bearing liabilities 
as a result of the federal reserve s basis point reduction in the short term federal funds rate during the year ended march   approximately of the company s loans immediately repriced down basis points 
the company expects interest rate floors on certain loans to begin slowing asset yield reductions with future interest rate reductions by the federal reserve 
the company also immediately reduced the interest rate paid on certain interest bearing deposits 
further reductions will be reflected in future deposit offering rates 
the amount and timing of these reductions is dependent on competitive pricing pressures  yield curve shape and changes in spreads 
interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million  for the fiscal year ended march  decreases in interest income due to the federal reserve rate cuts described above were partially offset by increases in the average loan balance due to continued strong loan growth 
average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million  a  or increase from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in interest expense is the result of higher rates of interest paid on deposits and borrowings that occurred during the first half of fiscal year the weighted average interest rate of total deposits increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  due to the falling interest rate environment  the mix of deposits has shifted into certificates of deposit 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in the provision for loan losses is the result of increased loan growth  changes in the loan loss rates and a negative trend in the risk rating migration of certain loans 
the risk rating migration largely consisted of land acquisition and development loans and residential construction loans being moved to higher risk rating categories 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments to total net loans was at march   compared to at march  net charge offs for the year ended march  were  compared to net recoveries of  for the same period last year 
the increase in net charge offs is primarily attributable to the charge off of three commercial loans totaling  for the year ended march  annualized net charge offs to average net loans for the year ended march  were  compared to annualized net recoveries of for the same period in the prior year 
management s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing  quarterly assessments of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience with additional consideration and adjustments made for other economic conditions 
management considers the allowance for loan losses at march  to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased  to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period in decreases in mortgage broker loan fees that are reported in fees and service charges were partially offset by an increase in asset management fees 
for the year ended march   broker loan fees decreased by  compared to the year ended march  the increase in asset management fees of  for the year ended march  compared to the same prior year period reflects the increase in assets under management by ramcorp 
from million at march  to million at march  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year ended march  compared to million for fiscal year ended march  the principal component of the increase in the company s non interest expense was salaries and employee benefits 
for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  an increase over the prior year total of million 
salaries increased as the number of full time equivalent employees increased to at march  from at march   which was primarily the result of the expansion of the company s lending team and the opening of a new branch and separate lending office 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  as a result of the decrease in income before taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal year the company s overall effective tax rate at march  and takes into account the estimated oregon apportionment factors for property  payroll and sales 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted share for the year ended march   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  the increase resulted from an increase in interest income and non interest income partially offset by increases in interest expense and non interest expense 
net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a increase  from million in fiscal year this improvement reflected a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets to million and an increase in yield to 
these increases were partially offset by a increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to million and an increase in cost to 
the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million  for the fiscal year ended march  increased interest income was the result of the increase in the average balance and yield on interest earning assets 
average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal year the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the increased yield was primarily the result of the increasing interest rate environment 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million  a million or increase from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in interest expense was the result of higher rates of interest paid on deposits and borrowings that occurred during fiscal years and the weighted average interest rate of total deposits increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the mix of deposits changed as the interest rates on deposit accounts increased 
there was an increased demand for higher yielding money market accounts which was reflected in the growth of total average money market accounts in fiscal year to million compared to million in fiscal year growth in loans in fiscal year was supported by the increased average total fhlb seattle borrowings of million for the fiscal year compared to million for the fiscal year provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the same prior year period 
net recoveries for the year ended march  were  compared to net charge offs of  for the same period of last year 
annualized net recoveries to average net loans for the year ended march  was compared to annualized net charge offs of for the same period in the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses was million at march  compared to million at march  the ratio of allowance for credit losses and loan commitments to total loans at march  increased to from at march  non interest income 
non interest income increased  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period in primarily as a result of a  increase in asset management fees 
the increase in asset management fees reflects the increase in assets under management by ramcorp 
from million at march  to million at march  the  decrease in fees and service charges reflects the  decrease in credit card fees resulting from the sale of the credit card portfolio in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease in credit card fees was partially offset by increases in fees earned on deposit accounts and broker loan fees 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased  or  to million for fiscal year ended march  compared to million for fiscal year ended march  for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
salaries increased as the number of full time equivalent employees increased to at march  from at march   which was primarily the result of the expansion related to increased staffing in branches and operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the esop expiration date was extended from december  to december  this extension resulted in the third quarter reduction of esop expense of  reflecting the release of  esop shares to the esop participants at december  provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the increased tax provision was the result of the higher income in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal year the primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate was the entry into a new tax jurisdiction including the state of oregon and multnomah county in oregon

asset and liability management the company s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity increases by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans with terms to maturity of more than years 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years 
the company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve the origination of adjustable rate loans  increasing commercial  consumer loans that are adjustable rate and short term loans and residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  and the origination of fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and the retention of the related loan servicing rights 
the strategy for liabilities has been to shorten the maturities for both deposits and borrowings 
this approach has remained consistent throughout the past year  as the company has experienced a change in the mix of loans  deposits and fhlb advances 
the company s mortgage servicing activities provide additional protection from interest rate risk 
the company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans sold 
as market interest rates rise  the fixed rate loans held in portfolio diminish in value 
however  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to rise as market interest rates increase because borrowers tend not to prepay the underlying mortgages  thus providing an interest rate risk hedge versus the fixed rate loan portfolio 
the mortgage loan servicing portfolio totaled million at march  the average balance of the servicing portfolio was million and produced loan servicing income of  for the year ended march  see item business lending activities mortgage loan servicing 
consumer loans  such as home equity line of credit and installment loans  commercial loans and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
adjustable interest rate loans totaled million or of total gross loans at march  as compared to million or at march  although the company has sought to originate adjustable rate loans  the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed rate loans

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of cash flows is its operations as a lender  which generates interest income on loans 
this is supplemented by fee income  service charges  and interest on investment securities  and reduced by payment of interest expense and non interest expenses 
after payment of expenses  the company has significant positive cash flow from operating activities 
the company s investing activities typically use cash  primarily for loan originations 
for the year ended march  additional cash flows were provided by the company s financing activities as a result of a increased borrowings and the issuance of subordinated debentures 
for the year ended march  additional cash flows were provided by the company s financing activities as a result of a significant increase in deposit accounts 
the company s primary source of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the company generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at march   cash totaled million  or  of total assets 
should the bank require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb and pacific coast banker s bank borrowings 
at march  advances from fhlb totaled million and the bank had additional borrowing capacity available of million from the fhlb  subject to collateral limitations 
the bank also has a million fed funds line with pacific coast banker s bank at march  liquidity management is both a short and long term responsibility of the company s management 
the company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  iv yields available on interest bearing deposits and v its asset liability management program objectives 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb and pacific coast banker s bank 
at march   the bank s ratio of cash and eligible investments to the sum of withdrawable savings and borrowings due within one year was at march   the company had commitments to extend credit of million 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
historically  the company has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
sources of capital and liquidity for the company on a stand alone basis include distributions from the bank and the issuance of debt or equity 
dividends and other capital distributions from the bank are subject to regulatory restrictions 
ots regulations require the bank to maintain specific amounts of regulatory capital 
as of march   the bank complied with all regulatory capital requirements as of that date with tangible  core and risk based capital ratios of  and  respectively

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage  commercial and consumer loans 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are conditional  and are honored for up to days subject to the company s usual terms and conditions 
collateral is not required to support commitments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it engage in hedging activities or purchase high risk derivative instruments 
furthermore  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk

qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the company intends to reduce risk where appropriate but accepts a degree of risk when warranted by economic circumstances 
the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years 
consumer and commercial loans are originated and held in portfolio as the short term nature of these portfolio loans match durations more closely with the short term nature of retail deposits such as interest checking  money market accounts and savings accounts 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with longer terms to maturity 
except for immediate short term cash needs  and depending on the current interest rate environment  fhlb advances will have maturities of long or short term 
for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
a number of measures are utilized to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including simulation modeling as well as traditional interest rate gap analysis 
while both methods provide an indication of risk for a given change in interest rates  the simulation model is primarily used to assess the impact on earning changes in interest rates may produce 
key assumptions in the model include cash flows and maturities of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and pricing  deposit sensitivity  consumer preferences and management s capital leverage plans 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may significantly differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and specific strategies among other factors 
the following tables show the approximate percentage change in net interest income over a month period under several rate scenarios 
change in interest rates percent change in net interest income months percent change in net interest income months up basis points base case down basis points as illustrated in the above table  at march   our balance sheet continues to be slightly asset sensitive  meaning that interest earning assets reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a given period 
in the current falling interest rate environment there continues to be a negative impact on the net interest margin 
while a sustained rising interest rate environment may increase net interest income 
we attempt to limit our interest rate risk through managing the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
furthermore  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at march  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments
