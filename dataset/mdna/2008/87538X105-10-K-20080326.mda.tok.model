summary we are the world s largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft related items 
our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores 
we have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices 
the key to our success is our ability to grow our base business 
we grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations 
we intend to continue to expand both domestically  in the short term  and internationally  in the long term 
we operate in three segments 
first  wholesale leathercraft  consisting of our leather factory stores and our national account group  is the largest source of revenues million in 
this division has generally offered steady but modest increases in sales 
sales in declined 
the wholesale stores sales declined compared to and national account sales were down 
much of the sales decline at the stores is attributed to an overall weakness in consumer spending  which results in less purchases by small businesses 
the decline in national account sales is related to weaker consumer spending as well as the expected decline in sales to one customer who intends to stop purchasing from us in the first quarter of since acquiring its assets in  we have focused on re establishing tandy leather as the operator of retail leathercraft stores 
these retail stores comprise our second segment  retail leathercraft 
because of growth here  this segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales million in  up from million in 
our business plan calls for opening an average of stores annually as we work toward a goal of stores from stores at the end of we plan to open new stores in in the last half of the year 
we refer to our third segment as other 
it consists of roberts  cushman  a supplier of trimmings for headwear 
its operations are not material to us 
on a consolidated basis  a key indicator of costs  gross margin as a percent of total net sales  increased in and held steady in operating expenses as a percent of total net sales in increased from operating expenses were down as a percentage of total net sales in when compared with the increase in operating expenses in was due to our delayed response to cut expenses on weaker than expected sales  particularly in the second and third quarters 
we reported consolidated net income for of million 
consolidated net income for and was million and million  respectively 
we have used our cash flow to fund our operations  to fund the opening of new tandy leather stores  to purchase necessary property equipment and make acquisitions of small competitors in the retail and wholesale market 
in  we incurred million in bank debt to purchase a  square foot building to house our corporate headquarters and central support units 
we expect to move those departments at the end of the first quarter of at the end of  our stockholders equity had increased to million from million the previous year 
comparing the december  balance sheet with the prior year s  we increased our investments in inventory slightly million from million while total cash increased minimally to million from million 
in addition to cash on hand  we have a million bank line of credit  of which was drawn on december  the line of credit can be drawn upon only to fund capital improvements in the building we purchased 
given the amount of cash on hand  we plan to pay for the improvements with our cash rather than draw further on the line of credit 
net sales net sales for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft other total company total company incr from prior year our net sales grew by in when compared with and in when compared with these annual increases resulted primarily from our retail leathercraft expansion program  although sales did not grow as fast in compared to and due to an overall slowdown in consumer spending 
costs and expenses in general  our gross profit as a percentage of sales our gross margin fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve  the mix of products we sell  and our ability to source products globally 
our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on going process and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors 
sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels 
therefore  as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix  higher gross margins tend to follow 
finally  there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer 
as a result  our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period 
for  our cost of sales held steady as a percentage of total net sales when compared to  resulting in the same consolidated gross margin of in and our total cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales decreased for when compared to resulting in an overall increase in consolidated gross margin of from for to in increases in gross margin are primarily due to increased retail sales from year to year 
our gross margins for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft other total company our operating expenses increased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in which indicates that our operating expenses grew faster than our sales 
significant expense fluctuations in compared to are as follows expense amount incr decr over employee compensation benefits million rent utilities million depreciation advertising million legal professional fees outside services our operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in significant expense fluctuations in compared to are as follows expense amount incr decr over employee compensation benefits million million rent utilities million supplies contributions legal professional fees other income expense net other income expense consists primarily of currency exchange fluctuations and discounts taken or given 
however  in  we had other income net of  compared to other income net of  in we received rental income of  from our new building as we leased the building to the sellers for days after purchase 
we also received  as a signing bonus on an oil and gas lease we signed related to a portion of the land we purchased 
we earned  in interest income on our cash and paid  in interest expense on our bank debt 
we had a currency exchange gain of  in compared to  in in  we had other income net of  compared to a other income net of  in  attributable to currency exchange gain of  in compared to  in  and net discounts given in of  compared to net discounts taken in of net income during  we earned net income of million  a decline over our net income of million earned during the decline in net income was the result of the increase in operating expenses at a higher rate than that of our sales  partially offset by the reduction in income tax expense 
during  we earned net income of million  a improvement over our net income of million earned during as a result of the increase in our overall gross margin and an improvement in operating efficiency  our profits in grew at a rate faster than sales 
wholesale leathercraft year net sales incr decr from prior yr operating income operating income incr decr from prior year operating income as a percentage of sales wholesale leathercraft  consisting of our wholesale stores and our national account group  accounted for of our consolidated net sales in  which compares to in and in the decrease in this division s contribution to our total net sales is the result of the growth in retail leathercraft and we expect this trend to continue 
sales in the stores decreased in compared to sales in while the sales decline in our national account group was 
by customer group  we achieved gains to our wholesale and small manufacturing customers while our sales to our retail and national account customers declined 
our sales mix by customer group was as follows customer group retail institution wholesale national accounts manufacturers the increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from as decrease of in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared with  and an increase of in operating expenses as a percent of sales 
significant operating expense increases occurred in employee compensation and benefits  depreciation expense  legal and professional fees  and advertising costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in various insurance expenses  and general supplies 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from an increase of in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared with  and a decrease of in operating expenses as a percent of sales 
significant operating expense decreases occurred in contributions  various bank fees  legal and professional fees  depreciation  and advertising costs 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in employee wages  and general supplies 
retail leathercraft year net sales increase from prior yr operating income operating income incr decr from prior year operating income as a percentage of sales reflecting the growth previously discussed  retail leathercraft accounted for of our total net sales in  up from in and in growth in net sales for retail leathercraft division in and resulted primarily from our expansion program 
expansion during and consisted of the opening of and new stores  respectively 
our sales mix by customer group was as follows customer group retail institution wholesale national accounts manufacturers operating income as a percentage of sales decreased to for compared to for gross margin fell to in from in operating expenses as a percent of sales in decreased by  from for to for as operating expenses grew at a faster pace than that of sales and gross margin 
operating income as a percentage of sales increased to for compared to for gross margin remained steady at in and operating expenses as a percent of sales in decreased by  from for to for we intend to continue the expansion of tandy leather s retail store chain in by opening approximately new stores in the last half of the year 
we remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and maintains financial stability 
in the current economic environment in the us  it is possible that we will change our plans for store openings in if we determine that the us retail sector can not support additional store openings at that time 
other roberts  cushman accounted for of our total sales in compared with and in and  respectively 
operating income was  in compared to an operating loss of  in and operating income of  in roberts  cushman s sales and profits are immaterial to us as a whole 
financial condition at december   we held million of cash  million of inventory  accounts receivable of million  and million of property and equipment 
goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were  and  respectively 
we also own a leather artwork collection  most of which was created by al stohlman  a legendary leathercrafter  valued on our balance sheet at  net total assets were million 
current liabilities were million including  of current maturities of capital lease obligations  while long term debt was total stockholders equity at the end of was million 
at december   we held million of cash  million of inventory  accounts receivable of million  and million of property and equipment 
goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were  and  respectively 
net total assets were million 
current liabilities were million including  of current maturities of long term debt  while long term debt was million 
total stockholders equity at the end of was million 
specific ratios on a consolidated basis at the end of each year ended december were as follows solvency ratios quick ratio cash accts rec total current liabilities current ratio total current assets total current liabilities current liabilities to net worth total current liabilities net worth current liabilities to inventory total current liabilities inventory total liabilities to net worth total liabilities net worth fixed assets to net worth fixed assets net worth efficiency ratios collection period days outstanding accounts receivable credit sales x inventory turnover sales average inventory assets to sales total assets sales sales to net working capital sales current assets current liabilities accounts payable to sales accounts payable sales profitability ratios return on sales profit margin net profit after taxes sales return on assets net profit after taxes total assets return on net worth return on equity net profit after taxes net worth capital resources and liquidity on july   we entered into a credit agreement and line of credit note with jpmorgan chase bank  na  pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit facility of up to  to facilitate our purchase and remodel of real estate consisting of a  square foot building situated on acres of land located at se loop in fort worth  texas 
proceeds in the amount of  were used to fund the initial purchase of the property 
the remaining credit line available can be used to remodel portions of the building 
we expect to move our corporate headquarters  central warehouse and other support units into the building at the end of the first quarter of we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the jpmorgan chase credit agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements 
the principal terms and conditions of the credit agreement are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  notes payable and long term debt 
at this time  we do not intend to borrow the remaining availability on the line of credit to fund the cost of the remodel project 
as a result  the current principal balance of million will roll into a ten year term note on april  and we will begin making monthly debt service payments in may reflecting the borrowing and reduction of bank indebtedness during the periods  our financing activities for  and provided required net cash of million   and  respectively 
the primary source of liquidity and capital resources during was cash flow provided by operating activities 
cash flow from operations for and was million and million  respectively  the largest portion generated from net income partially offset by the increase in inventory in or the decreased of accrued expenses in 
cash flow from operations in was million 
consolidated accounts receivable decreased slightly to million at december  compared to million at december  average days to collect accounts slowed from days in to days in on a consolidated basis 
we have experienced a gradual slowdown in the collections of customer accounts throughout due to the overall tightening of available cash on the part of our customers 
we have tightened our credit policy and are aggressively monitoring our customer accounts to ensure collectibility 
we believe the trend in our collections is the result of the overall slowdown in the us economy 
many of our customers with open accounts are very small businesses and they tend to feel the effects of an economic slowdown more severely than larger businesses 
inventory increased from million at the end of to million at december  we expect our inventory to slowly trend upward as we continue our expansion of the tandy leather store chain 
in  we expect minimal increases in our inventory due to the expected weaknesses in our sales and the limited number of retail stores we plan to open 
we attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected store growth and expansion 
while we believe our investment in inventory at the end of was at a reasonable level given our expansion plans  it was approximately above our internal targets of optimum inventory levels 
consolidated inventory turned times during  a slight slow down from the times turned in we compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory 
by operating division  inventory turns are as follows segment wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft roberts  cushman wholesale leathercraft stores only retail leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of wholesale leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores 
the retail stores have no warehouse backstock inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse 
wholesale leathercraft s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores 
accounts payable decreased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of due primarily to the reduction in inventory purchases in the last half of the year 
as discussed above  the largest use of operating cash in was in the reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
capital expenditures totaled million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the substantial increase in capital expenditures in is due to the purchase of the land and building which will house our corporate offices and central support departments 
in  capital expenditures consisted of real estate million  factory machines and dies  fixtures and equipment for the new tandy leather retail stores  various store fixtures and computer equipment at existing stores  computer system upgrade for advertising department  computer equipment for future stores  and miscellaneous computer and other office equipment 
although we intend to continue opening or acquiring new tandy leather retail stores and therefore expenditures related to this expansion should continue into  we do expect our capital expenditures to be substantially less than that of due to the significant one time expenditures in purchase of real estate  advertising department system  etc 
however  we expect to spend million on the remodel and retrofit of the building in so our capital expenditures are not expected to return to historical levels until after we believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in  while also funding our limited expansion plans 
at this time  we know of no trends or demands  commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
in addition  we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow 
in particular  because of the relatively small investment required by each new retail store  we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during  and  and we do not currently have any such arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  not including related interest expense payments due by periods contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations our loan from jpmorgan chase matures in may these are our leased facilities 
summary of critical accounting policies we strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 
basis of consolidation 
we report our financial information on a consolidated basis 
therefore  unless there is an indication to the contrary  financial information is provided for the parent company  tandy leather factory  inc  and its subsidiaries as a whole 
transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose 
we own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated 
none of our subsidiaries are off balance sheet 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon shipment 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances  product returns  and allowances for defective merchandise 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history  and the aging of the account 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in  first out method 
this means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold 
in addition  we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
this reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand 
if actual future demand is less favorable than what we project  additional write downs may be necessary 
goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier 
goodwill 
we periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carry value 
as of december   we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the stores associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances 
if actual results of these stores differ significantly from our projections  such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the sec  or in other written or oral statements made or to be made by us  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
words such as may  assume  forecast  position  predict  strategy  expect  intend  plan  estimate  anticipate  believe  project  budget  potential  or continue  and similar expressions are used to identify forward looking statements 
they can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties 
consequently  no forward looking statements can be guaranteed 
actual results may vary materially 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
you should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
we do not intend to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movement in foreign current exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in canada 
the leather factory of canada  ltd 
has local currency canadian dollar revenue and local currency operating expenses 
beginning in  we will also have foreign currency exposure related to our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
tandy leather factory uk limited has local currency british pounds revenue and local currency operating expenses 
changes in the currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information  for financial information concerning our foreign activities 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on certain outstanding debt 
however  our current credit agreement with jpmorgan chase includes a fixed interest rate 
therefore  changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area
