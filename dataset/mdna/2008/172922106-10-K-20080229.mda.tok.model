earnings overview vs 
net income was  in  down from  in net income per share basic and diluted was basic and diluted in and in return on average equity was in and in return on average assets was in and in cash dividends declared were per share in both and annual earnings for were impacted by a substantial decline in realized gains from available for sale securities  as net pre tax gains totaled  in as compared to  in the lower net securities gains in reflect two significant factors management s decision in the second quarter to restructure the securities portfolio by selling mortgage backed securities for a realized loss of  with the proceeds reinvested at higher yields  and lower levels of realized gains from sales of bank stocks in  due to lower market valuations of financial stocks 
excluding gains and losses on sales of available for sale securities  net of tax  and excluding the impact of reinvestment of proceeds from sales  net income per share was basic and diluted in  as compared to basic and diluted in on may   the acquisition of citizens bancorp  inc became effective 
citizens bancorp  inc was the parent company of citizens trust company  with offices in coudersport  port allegany and emporium  pa 
the citizens trust company operations  which are now part of c n bank  contributed significantly to growth in total assets  including loans  as well as growth in deposits and trust assets under management  and increases in revenues and expenses in note to the consolidated financial statements includes pro forma income statement information  presented as if citizens bancorp  inc had been included in the corporation s operating results since january  as presented in note  after adjustment to exclude nonrecurring merger expenses and securities losses incurred by citizens bancorp  inc in early prior to the acquisition  the corporation s pro forma net income per share would have been basic and diluted in  and basic and diluted in by the end of  duplicate personnel and other operating costs had been eliminated  and the core banking and trust computer systems were converted to the corporation s systems 
accordingly  management expects the addition of the former citizens bancorp  inc operations to be accretive to earnings in in addition to the effects of lower net securities gains described above  other significant income statement changes between and were as follows the net interest margin increased  or  in as compared to most of the increase in the net interest margin between years occurred in the last six months of factors contributing to recent improvements in the net interest margin include the acquisition of citizens trust company  which resulted in increased interest and fees on loans  and provided funding to help pay off borrowings  a change in the shape of the yield curve  which has become positive after remaining flat or inverted throughout and the first half of  allowing the corporation opportunities to earn a positive spread from borrowing and investing activities  and the increase in yield on the investment portfolio resulting from the restructuring described above 
noninterest income  excluding realized gains on available for sale securities  increased  in over trust and financial management revenue increased  
assets under management by c n s trust and financial management group increased  to  at december  from  at december  the increase in trust assets under management resulted from the acquisition of citizens bancorp  inc  market value appreciation and new business 
there were also significant increases in other sources of noninterest revenue  including service charges on deposits and other revenues 
noninterest income is discussed in more detail later in management s discussion and analysis 
noninterest expense increased  in as compared to the increase in expenses reflects the addition of citizens trust company 
also  professional fees of  were incurred in related to the computer core system conversions of the first state bank new york and citizens trust company operations 
other changes affecting noninterest expense are discussed later in management s discussion and analysis 
in  the income tax provision was  or of pre tax income 
in  the income tax provision was  or of pre tax income 
the higher income tax rate incurred in reflects management s decision to reduce the amount of average investments in municipal bonds  in an effort to eliminate alternative minimum tax 
vs 
net income in was  or per share basic and diluted 
net income for was down from per share basic and per share diluted in earnings results for were negatively impacted by the yield curve  which moved from flat to inverted  and by increases in noninterest expense 
the net interest margin decreased  or  in as compared to the flat or inverted yield curve  along with competitive pressures  caused interest rates paid on liabilities mainly deposits and borrowings to increase more than the rates of interest earned on loans and investment securities 
further  the flat or inverted yield curve resulted in limited opportunities to earn a positive spread from maintaining borrowed funds and holding investment securities 
accordingly  the corporation sold securities and repaid borrowings throughout much of the balance of available for sale securities was  lower at december  than one year earlier  and the december  balance of short term and long term borrowings was  lower than one year earlier 
noninterest expense increased  in over much of the increase in noninterest expense in was attributable to operations and start up costs in new markets  including the first state bank offices canisteo and south hornell in new york state  and the jersey shore and old lycoming township offices in pennsylvania 
gains related to sales of credit card loans totaled  in and  in in the fourth quarter  the corporation sold the c n bank credit card receivables  and recorded a gain of  after the sale  the corporation continued to provide servicing of credit cards for a portion of  and was subject to possible losses associated with credit card receivables sold with recourse 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation recorded an additional gain of  for the difference between the initial estimates of post sale servicing expenses and recourse losses  and the actual amounts incurred 
also in  the corporation sold first state bank s credit card portfolio for a gain of  net realized gains from sales of securities amounted to  in  an increase of  over most of the gains realized in were from sales of bank stocks 
also  in the fourth quarter  c n had net losses from sales of securities of  the fourth quarter losses were mainly from sales of debt securities that were purchased in and  when market yields were lower than in the provision for loan losses was  in  down from  in in  negotiations and workout of a few large  commercial loans were completed  resulting in charge offs that were significantly less than the estimated allowances that had been previously established 
outlook for management is cautiously optimistic about the corporation s earnings prospects in one positive development is that the yield curve began to change to a more positive shape meaning that long term rates began to be higher than short term rates in the latter portion of  after being flat or inverted for approximately three years 
as described in more detail in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  the corporation is liability sensitive  meaning that its sources of funds mainly deposits and borrowings tend to re price more quickly on average when interest rates change than do its earning assets mainly loans and available for sale debt securities 
accordingly  the corporation tends to generate lower earnings when short term interest rates rise and higher earnings when short term rates fall 
with recent reductions in the fed funds target rate which dropped from in august to its level in late february of  the corporation has experienced some recent reductions in its cost of funds 
in december  management entered into a significant leveraged investment purchase transaction  for two purposes to generate incremental positive net interest income  and to reduce the magnitude of the corporation s reduction in net interest income if interest rates rise significantly within the next few years 
specifically  the corporation purchased mortgage backed securities and a collateralized mortgage obligation for a total cost of approximately million  funded mainly by two repurchase agreements borrowings of  each 
the weighted average initial book yield on the securities was 
the borrowings have a weighted average interest rate of  and mature in one of the borrowings is putable by the issuer at quarterly intervals starting in december  and the other is putable quarterly starting in december each of these borrowings contains an embedded cap  providing that on the quarterly anniversary of the transaction settlement date  if three month libor is higher than  the corporation s interest rate payable will decrease by twice the amount of the excess  down to a minimum rate of 
the embedded caps expire on the initial put dates in and for the year and year time periods indicated  if interest rates were to rise significantly  the embedded cap feature could cause the corporation s interest expense on the borrowings to decrease  which would be a mitigant to the corporation s overall interest rate risk position 
as discussed in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis  the addition of citizens bancorp  inc is expected to be accretive to earnings in  and inclusion of those operations for the full year in as opposed to eight months in will lead to higher reported levels of revenues and expenses 
the addition of the citizens trust company trust department has contributed significantly to growth in trust assets under management and revenue  and management expects continued strong trust revenue performance in in january  the corporation implemented an overdraft privilege program 
this program is designed to provide customers an opportunity to have checks paid that would otherwise have been returned  and to avoid charges from merchants and other payees 
in turn  management expects the corporation to generate higher levels of noninterest revenue from implementing the overdraft privilege program in as discussed in note to the financial statements  in october the corporation s board of directors adopted amendments to the defined benefit pension plan to freeze and terminate the plan  effective december  the purpose of freezing and terminating the plan is to control and reduce future employee benefit expenses 
the board of directors also approved an amendment to the corporation s employee savings retirement plan a k plan  which would increase matching contributions under that plan in based on the current number and composition of employees and k plan participation  the increase in expense in associated with the k plan will be approximately  which is less than the ongoing expense  for the year ended december   excluding a loss from curtailment of  that would be expected from maintaining the defined benefit pension plan 
the corporation will record a realized loss from settlement of the defined benefit pension plan at the time it funds the final amounts necessary to extinguish its obligations under the plan 
the amount of settlement loss  which management expects will be incurred in  has not yet been finally determined  however  management estimates a settlement loss in the income statement from termination of the plan in in an amount ranging from  to another major variable that affects the corporation s earnings is securities gains and losses 
management s decisions regarding sales of securities are based on a variety of factors  with the overall goal of maximizing portfolio return over a long term horizon 
most of the corporation s realized gains on available for sale securities in recent years have been from sales of bank stocks 
recently  market valuations of financial stocks have generally been depressed  and management believes that reports of sub prime mortgage losses and similar events  mainly by very large financial institutions  have cast a shadow over stock prices for the entire sector 
while management believes this valuation issue to be cyclical  opportunities for realized gains from bank stocks may be limited in further  as discussed in more detail in note to the financial statements  the corporation has significant unrealized losses on its holdings of municipal bonds and trust preferred securities as of december  in the fourth quarter  management has discussed the corporation s individual holdings of municipal bonds and trust preferred securities with its investment advisors  and has concluded that no downgrades or deterioration in the credit quality of the securities has occurred that would warrant an other than temporarily impairment charge to the income statement 
management will continue to closely monitor the status of the municipal bonds  trust preferred issues and other debt securities in total capital purchases for are estimated at million million  with computer hardware and software the largest planned categories of expenditure 
management has no current plans to build or acquire new branches in  but will evaluate opportunities that arise if they seem likely to contribute positively to future earnings and shareholder value 
critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
the corporation s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing these fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
accordingly  when selling debt securities  management typically obtains price quotes from more than one source 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the large majority of the corporation s securities are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported separately through accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity 
net interest margin the corporation s primary source of operating income is represented by the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest margin in  and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
accordingly  the net interest margin amounts presented in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables 
the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was  in   higher than in as shown in table iii  net increases in volume had the effect of increasing net interest income  in over  and interest rate changes had the effect of increasing net interest income  increases in volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were significantly affected by the acquisition of citizens trust company on may  the most significant components of the volume changes in were an increase of  attributable to loan growth and a decrease in interest expense on short term and long term borrowings of  partially offset by lower interest income of  from available for sale securities and an increase in interest expense of  on certificates of deposit 
although interest rates began to fall in the latter portion of  rates were higher on average in than in table iii shows that changes in rates had the effect of increasing interest income  and increasing interest expense  in over as presented in table ii  the interest rate spread excess of average rate of return on interest bearing assets over average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities was in  comparable to the interest rate spread in on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income fell  to  in from  in as reflected in table iii  interest rate changes had the effect of decreasing net interest income  in as compared to  as rising short term interest rates caused increases in interest expense 
table iii also shows that volume changes had the effect of increasing net interest income  in over the major components of the increase in net interest income from volume changes in were an increase of  attributable to loan growth and a decrease in interest expense of  related to lower long term borrowings  partially offset by  lower interest income from a lower volume of available for sale securities 
as presented in table ii  the interest rate spread excess of average rate of return on interest bearing assets over average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities shrunk to in from in interest income and earning assets interest income totaled  in  an increase of over interest and fees from loans increased  or  while income from available for sale securities decreased  or 
as indicated in table ii  the average balance of gross loans increased to  in from  in excluding the impact of the acquisition of citizens trust company  average loans increased 
the average rate of return on loans was in  up from in total average available for sale securities in fell to  a decrease of  or from throughout the calendar year and the first nine months of  proceeds from sales and maturities of securities were used  in part  to help fund loans and pay off borrowings 
within the available for sale securities portfolio  the average balance of tax exempt municipal bonds shrunk by  in as compared to management decided in mid to reduce the corporation s investment in municipal bonds in order to reduce the alternative minimum tax liability 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities was for  up from in interest income totaled  in  or higher than in interest and fees from loans increased  or  while income from available for sale securities decreased  or 
the majority of the increase in interest income resulted from higher loan volume  along with an increase in the average rate earned on loans  which more than offset the effect of the lower average volume of available for sale securities 
total average gross loans increased in over  to  from  the average rate of return on loans was in  up from in interest expense and interest bearing liabilities interest expense rose  or  to  in from  in table ii shows that the overall cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities rose to in  from in from table iii  you can calculate that total average deposits interest bearing and noninterest bearing increased  to  in from  in in july  the citizens trust company trust operations were converted to the same operational platform as citizens northern bank  and  of money market deposits was transferred to another financial institution 
management utilizes a third party provider for trust financial management money market allocations primarily for interest rate risk management reasons

also  the average rate on individual retirement accounts increased significantly  to in from in the combined average total short term and long term borrowed funds decreased  to  in from  in the yield curve was flat or inverted throughout and the first half of  creating limited opportunities for earning a positive spread by purchasing or holding investment securities as compared to interest costs associated with maintaining borrowed funds 
accordingly  throughout that period of time  the corporation paid off many borrowings as they matured

average money market account balances decreased  or  in as compared to  as some depositors moved balances to higher rate certificates of deposit or withdrew funds to invest in equities 
most of the increase in interest checking balances in was attributable to one local governmental customer  for which the corporation became the primary depository institution in september in addition  the acquisition of first state bank contributed significantly to the increase in average deposits in compared to excluding first state bank  average total deposits increased in compared to the combined average total short term and long term borrowed funds decreased  to  in from  in as discussed earlier in management s discussion and analysis  because the yield curve was flat or inverted  the corporation paid off most borrowings as they matured in table i analysis of interest income and expense years ended december  increase decrease in thousands interest income available for sale securities taxable tax exempt total available for sale securities held to maturity securities  taxable trading securities interest bearing due from banks federal funds sold loans taxable tax exempt total loans total interest income interest expense interest checking money market savings certificates of deposit individual retirement accounts other time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings total interest expense net interest income interest income from tax exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis  using the corporation s marginal federal income tax rate of

financial condition significant changes in the average balances of the corporation s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are described in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis 
that discussion provides useful information regarding changes in the corporation s balance sheet over the year period ended december   including discussions of available for sale securities  loans  deposits and borrowings 
the acquisition of citizens bancorp  inc on may  was funded approximately with cash and with stock  increasing the corporation s assets  liabilities  and stockholders equity  at the date of acquisition 
other significant balance sheet items the allowance for loan losses and stockholders equity are discussed in separate sections of management s discussion and analysis 
table vi shows the composition of the investment portfolio at december   and comparison of the amortized cost totals of available for sale securities at each year end presented reflects a reduction from  at december  to  at december   then an increase to  at december  the increase in the investment portfolio in resulted mainly from a leveraged investment purchase of securities in december  as discussed in more detail in the outlook for section of management s discussion and analysis 
prior to the yield curve changing to a more positive shape in the latter part of  management had been shrinking the balance sheet  meaning that proceeds from principal payments on the investment portfolio were not being reinvested  instead  proceeds were used mainly to pay off borrowings or to fund loans 
at december   the amortized cost of the available for sale securities portfolio exceeded the estimated fair value by  as discussed in more detail in note to the financial statements  the corporation has significant unrealized losses on its holdings of municipal bonds and trust preferred securities as of december  in the fourth quarter  management has discussed the corporation s individual holdings of municipal bonds and trust preferred securities with its investment advisors  and has concluded that no downgrades or deterioration in the credit quality of the securities has occurred that would warrant an other that temporarily impairment charge to the income statement 
management will continue to closely monitor the status of the municipal bonds  trust preferred issues and other debt securities in the balance of loans outstanding without consideration of the allowance for loan losses has grown  from the balance at december  to the total outstanding of  at december  of the total increase   came from balances acquired from citizens bancorp  inc and first state bank 
excluding the effects of acquisitions  total loans fell slightly in  and grew in  in and in loan volumes are heavily dependent on economic conditions in the corporation s market area  and are significantly influenced by interest rates 
overall  the corporation has experienced growth in commercial and consumer mortgage lending over the past years 
the corporation has not originated interest only mortgages  loans without documentation of the borrowers sources of income or net worth  or other types of exotic mortgage loans that have made headlines in recent months  and which have led some lenders and investors to realize significant losses from these types of instruments 
table viii presents a table of loan maturities  based on data as of november  the last date in for which the corporation ran the interest rate simulation model used to generate the loan maturities information included in table viii 
fixed rate loans are included in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  while variable rate loans are included based on contractual principal repayments  with the remaining balance reflected in the table as of the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that approximately of the loan portfolio is fixed rate 
of the of the portfolio made up of variable rate loans  a significant portion will re price after more than one year 
variable rate loans re pricing after more than one year include significant amounts of residential and commercial loans 
the corporation s substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans and variable rate loans with extended until re pricing is one of the major concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices 
see part ii  item a for a more detailed discussion of the corporation s interest rate risk

the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
in evaluating collectibility  management considers a number of factors  including the status of specific impaired loans  trends in historical loss experience  delinquency trends  credit concentrations  and economic conditions within the corporation s market area 
allowances for impaired loans are determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense  and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
there are two major components of the allowance statement of financial accounting standards sfas allowances on larger loans  mainly commercial purpose  determined on a loan by loan basis  and sfas allowances estimates of losses incurred on the remainder of the portfolio  determined based on collective evaluation of impairment for various categories of loans 
sfas allowances include a portion based on historical net charge off experience  and a portion based on evaluation of qualitative factors 
each quarter  management performs a detailed assessment of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
a management committee called the watch list committee performs this assessment 
quarterly  the watch list committee and the applicable lenders discuss each loan relationship under review  and reach a consensus on the appropriate sfas estimated loss amount for the quarter 
the watch list committee s focus is on ensuring that all pertinent facts have been considered  and that the sfas loss amounts are reasonable 
the assessment process includes review of certain loans reported on the watch list 
all loans  which lenders or the credit administration staff has assigned a risk rating of special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss  are included in the watch list 
the scope of loans evaluated individually for impairment sfas evaluation include all loan relationships greater than  for c n bank loans  and  for first state bank  for which there is at least one extension of credit graded special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
also  loan relationships less than  in the aggregate  but with an estimated loss of  or more  are individually evaluated for impairment 
currently  the banks risk management and credit administration personnel perform annual  independent credit reviews of large credit relationships 
in prior years  outside consulting firms were retained to perform such functions 
management gives substantial consideration to the classifications and recommendations of the credit reviewers in determining the allowance for loan losses 
the sfas component of the allowance includes estimates of losses incurred on loans that have not been individually evaluated for impairment 
management uses loan categories included in the call report a quarterly report filed by fdic insured banks to identify categories of loans with similar risk characteristics  and multiplies the loan balances for each category as of each quarter end by two different factors to determine the sfas allowance amounts 
these two factors are based on historical net charge off experience  and qualitative factors 
the sum of the allowance amounts calculated for each risk category  including both the amount based on historical net charge off experience and the amount based on evaluation of qualitative factors  is equal to the total sfas component of the allowance 
the historical net charge off portion of the sfas allowance component is calculated by the accounting department as of the end of the applicable quarter 
for each loan classification category used in the call report  the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the ratio of net charge offs to average quarterly loan balances for the previous three calendar years 
prior to the fourth quarter  c n bank had utilized the ratio of net charge offs to average balances over a five year period in calculating the historical loan loss experience portion of the allowance portfolio 
management made the change to the three year assumption  which had very little effect on the allowance valuation as of december   mainly because management believes net charge off experience over a year period may be more representative of losses existing in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
effective in the second quarter  management began to calculate the effects of specific qualitative factors criteria to determine a percentage increase or decrease in the sfas allowance  in relation to the historical net charge off percentage 
the qualitative factors analysis involves assessment of changes in factors affecting the portfolio  to provide for estimated differences between losses currently inherent in the portfolio and the amounts determined based on recent historical loss rates and from identification of losses on specific individual loans 
a management committee called the qualitative factors committee meets quarterly  near the end of the final month of each quarter 
the qualitative factors committee discusses several qualitative factors  including economic conditions  lending policies  changes in the portfolio  risk profile of the portfolio  competition and regulatory requirements  and other factors  with consideration given to how the factors affect three distinct parts of the loan portfolio commercial  mortgage and consumer 
during or soon after completion of the meeting  each member of the committee prepares an update to his or her recommended percentage adjustment for each qualitative factor  and average qualitative factor adjustments are calculated for commercial  mortgage and consumer loans 
the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the applicable qualitative factor percentages  to determine the portion of the sfas allowance attributable to qualitative factors 
average qualitative factors used in calculating the sfas portion of the allowance did not change significantly by more than a few basis points for any category over the course of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses table table x includes the sfas component of the allowance on the line item called impaired loans 
sfas estimated losses  including both the portion determined based on historical net charge off results  as well as the portion based on management s assessment of qualitative factors  are allocated in table x to the applicable categories of commercial  consumer mortgage and consumer loans 
table x reflects a significant increase in the allowance on consumer mortgages to  at december  from  at december   mainly because of growth in outstanding mortgage loans 
in periods prior to  the portion of the allowance determined by management s subjective assessment of economic conditions and other factors which is now calculated using the qualitative factors criteria described above was reflected completely in the unallocated component of the allowance 
primarily as a result of this change in process  table x shows a reduction in the unallocated portion of the allowance to at december    at december  and at december  from  at december  the allowance for loan losses was  at december   up from the balances of  at december  and  at december  as shown in table ix  the allowance for loan losses recorded as a result of the citizens trust company acquisition was  and was based on citizens trust company s sfas allowance at the time of acquisition 
as shown in table ix  net charge offs in of  were substantially lower by comparison than the recent historical levels of  in and  in table ix also shows the provision for loan losses totaled  in  down from  in and  in in  settlements were reached related to two large commercial loan relationships that had previously been classified as impaired 
total charge offs related to these two relationships were  or approximately  less than the estimated valuation allowance amounts that had been previously recorded 
lower than anticipated charge off levels have contributed to a reduction in the provision for loan losses in the last two years 
the total amount of the provision for loan losses for each year is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of all of the factors described above 
table xi presents information related to past due and impaired loans 
as of december   total impaired loans amounted to  down substantially from  at december    at december  and  at december  nonaccrual loans totaled  at december  down from  at december   but increased from  at december  over the period  there have been a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts 
the primary reduction in impaired and nonaccrual loans during resulted from the removal of loans for two unrelated commercial relationships from impaired and nonaccrual status during the second and third quarters 
in  management identified three unrelated commercial loan relationships with outstanding balances totaling approximately  that were moved to nonaccrual status and classified as impaired  and offset the settlements of two other large commercial loan relationships 
as of december   the sfas valuation allowance on impaired loans includes  related to three unrelated commercial relationships 
management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss  and nonaccrual status  however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of december  management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for possible credit losses  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate

liquidity liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost 
an adequate liquidity position permits the corporation to pay creditors  compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand 
the corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day to day liquidity 
also  the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with fhlb pittsburgh  secured by various securities and mortgage loans 
at december   the corporation had unused borrowing availability with correspondent banks and fhlb pittsburgh totaling approximately  additionally  the corporation uses repurchase agreements placed with brokers to borrow funds secured by investment assets  and uses reposweep arrangements to borrow funds from commercial banking customers on an overnight basis 
if required to raise cash in an emergency situation  the corporation could sell non pledged investment securities to meet its obligations 
at december   the carrying value of non pledged securities was  management believes the combination of its strong capital position discussed in the next section and ample available borrowing facilities have placed the corporation in a position of minimal short term and long term liquidity risk 
stockholders equity and capital adequacy the corporation and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
for many years  the corporation and c n bank have maintained extremely strong capital positions  and first state bank is also well capitalized 
details concerning the corporation s and the banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as reflected in note  at december  and  the ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average total assets are well in excess of regulatory capital requirements 
the corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available for sale securities 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  amounted to  at december  and  at december  changes in accumulated other comprehensive income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity 
effective december   the corporation applied sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires the corporation to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as a liability or asset in the balance sheet 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to sfas no 
was  at december  and  at december  comprehensive income comprehensive income is a measure of the change in equity of a corporation  excluding transactions with owners in their capacity as owners such as proceeds from issuances of stock and dividends 
the difference between net income and comprehensive income is termed other comprehensive income 
comprehensive income should not be construed to be a measure of net income 
for the corporation  other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive income may vary widely from period to period  depending on the financial markets as a whole and how the portfolio of available for sale securities is affected by interest rate movements 
beginning in  the change in accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the impact of sfas no 
on defined benefit plans is also included in other comprehensive income 
total comprehensive income was  in   in and  in other comprehensive loss amounted to  in   in and  in inflation the corporation is significantly affected by the federal reserve board s efforts to control inflation through changes in short term interest rates 
over the period through  the federal reserve increased the fed funds target rate times  from a low of to 
the fed funds target rate stayed at until august during that time period  long term interest rates did not increase as much as short term rates  which hurt the corporation s profitability by squeezing the net interest margin 
from august through late february  in response to concerns about weakness in the us economy  the federal reserve has lowered the fed funds target rate several times  to its current level of  and long term rates are now higher than short term rates 
there are many signs of inflationary pressures looming over the us economy as of late february  including a decline in value of the us dollar against many of the world s currencies over the last year or so 
while the federal reserve has recently lowered the fed funds target rate  which has lowered short term rates and therefore the corporation s cost of funds  inflationary pressures may force the fed to change course and begin raising rates in the future 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no  to establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures on fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective beginning in and will affect the corporation s disclosures of information regarding fair values of financial instruments  but are currently not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  the corporation s fiscal year 
the corporation does not currently anticipate making an election to measure any financial instruments at fair value other than instruments that are already measured at fair value  and therefore does not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no

currently  the provisions of sfas no 
would not apply to the corporation  because the corporation owns and controls of the entities within its consolidated group 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the corporation s two major categories of market risk are interest rate risk and equity securities risk  which are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
the corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
the information in the table below was based on only the assets and liabilities of c n bank 
c n bank makes up more than of the corporation s total assets and liabilities  and is the source of the most volatile interest rate risk 
in  management began to run the model on a consolidated basis  as well as for each of the individual banks 
the consolidated information included in the table below was prepared based on data as of november   with pro forma adjustment to include the significant leveraged investment purchase transaction discussed below that occurred in december in  the corporation s asset liability committee changed its schedule for regular meetings to a quarterly schedule of meetings held shortly after month ends of february  may  august and november 
accordingly  management ran the simulation model for the last time in using november data 
for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
the corporation s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the policy provides limits at  and basis points from current rates for fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario 
the policy also limits acceptable market value variances from the baseline values based on current rates 
as indicated in the table  the corporation is liability sensitive  and therefore net interest income and market value increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise 
the table shows that as of november   the changes in net interest income and market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios  while at december   the decline in net interest income and market value exceeded the policy threshold marks if interest rates were to immediately rise or basis points 
as discussed in the outlook for section of management s discussion and analysis  in december  the corporation entered into repurchase agreements borrowings totaling million to fund the purchase of investment securities 
in addition to generating positive earnings from the spread of the return on the investment securities over the current cost of the borrowings  the transaction reduces the magnitude of the corporation s overall liability sensitive position 
specifically  the borrowings include embedded caps providing that  if month libor were to exceed  the interest rate payable on the repurchase agreements would fall  down to a minimum of  based on parameters included in the repurchase agreements 
the embedded caps feature was a major reason the corporation moved from being out of policy which had been the case throughout the first three quarters of  as well as at december  to its current position of operating within policy limits 
the table that follows was prepared using the simulation model described above 
the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest margin and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates

the corporation also owns some other stocks and mutual funds 
investments in bank stocks are subject to the risk factors affecting the banking industry generally  including competition from non bank entities  credit risk  interest rate risk and other factors that could result in a decline in market prices 
also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
further  because of the concentration of its holdings in pennsylvania banks  these investments could decline in value if there were a downturn in the state s economy 
the corporation s management monitors its risk associated with its equity securities holdings by reviewing its holdings on a detailed  individual security basis  at least monthly  considering all of the factors described above
