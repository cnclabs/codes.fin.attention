you should read the following discussion and analysis along with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes attached to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp tfs and zfns  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms 
we have continued to place more emphasis on higher value therapeutic product development and related strategic partnerships and less emphasis on our enabling technology collaborations 
we believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value  therapeutic product development activities 
at the same time  it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and subject us to higher financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development 
we filed an investigational new drug ind application with the us food and drug administration fda and have initiated three phase clinical trial of a zfp therapeutic in patients with diabetic neuropathy 
development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products are gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  pre clinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies  stock based compensation expenses  allocated facilities costs  subcontracted research expenses  and expenses for technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase significantly as we focus increasingly on development of zfp therapeutics 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs and zfns as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 

table of contents general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  patent prosecution expenses  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
sangamo believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revenue from research activities made under strategic partnering agreements and enabling technology collaborations is recognized as the services are provided when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received in advance under such agreements are deferred until the above criteria are met and the research services are performed 
sangamo s research grants are typically multi year agreements and provide for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development as defined under the terms of the grant agreement 
revenue under grant agreements is recognized when the related qualified research expenses are incurred 
grant reimbursements are typically received on a quarterly basis and are subject to the issuing agency s right of audit 
milestone payments under research  partnering  or licensing agreements are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criterion is considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
stock based compensation prior to january   the company accounted for our stock based employee compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

as a result  no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant prior to january  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
subsequent to the effective date  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
are no longer an alternative to financial 
table of contents statement recognition 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
amortized on an accelerated basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  in operating expenses 
as of december   total compensation cost related to nonvested stock options to be recognized in future periods was million  which is expected to be expensed over a weighted average period of months

even with this change in resource allocation  we anticipate increasing revenues over the next several years primarily related to our research license and commercial option agreement with dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of dow chemical corporation and our laboratory research reagents license agreement with sigma aldrich corporation 
total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and research grants 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in from was principally attributable to revenues of approximately million in connection with our laboratory research reagents license agreement with sigma  revenues of  in connection with our research and license agreement with genentech  inc and increased revenues of  in connection with our research license and commercial option agreement with das 
this was partially offset by decreased revenues from pfizer inc of  and johnson johnson of  the increase in from was principally attributable to increased revenues of approximately million in connection with our research license and commercial option agreement with das and  in connection with our collaboration in the field of regenerative medicine with lifescan 
research grant revenues were million in  million in and  in the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased revenues of million related to our grant with the juvenile diabetes research foundation and  related to our grant with the michael j 
fox foundation 
this was partially offset by decreases in revenues of  in connection with our advanced technology program grant awarded by the national institute of standards and technology   in connection with our cystic fibrosis grant awarded by the cystic fibrosis foundation and  in connection with our zfn driven gene disruption of ccr as a potential treatment of aids grant awarded by the national institutes of health

we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase of million in from was principally due to increased expenses related to our diabetic neuropathy clinical studies of million  salaries and benefits of million  pre clinical studies of million  drug production costs associated with our ongoing and planned clinical studies of million  laboratory supplies of  facilities of  and stock based compensation of  this was partially offset by decreased licensing expenses of million  primarily associated with the acquisition of all assets in edwards zfp therapeutic angiogenesis program valued at million

drug development is inherently uncertain and the successful completion of our development programs is subject to numerous technological challenges and risks and we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our programs 
material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risk factors our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  professional fees  allocated facilities costs  expenses for patent prosecution and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads  we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business
