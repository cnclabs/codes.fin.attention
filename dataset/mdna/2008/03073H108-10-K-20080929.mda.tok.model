item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements 
the results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
certain statements in this discussion and analysis  including statements regarding our strategy  financial performance  and revenue sources  are forward looking statements based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements  including those described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies change in financial statement presentation for the year ended june   the company has revised its financial statements to be presented in accordance with article of regulation s x as an investment company 
due to the revised format  the company made certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported in its prior year annual statements in order to conform to the current year presentation 
although the reclassifications resulted in changes to certain line items in the previously filed financial statements  the overall effect of the reclassifications noted below did not impact total stockholder s equity or net assets available 
below are the primary items affected by the reclassifications made unrealized gains losses previously reported as part of other comprehensive income loss  net were reclassified to net unrealized gains losses on investments in the statement of operations 
the effect of such reclassifications also changed previously reported amounts available to common shareholders 
gains and losses on sales of investments previously reported as part of total investment income  net in the statement of operations were reclassified to net realized gains losses on investments 
write off and depreciation on interest and loans receivable  net previously reported as part of total operating expenses in the statement of operations were reclassified to net unrealized gains losses on investments and net realized gains losses on investments 
the change in format also resulted in the statement of stockholders equity essentially being replaced with the statement of changes in net assets available  which is now presented 
in addition  the schedule of investments has been expanded and certain other disclosures were added  such as the financial highlights 
we believe the changes noted above conform to the filing format for bdcs  such as the company  and will provide a more meaningful representation of the company s operations going forward 
investment valuations the company s loans receivable  net of participations and any unearned discount are considered investment securities under the act and are recorded at fair value 
as part of fair value methodology  loans are valued at cost adjusted for any unrealized appreciation depreciation 
since no ready market exists for these loans  the fair value is determined in good faith by management  and approved by the board of directors 
in determining the fair value  the company and board of directors consider factors such as the financial condition of borrower  the adequacy of the collateral  individual credit risks  historical loss experience  and the relationships between current and projected market rates and portfolio rates of interest and maturities 
foreclosed properties  which represent collateral received from defaulted borrowers  are valued similarly 
loans are considered non performing once they become days past due as to principal or interest 
the value of past due loans are periodically determined in good faith by management  and if  in the judgment of management  the amount is not collectible and the fair value of the collateral is less than the amount due  the value of the loan will be reduced to fair value 
equity investments common stock and stock warrants  including certain controlled subsidiary portfolio investments and investment securities are recorded at fair value  represented as cost  plus or minus unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such quoted amounts 
if no public market exists  the fair value of investments that have no ready market are determined in good faith by management  and approved by the board of directors  based upon assets and revenues of the underlying investee companies as well as general market trends for businesses in the same industry 
the company records the investment in life insurance policies at fair value  represented as cost  plus or minus unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
the fair value of the investment in life settlement contracts have no ready market and are determined in good faith by management  and approved by the board of directors  based on actuarial life expectancy  including health evaluations 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations  the company s estimates of the values of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed  and the differences could be material 
assets acquired in satisfaction of loans assets acquired in satisfaction of loans are carried at the lower of the net value of the related foreclosed loan or the estimated fair value less cost of disposal 
losses incurred at the time of foreclosure are charged to the unrealized depreciation on loans receivable 
subsequent reductions in estimated net realizable value are charged to operations as losses on assets acquired in satisfaction of loans 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the fair value of the company s investments 
income recognition interest income  including interest on loans in default  is recorded on an accrual basis and in accordance with loan terms to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected 
the company recognizes interest income on loans classified as non performing only to the extent that the fair market value of the related collateral exceeds the specific loan balance 
loans that are not fully collateralized and in the process of collection are placed on nonaccrual status when  in the judgment of management  the collectability of interest and principal is doubtful 
contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings in the course of its daily operations from enforcement of its rights in disputes pursuant to the terms of various contractual arrangements 
in this connection  the company assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters as well as a potential range of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserve required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income for the year ended july   increased  or to  as compared with the prior year ended june  the increase is primarily due to increases in interest income of  which was offset by a decrease of other fees of  and a decrease in leasing income of  elk conducted no leasing activities in the year ended june  the increase in interest income is primarily due to a re allocation of assets in the company s investment portfolio as compared to the year ended june  medallion loans outstanding decreased by  or  to  as compared with the prior year ended june  the interest rate earned on medallion loans decreased in as compared with the prior year  leading to a decrease in income of  commercial loans outstanding decreased by  or  to  as compared with the prior year ended june  offsetting this decrease in commercial loans outstanding was stronger performance in the remaining portfolio  interest rate floors and collection of past due interest 
corporate loans outstanding increased by  or  to  as compared with the prior year ended june  the interest rate earned on corporate loans decreased in  as compared with the prior year  primarily due to decreases in libor 
this was offset by higher rates earned on loans originated in this fiscal year and further offset by increases in rates on existing loans due to covenant resets 
life settlements contracts outstanding increased by  or  as compared with the prior year ended june  the interest rate on these contracts was constant over the two periods  resulting in an increase in interest income as compared with the prior year ended june  operating expenses interest expense for the year ended june  increased  or to  when compared to the year ended june  interest expense increased due to a net increase in average bank borrowings over the course of the year ended june  at june   overall bank borrowings had a net decrease of  as compared to the prior year ended june  offsetting the increase in average bank borrowings was a decrease in the average interest rate the company paid on its lines of credit 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the costs associated with the hiring of a new employee during the year ended june   as well as increases due under various employment agreements 
occupancy costs increased  or  when compared with the year ended june  due to increased office space utilized for an executive hired in the year ended june   as well as increased general overhead expenses 
professional fees decreased  or when compared with the prior year 
this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in accounting fees  which was partially offset by increases in internal control consulting fees 
miscellaneous administrative expenses decreased  or when compared with the prior year 
loss and impairments on assets acquired decreased by  due to no change in value of remaining assets acquired held during the year ended june  net decrease in net assets from operations net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  was  as compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  of results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income increased  or to  as compared with the prior year ended june  the increase is primarily due to increases in interest income of  other fees of  partially offset by a decrease in leasing income of  which was generated by the leasing activities of elk s subsidiaries 
the increase in interest income is primarily the result of an increase of  in the net loan portfolio at june  as compared to june   due to new loan receivable fundings in excess of payoffs and settlements of loans receivable  as well as the impact of higher average rates charged on new or modified loans 
the decrease in leasing income was primarily due to sales of medallions and autos that were previously leased 
operating expenses interest expense for the year ended june  increased or to  when compared to the year ended june  salaries and employee benefits increased  or when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the costs associated with the hiring of a new executive and employee during the year ended june  as well as increases that were put in effect from amended officer employment agreements 
occupancy costs increased  or  when compared with the year ended june  due to increased office space utilized for the new executive  as well as increased overhead expenses 
professional fees increased  or when compared with the prior year 
miscellaneous administrative expenses increased  or when compared with the prior year 
loss and impairments on assets acquired decreased by  due to fewer write downs of related assets 
net increase in net assets from operations net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  was  as compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  of balance sheet total assets decreased by  as of june  when compared to total assets as of june  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the investments at fair value of  which is attributable to a sale of an interest in medallion loans  payoffs and settlements in excess of new loans during the fiscal year 
prepaid expenses increased  the company incurred costs related to prepaid stock offering cost and cost associated with the pending sale agreement of the company s medallion loans receivable 
the sale of the interest in medallion loans were sold during the fiscal year for proceeds of  in addition  elk s proceeds from banks for the fiscal year were  versus  in repayments made on notes payable from banks 
this resulted in net decrease of  in its short term bank borrowings for the fiscal year ended june  asset liability management interest rate sensitivity ameritrans  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets rise or fall at a different rate over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of its credit facilities with banks and subordinated sba debentures 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from ameritrans interest rate sensitivity gap  ie the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
ameritrans interest rate sensitive assets were approximately  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were approximately  at june  having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on the average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and inter est rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  ameritrans anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
ameritrans believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
interest rate swap agreements ameritrans manages the exposure of its portfolio to increases in market interest rates by entering into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates and by incurring fixed rate debt consisting primarily of subordinated sba debentures 
on october   elk entered into two interest rate swap transactions for  each  with expiration dates of october  and october   respectively 
as a portion of the company s loan portfolio is at fixed rates  elk entered into these swap transactions to hedge against an upward movement in interest rates relating to outstanding bank debt 
on october   one swap expired 
the swap transaction expiring october   provides for a fixed rate of 
if the company s floating borrowing rate the one month libor rate plus falls below the fixed rate  elk is obligated to pay the bank the difference in rates 
if the company s floating borrowing rate rises above the fixed rate  the bank is obligated to pay elk the difference in rates 
as of june   the floating borrowing rate was above the fixed rates 
investment considerations in the fiscal year ended june   the company was affected by steady decreases in libor due to the federal reserve s decrease in interest rates 
this decrease had a direct result on the actual rate the company paid on its lines of credit 
this reduction had a beneficial effect on the company s cost of funds 
however  due to recent activity in the financial markets  the company anticipates paying a higher spread over libor than it currently pays due to a shift in its portfolio and the current market rates 
the dollar amount of the company s adjustable rate loans receivable at june  was approximately million with the remainder being fixed rate loans 
the company s medallion loans generally carry fixed rates 
interest rate increase may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our medallion loans and fixed rate commercial loans because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the differences between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we lend funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates 
as short term interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
however  a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business over time 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to obtain financing from banks or other primary sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions  or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations through private and public placements of its securities  bank financing  the issuance to the sba of its subordinated debentures and internally generated funds 
the company entered into a loan purchase agreement dated july  with medallion financial corp 
and medallion bank pursuant to which the company is selling all of its taxi medallion loans 
the company intends to use the proceeds of sale to pay down its bank lines  to invest in corporate loans and for working capital 
because the company s banks have notified the company that the company s present loan agreements permit business loans secured by real estate or equipment but not investments in corporate loans  the company will be required to seek other sources of financing for its corporate loan strategy and renegotiate the terms of its bank lines of credit for its business loans secured by real estate or equipment 
nb sp  the company is actively pursuing alternative sources of funding 
at june   or  of the company s indebtedness was represented by indebtedness to its banks with interest rates ranging from to  and or  by the debentures issued to the sba with fixed rates of interest plus user fees which results in rates ranging from to 
elk currently may borrow up to  under its existing lines of credit with the banks  subject to the limitations imposed by its borrowing base agreement with its banks and the sba  the statutory and regulatory limitations imposed by the sba and the availability of funds 
contractual obligations expire or mature at various dates through march  the following table shows all contractual obligations at june payments due by period less than year years years years years more than years total floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings operating lease obligations including overhead total our sources of liquidity are credit lines with banks  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  loan amortization and prepayment 
as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
loan amortization and prepayments also provide a source of funding for elk 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
like elk  ameritrans will distribute at least of its investment company taxable income and  accordingly  we will continue to rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in order to provide the funds necessary for our expansion strategy  we expect to raise additional capital and to incur  from time to time  additional bank indebtedness and if deemed necessary by management to obtain sba loans 
there can be no assurances that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms 
the company will require sources of capital in addition to its bank lines of credit and its cash flow from operations to fund its corporate growth strategy 
as a result  the company continues to explore additional options  which may increase available funds for its growth and expansion of this strategy 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures on derivative and hedging activities 
these enhanced disclosures will discuss a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after november   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company does not anticipate a material impact  if any  to the corporation s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary by clarifying that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity 
it requires that changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and shall be applied prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which sh all be applied retrospectively 
we do not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r which establishes principles and requirements on how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value  as well as the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
r also requires certain disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
acquisition costs associated with the business combination will generally be expensed as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective prospectively to business combinations in fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on our fi nancial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas offers companies an irrevocable option to measure most financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
sfas is effective for the company in july the company does not believe sfas will have an impact on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  creates a framework within gaap for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in defining fair value  the statement emphasizes a market based measurement approach that is based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
the statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but does generally apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for the company starting in july since the company already values its investments at fair value  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
the company considers the management of risk essential to conducting its businesses 
accordingly  the company s risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze the company s risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect the board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each co mponent of the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
also  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation might be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan and invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
as interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would have resulted in an additional net increase in net assets from operations of  at june  this is comprised of a change in two components  loans receivable of  at variable interest rate terms  and  for bank debt subject to variable market rates 
this example takes into account the impact of one  interest rate swap the company has in place on its bank debt to mitigate the effects of increases in variable interest rates 
no assurances can be given however  that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates
