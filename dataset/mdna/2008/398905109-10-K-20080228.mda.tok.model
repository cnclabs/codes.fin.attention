item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading operator in the trillion automotive retail industry 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises at dealership locations and collision centers 
we market and sell an extensive range of automotive products and services including new and used vehicles and related financing  vehicle maintenance and repair services  replacement parts  and warranty  insurance and extended service contracts 
our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in alabama  california  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new mexico  new york  oklahoma  south carolina and texas in the united states of america and in the towns of brighton  hailsham and worthing in the united kingdom 
as of december   our retail network consisted of the following three regions with the number of dealerships they comprised i the eastern dealerships in alabama  florida  georgia  louisiana  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york and south carolina  ii the central dealerships in kansas  new mexico  oklahoma and texas  and iii the western dealerships in california 
each region is managed by a regional vice president reporting directly to the chief executive officer and a regional chief financial officer reporting directly to our chief financial officer 
in addition  our international operations consist of three dealerships in the united kingdom also managed locally with direct reporting responsibilities to our corporate management team 
during  as throughout our year history  we grew our business primarily through acquisitions 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealerships that are leaders in their respective market areas 
from january   through december   we have acquired dealership franchises with annual revenues of billion  disposed of or terminated dealership franchises with annual revenues of billion  and been granted four new dealership franchises by our manufacturers 
in alone  we acquired import franchises with expected annual revenues of million 
each acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and the corresponding results of operations of these dealerships are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our interrelated business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  service and collision 
table of contents repair services 
historically  each of these activities has been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  fuel prices and interest rates 
for example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  new vehicle sales may be negatively impacted as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the new vehicle sales impact on our overall business is mitigated by our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services 
we generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
this seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions 
in addition  in some regions of the united states  vehicle purchases decline during the winter months 
as a result  our revenues  cash flows and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters 
other factors unrelated to seasonality  such as changes in economic condition and manufacturer incentive programs  may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income 
for the years ended december   and  we realized net income of million  million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share of  and  respectively 
the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in  and  and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results 
year ended december  asset impairments in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights associated with six of our dealerships to be impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of further  in conjunction with the sale of real estate associated with one of our dealerships  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge 
in addition  we recognized a total of million in additional pretax impairment charges related to the impairment of fixed assets  primarily associated with sold stores and terminated franchises 
lease terminations during the first half of  our results were negatively impacted by million of pretax charges as we terminated real estate leases associated with the sale or termination of two of our domestic brand franchises 
in addition  during  we successfully completed the conversion of all of our stores to operate on the dealer services group of automatic data processing inc adp platform for dealership management services 
as a result  we recognized an additional million in lease termination costs related to these conversions 
loss on bond redemption during the third quarter  we recognized a million pretax charge on the redemption of million of our notes 
year ended december  asset impairments in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights associated with two of our domestic franchises to be impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell one of our ford dealership franchises and  as a result  identified the carrying value of certain fixed assets associated with the dealership to be impaired 
in connection therewith  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million 
hurricanes katrina and rita insurance settlements and new orleans recovery we settled all building  content and vehicle damage and business interruption insurance claims with our insurance carriers in as a result  we recognized an additional million of business interruption proceeds related to covered 
table of contents payroll and fixed cost expenditures incurred during  as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
lease terminations on march   we announced that adp would become the sole dealership management system provider for our existing stores 
we converted a number of our stores from other systems to adp in and settled the lease termination agreement with one of our other system providers for all stores converted as of december  in june  as a result of the significant damage sustained at our dodge store on the east bank of new orleans during hurricane katrina  we terminated our franchise with daimlerchrylser  dealership operations at this store and the associated facilities lease agreement 
as a result of the lease termination  we recognized a million pretax charge 
dealership disposals we disposed of franchises during  resulting in an aggregate pretax gain on sale of million 
severance costs in conjunction with our management realignment from platform to regional structures  we entered into severance agreements with several employees 
in aggregate  these severance costs amounted to million in stock based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors pursuant to our stock option plan  as amended  and employee stock purchase plan  as amended 
historically  we utilized stock options to provide long term incentive to these individuals 
however  beginning in march  we began utilizing restricted stock awards or  at the recipient s election  phantom stock awards  in lieu of stock options 
any future grants of either stock options or restricted stock awards are subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
as a result of adopting financial accounting standards board or fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  on january   we recognized million of additional stock based compensation expense related to stock options and million related to the employee stock purchase plan during the year ended december  our income before income taxes and net income for the year ended december   were million and million lower than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion apb basic and diluted earnings per share were both lower for the year ended december   than if we had continued to account for the stock based compensation under apb year ended december  hurricanes katrina and rita on august   hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast of the united states  including new orleans  louisiana 
at that time  we operated six dealerships in the new orleans area consisting of nine franchises 
two of the dealerships were located in the heavily flooded east bank of new orleans and nearby metairie areas  while the other four were located on the west bank of new orleans  where flood related damage was less severe 
the east bank stores suffered significant damage and were ultimately closed in and the respective franchises terminated 
the west bank stores reopened approximately two weeks after the storm 
on september   hurricane rita came ashore along the texas louisiana border  near houston and beaumont  texas 
at that time  we operated two dealerships in beaumont  texas  consisting of franchises  and nine dealerships in the houston area consisting of seven franchises 
as a result of the evacuation by many residents of houston  and the aftermath of the storm in beaumont  all of these dealerships were closed several days before and after the storm 
all of these dealerships have since resumed normal operations 
at the time of the hurricanes  we estimated the damage sustained at our new orleans area and beaumont dealership facilities and our inventory of new and used vehicles at those locations to be approximately million 
after we applied the terms of our underlying property and casualty insurance policies  we recorded an insurance recovery receivable totaling million and reduced the above noted estimated 
table of contents loss to million 
this loss is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the receivable was established based on our determination  given our experience with these type claims and discussions to date with our insurance carriers  that it is probable that recovery will occur for the amount of these losses and the cost to repair our leased facilities in excess of insurance policy deductibles 
we made the determination of whether recovery was probable in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which defines probable as being likely to occur 
during the fourth quarter  we received total payments on these receivables of million 
we maintain business interruption insurance coverage under which our insurance providers advanced a total of million  subject to final audit under the policies and also subject to settlement adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded approximately million of these proceeds  related to covered payroll and fixed cost expenditures since august   as a reduction to the above noted loss accrual 
final audits and settlement adjustments were made during  resulting in an additional million in insurance proceeds received 
we recorded the remaining million of business interruption insurance proceeds in as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for some of our dealerships  our adoption of emerging issues task force eitf d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  resulted in intangible franchise rights having carrying values that were in excess of their fair values 
this required us to write off the excess value of million  net of deferred taxes of million  or per diluted share  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of asset impairments in connection with the preparation and review of our third quarter interim financial statements  we determined that recent events and circumstances in new orleans indicated that an impairment of goodwill  intangible franchise rights and or other long lived assets may have occurred in the three months ended september  therefore  we performed interim impairment assessments of these assets 
as a result of these assessments  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible franchise right associated with our dodge franchise in new orleans was impaired and recorded a pretax charge of million during the third quarter of due to the then pending disposals of two of our california franchises  a kia and a nissan franchise  we tested the respective asset groups for impairment during the third quarter of these tests resulted in impairments of long lived assets totaling million 
during our annual review of the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december   we determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights related to three of our franchises  primarily a pontiac gmc franchise in the south central region  did not exceed their carrying value and impairment charges were required 
accordingly  we recorded a million pretax impairment charge during the fourth quarter of these items  and other variances between the periods presented  are covered in the following discussion 

table of contents key performance indicators the following table highlights certain of the key performance indicators we use to manage our business consolidated statistical data for the year ended december  unit sales retail sales new vehicle used vehicle total retail sales wholesale sales total vehicle sales gross margin new vehicle retail sales adjusted used vehicle total parts and service sales total gross margin sg a as a of gross profit operating margin pretax margin finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold we monitor a statistic we call adjusted used vehicle gross margin which equals total used vehicle gross profit  which includes the total net profit or loss from the wholesale sale of used vehicles  divided by retail used vehicle sales revenues 
the net profit or loss on wholesale used vehicle sales are included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail used vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following discussion briefly highlights certain of the results and trends occurring within our business 
throughout the following discussion  references are made to same store results and variances  which are discussed in more detail in the results of operations section that follows 
since  our consolidated retail unit sales have increased as improvements in new vehicle sales  as a result of our dealership acquisition activity in each year  outpaced declines in our used retail sales 
we experienced a decline in same store new vehicle retail sales from to as sales at our domestic brand stores weakened  largely consistent with the overall national performance of those brands 
the domestic downturn was partially offset by improvements in our same store import and luxury brands results 
the decrease in our consolidated used vehicle retail sales from to stemmed from a decline in our same store used vehicle sales  partially offset by the impact of our acquisitions 
we continue to take additional steps toward better managing our used vehicle inventory and becoming more critical of the used vehicles we purchase and retain for resale  resulting in decreases in our used wholesale sales from to weakening market conditions spread during from the california and florida markets to a broader portion of the country  including the northeast  which negatively impacted new vehicle gross margins 
overall  new vehicle margins declined from and levels of more than to in  representing declines in both our new car and new truck businesses 
consistent with the gross margin trend  our new vehicle profit per retail unit improved from to  but declined in to  overall  our same store new vehicle margin and profit results were consistent with our consolidated patterns 
our same store new vehicle gross profit per retail unit sold improved for our luxury lines in  but declines in our domestic and import stores offset this 
table of contents improvement 
our same store new vehicle gross margins decreased in both our car and truck lines  as well as across our luxury  import and domestic offerings 
our used vehicle results are directly affected by economic conditions  the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
declining new vehicle markets and manufacturer efforts to stimulate new vehicle sales through incentives created margin pressure in our used vehicle business and contributed to a weaker used vehicle market in as compared to and the variances from to in our adjusted used vehicle gross margin were primarily driven by our retail used vehicle margin  which declined from in and in to in our gross profit per used retail unit decreased in to  from  in  but was up from  in our consolidated parts and service gross margin has steadily increased from in to in during  we implemented initiatives designed to enhance our customers service experience and improve our pricing structure 
our consolidated finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold have increased year over year from to  substantially attributable to improvements in both our retail finance and vehicle service contract segments 
negotiated enhancements to our vehicle service contract pricing structure were implemented during the second and third quarters of  driving an increase in our vehicle service contract income per contract 
our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of gross profit increased basis points to in  as compared to while total gross profit increased from to  our consolidated sg a increased  as a decrease in same store sg a was offset by the impact of our acquisitions 
sg a as a percentage of gross profit decreased from in to in  as a result of the combination of an increase in gross profit and cost reduction initiatives implemented in late and early that were focused on personnel related expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by the adoption of sfas r  share based payment  resulting in compensation expense being recognized related to stock option and employee stock purchase grants 
in addition to the above items  our operating margin for was negatively impacted by a million increase in asset impairments over as a result  operating margin decreased basis points from in to in our operating margin benefited from a million decrease in asset impairments from  resulting in a basis point increase 
in each period  the asset impairments were primarily attributable to identified shortfalls in the fair value of certain intangible franchise rights when compared to the respective capitalized value 
our pretax margin declined from in to in in addition to the factors noted above  the pretax margin as compared to was negatively impacted by an increase in other interest expense  attributable to an additional six months of interest expense on our convertible notes that were issued in june and interest incurred on borrowings under our mortgage facility 
our pretax margin improved basis points from in as a result of the items previously noted and despite an million increase in floorplan interest expense  which was primarily caused by rising interest rates between the two periods 
we believe that our continued growth depends on  among other things  our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new dealerships  while at the same time achieving optimum performance from our diverse franchise mix  attracting and retaining high caliber employees and reinvesting as needed to maintain top quality facilities 
during  we expect to spend million to construct new facilities and upgrade or expand existing facilities  although we expect to finance some of this construction with our mortgage facility as well as with funds from sale and lease back transactions 
in addition  we expect to complete acquisitions of dealerships with million in expected aggregate annual revenues 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement does not require new fair value measurements  but is applied to the extent that other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the 
table of contents assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
companies will be required to disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the inputs used to develop the measurements  and the effect of certain of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after november  in making this shift to a market based measure of fair value  our annual impairment assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets could be significantly impacted 
if changes to our inputs used in determining the estimated weighted average cost of capital the wacc increased the wacc by basis points  and all other assumptions remain constant  the resulting non cash charge for impairment of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights would be approximately million 
no impairment of goodwill would result 
in november  the fasb deferred for one year the implementation of sfas no 
for non financial assets and liabilities 
we anticipate the adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and financial liabilities will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  eg  debt issue costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do no expect sfas to have a material effect on our future results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which significantly changes the accounting for business acquisitions both during the period of the acquisition and in subsequent periods 
the more significant changes in the accounting for acquisitions which could impact our business are certain transaction costs  which are presently treated as cost of the acquisition  will be expensed  restructuring costs associated with a business combination  which are presently capitalized  will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  contingencies  including contingent consideration  which is presently accounted for as an adjustment of purchase price  will be recorded at fair value with subsequent adjustments recognized in operations  and valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets  which are presently considered to be subsequent changes in consideration and are recorded as decreases in goodwill  will be recognized up front and in operations 
sfas no 
r is effective for us on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with an exception related to the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired contingencies related to acquisitions completed before the effective date 
sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
to require adjustments  made after the effective date of this statement  to valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and income tax positions to be recognized as income tax expense 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
r on our business and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued for comment an exposure draft of a proposed fasb staff position apb a proposed fsp that would change the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments  including our convertible notes 
under the proposed new rules  for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion  an entity should separately account for the liability and equity 
table of contents components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s economic interest cost 
the effect of the proposed new rules for our convertible notes is that the equity component would be included in the paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes 
higher interest expense would result by recognizing the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount as interest expense over the expected term of the convertible notes using an effective interest rate method of amortization 
we are currently evaluating the proposed new rules and the impact on our current accounting for the convertible notes 
however  if the proposed fsp is adopted in its current form  we expect to recognize additional interest expense in the period implemented due to the interest expense accretion associated with the convertible notes and to report greater than previously reported interest expense in all prior periods presented due to retrospective application 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies we use and the estimates and assumptions we make during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
inventories 
we carry our new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as our parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus the cost of reconditioning  added equipment and transportation 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operation as the vehicles are sold 
as the market value of our inventory typically declines over time  we establish reserves based on our historical loss experience and market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of our inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is determined based on industry data  primarily accessed via our used vehicle management software and the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
our valuation risk is mitigated  somewhat  by how quickly we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
retail finance  insurance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
further  through agreements that we have with certain vehicle service contract administrators  we earn volume incentive rebates and interest income on reserves  as well as participate in the underwriting profits of the products 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical chargeback results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while our chargeback results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical chargeback results used in determining our estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed our reserve at december   by approximately million 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform the annual impairment assessment at the end of each calendar year  or more frequently if events or circumstances at a reporting unit occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
based on the organization and management of our business prior to  each of our groups of dealerships formerly referred to as platforms qualified as reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment 
however  with our reorganization into three regions in  and the corresponding changes in our management  operational and reporting structure we determined that goodwill should be evaluated at a regional level 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margins  future selling  general and administrative expenses and an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of our industry  our recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions change  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with the reporting unit s 
intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under our franchise agreements with manufacturers 
our dealerships franchise agreements are for various terms  ranging from one year to an indefinite period 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue indefinitely and  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period 
therefore  we do not amortize the carrying amount of our franchise rights 
franchise rights acquired in acquisitions prior to july   were not separately recorded  but were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain a part of goodwill at december  and  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
like goodwill  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we test our franchise rights for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment  using a fair value method 
at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf  the sec staff issued staff announcement no 
d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  which states that for business combinations after september   the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
rather  a direct value method should be used to determine the fair value of all intangible assets other than goodwill required to be recognized under sfas no 
 business combinations 
additionally  registrants who have applied a residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing under sfas no 
 shall perform an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using a residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  to test the carrying value of each individual franchise right for impairment under eitf d  we use a discounted cash flow based approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding the cash flows directly attributable to the franchise right  revenue growth rates  future gross margins and future selling  general and administrative expenses 
using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  estimated residual values 
table of contents at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 
for some of our dealerships  the adoption of the annual impairment provisions as of january   resulted in a fair value that was less than the carrying value of their intangible franchise rights 
as a result  a non cash charge of million  net of deferred taxes of million  was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with the transitional rules of eitf d in the first quarter of if any one of the above assumptions change  including in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our intangible franchise rights estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
for example  if our assumptions regarding the future interest rates used in our estimated weighted average cost of capital used in our impairment analysis increased by basis points  and all other assumptions remain constant  the resulting non cash impairment charge would increase by million 
self insured property and casualty reserves 
we are self insured for a portion of the claims related to our property and casualty insurance programs  requiring us to make estimates regarding expected losses to be incurred 
we engage a third party actuary to conduct a study of the exposures under the self insured portion of our worker s compensation and general liability insurance programs for all open policy years 
we update this actuarial study on an annual basis and make the appropriate adjustments to our accrual 
actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on our historical claims experience adjusted for loss trending and loss development factors 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could influence our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the historical loss history used in determining our estimate of future losses would have changed our reserve for these losses at december   by million 
for workers compensation and general liability insurance policy years ended prior to october   this component of our insurance program included aggregate retention stop loss limits in addition to a per claim deductible limit 
due to our historical experience in both claims frequency and severity  the likelihood of breaching the aggregate retention limits described above was deemed remote  and as such  we elected not to purchase this stop loss coverage for the policy years beginning november   and our exposure per claim under the  plans is limited to million per occurrence  with unlimited exposure on the number of claims up to million that we may incur 
our maximum potential exposure under all of our self insured property and casualty plans with aggregate retention limits originally totaled million  before consideration of amounts previously paid or accruals we have recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of these amounts  our remaining potential loss exposure under these plans totals approximately million at december  fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
results of operations the same store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us and  in the case of dispositions  ending with the last full month it was owned by us 
same store results also include the activities of our corporate headquarters 
for example  for a dealership acquired in june  the results from this dealership will appear in our same store comparison beginning in for the period july through december  when comparing to july through december results 
the following table summarizes our combined same store results for the twelve months ended december  as compared to and the twelve months ended december  compared to depending on the 
table of contents periods being compared  the stores included in same store will vary 
for this reason  the same store results that are compared to differ from those used in the comparison to total same store data dollars in thousands  except per unit amounts for the year ended december  change change revenues new vehicle retail used vehicle retail used vehicle wholesale parts and service finance  insurance and other total revenues cost of sales new vehicle retail used vehicle retail used vehicle wholesale parts and service total cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses floorplan interest expense gross margin new vehicle retail used vehicle parts and service total gross margin sg a as a of gross profit operating margin finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold the discussion that follows provides explanation for the variances noted above

our total new vehicle retail unit sales and revenues improved from to and from to  due to the contributions of our acquisitions completed in each period  with declines in our same store retail unit sales and revenues partially offsetting these improvements 
same store new vehicle unit sales declined from to and from to  primarily due to results experienced within our domestic nameplates 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our same store domestic unit sales decreased and  for the year ended december   as compared to  our same store domestic nameplates declined 
further  from to  our same store sales of import units decreased  primarily driven by the sales declines in our western region 
partially offsetting the decrease in same store domestic and import unit sales  our luxury brands improved from to by 
in  same store unit sales in our car lines declined  while truck lines decreased 
the decrease from to in same store domestic unit sales of new vehicles was substantially offset by a increase in same store import nameplates and a increase in same store luxury nameplates 
our same store car sales improved from to  while our same store truck sales decreased 
in  we anticipate that total industrywide sales of new vehicles will be lower than and remain highly competitive 
however  the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share  during future periods is difficult to predict and subject to the factors discussed in risk factors 

table of contents the following table sets forth our top same store brands  based on retail unit sales volume  and the percentage changes from year to year  which we believe are generally consistent with the overall market performance of those brands in the areas where we operate 
same store new vehicle unit sales for the year ended december  change change toyota scion ford nissan honda chevrolet dodge lexus bmw mercedes benz acura other total certain of our same store brand sales experienced year over year declines  while others exceeded prior year sales  highlighting the cyclical nature of our business and the need to have a well balanced portfolio of new vehicle brands of which we sell 
the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share  during future periods is difficult to predict 
our same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales decreased basis points from to to 
the sustained slowdown in the national economy  and in certain markets in which we operate  continued to depress new retail vehicle sales and increase competitive pressure on all of our brands  causing the shrinkage in margins 
from to  a decrease in same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales was experienced in all three of our brand groups domestic  import and luxury 
our same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales remained relatively consistent from through in total and in each of our three brand groups 
for the year ended december   compared to  our same store gross profit per retail unit declined to  per unit 
while we improved our same store gross profit per retail unit in our luxury nameplates from to  declines of and in our import and domestic brands  respectively  more than offset these positive results 
during  as compared to  we experienced a same store gross profit per retail unit improvement to  per unit from  although we experienced same store declines in our unit sales of domestic nameplates in versus levels  our ability to retain more gross profit per unit from our sales of these brands including the realization and retention of higher manufacturer incentives and increased profit per unit from sales of import nameplates  largely offset the impact on gross profit of the same store total unit decline 
most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
this assistance varies by manufacturer  but generally provides for a defined amount regardless of our actual floorplan interest rate or the length of time for which the inventory is financed 
the amount of interest assistance we recognize in a given period is primarily a function of the mix of units being sold  as domestic brands tend to provide more assistance  and the specific terms of the respective manufacturers interest assistance programs and wholesale interest rates  the average wholesale price of inventory sold  and our rate of inventory turn 
for these reasons  this assistance has ranged from approximately to of our total floorplan interest expense over the past three years 
we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  which therefore impact the gross profit and gross margin detailed above 
the total assistance recognized in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents finally  our total days supply of new vehicle inventory remained constant at days from december  to december   and increased from days supply at december  at december   our days supply of domestic vehicles totaled days and was counterbalanced by import and luxury brands  which equaled days and days supply  respectively 
our days supply at december   was heavily weighted toward our domestic inventory  which stood at days supply  versus our import and luxury brands in which we had a days and days supply  respectively 
we remain focused on reducing our days supply of domestic vehicles

our new vehicle business is a significant source of inventory supply for our used retail operations 
depressed economic conditions in many of the markets that we serve not only negatively impacted our new vehicle results  but also had a detrimental effect on our used vehicle operations as we experienced a deterioration in the number and quality of trade ins and lease turns ins

these declines were primarily attributable to our markets with heavy domestic exposure  as well as our western region 
at times during each of the last three years  manufacturer rebates and below market retail financing rates offered by manufacturers on new vehicles have resulted in a reduction of the price difference to the customer between a late model used vehicle and a new vehicle 
this trend has challenged our used vehicle business to sustain improvement in year over year profitability levels and our same store retail used vehicle gross profit decreased to million in when compared to further  our same store gross profit per retail unit declined and our same store gross margin shrank basis points

thus  our same store wholesale unit sales and revenues declined and  respectively  from to  and and  respectively  from to the change in strategy also meant that marginally profitable used units that were historically sold as wholesale units and partially offset our wholesale losses were sold as retail units

despite the decline in our total used vehicle unit sales and revenue  we experienced a improvement in our total used vehicle gross profit from  as our same store gross profit per used vehicle unit sold increased from  in to  in correspondingly  same store used vehicle gross margin improved from in to in finally  our days supply of used vehicle inventory has increased in each of the last three years from days supply at december   and to days supply at december   and days supply at december  as with new vehicles  although we continuously work to optimize our used vehicle inventory levels  the days supply at december   is slightly below our target and  in all likelihood  will need to be increased in the coming months to provide adequate supply and selection for the spring and summer selling seasons

debt issue costs totaled approximately million and are being amortized over a period of ten years the point at which the holders can first require us to redeem the convertible notes 
the convertible notes rank equal in right of payment to all of our other existing and future senior indebtedness

total cash used in completing the redemption  excluding accrued interest of million  was million 
during  we repurchased approximately million par value of our outstanding notes 
total cash used in completing the redemption  excluding accrued interest of million  was million 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures  exclusive of new or expanded operations  have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
in general  expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer  significant growth in sales at an existing facility  dealership acquisition activity  or manufacturer imaging programs 
during  we plan to invest approximately million  generally funded from excess cash  to expand or relocate existing facilities  excluding the purchase of land and existing buildings  and to perform manufacturer required imaging projects 
acquisitions 
in  we completed acquisitions of franchises with expected annual revenues of approximately million 
these franchises were located in california  georgia  kansas  new york  south carolina and the uk total cash consideration paid  net of cash received  of million  included million for related real estate and the incurrence of million of inventory financing 
during  we completed acquisitions of franchises with expected annual revenues of approximately million 
these franchises were located in alabama  california  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey and oklahoma 
total cash consideration paid  net of cash received  of million  included million for related real estate and the incurrence of million of inventory financing 
from january   through december   we completed acquisitions of seven franchises with expected annual revenues of approximately million 
these franchises were acquired in tuck in acquisitions that complement existing operations in new hampshire  oklahoma and texas 
the aggregate consideration paid in completing these acquisitions was approximately million in cash  net of cash received and the incurrence of million of inventory financing 
our acquisition target for is to complete acquisitions that have million in expected aggregate annual revenues 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships  and borrowings under our floorplan facilities and our acquisition line 
we purchase businesses based on expected return on investment 
generally  the purchase price  excluding real estate and floorplan liabilities  is approximately to of the annual revenue 
thus  our targeted acquisition budget of million is expected to cost us between million and million  excluding the amount incurred to finance vehicle inventories 
subsequent to december   we have not completed the acquisition of any additional franchises 
purchase of convertible note hedge 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes in  we purchased ten year call options on our common stock the purchased options 
under the terms of the purchased options  which become exercisable upon conversion of the convertible notes  we have the right to purchase a total of approximately million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the total cost of the purchased options was million 
the cost of the purchased options results in future income tax deductions that we expect will total approximately million 
in addition to the purchase of the purchased options  we sold warrants in separate transactions the warrants 
these warrants have a ten year term and enable the holders to acquire shares of our common stock from us 
the warrants are exercisable for a maximum of million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment for quarterly dividends in excess of per quarter  liquidation  bankruptcy  or a change in control of our company and other conditions 
subject to these adjustments  the maximum amount of shares of our common stock that could be required to be issued under the warrants is million shares 
the proceeds from the sale of the warrants were million 

table of contents the purchased option and warrant transactions were designed to increase the conversion price per share of our common stock from to a premium to the closing price of our common stock on the date that the convertible notes were priced to investors and  therefore  mitigate the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes  if any 
no shares of our common stock have been issued or received under the purchased options or the warrants 
since the price of our common stock was less than at december   the intrinsic value of both the purchased options and the warrants  as expressed in shares of our common stock  was zero 
changes in the price of our common stock will impact the share settlement of the convertible notes  the purchased options and the warrants as illustrated below shares in thousands net share entitlement shares shares issuable under the issuable potential company under the purchased under net shares eps stock price notes options the warrants issuable dilution in thousands for dilutive earnings per share calculations  we will be required to include the dilutive effect  if applicable  of the net shares issuable under the convertible notes and the warrants as depicted in the table above under the heading potential eps dilution 
although the purchased options have the economic benefit of decreasing the dilutive effect of the convertible notes  for earnings per share purposes we cannot factor this benefit into our dilutive shares outstanding as their impact would be anti dilutive 
stock repurchases 
we generally fund our stock repurchases from excess cash 
in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common shares  and in august  authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common shares 
pursuant to these authorizations  a total of  shares were repurchased at a cost of approximately million  effectively exhausting the combined authorizations

in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible notes  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  exhausting the entire million authorization 

table of contents in addition  under separate authorization  in march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of a number of shares equivalent to the shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan on a quarterly basis 
pursuant to this authorization  a total of  shares were repurchased during  at a cost of approximately million 
approximately million of the funds for such repurchases came from employee contributions during the period 
further  a total of  shares were repurchased in march  at a cost of approximately million 
all such funds came from employee contributions 
in march  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
as of december   million remained under the board of directors march authorization 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million  thereby completing the previously authorized repurchase program 
future repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors after considering our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  existing debt covenants  outlook for our business  general business conditions and other factors 
dividends 
in  our board of directors declared dividends of per common share for each of the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of these dividend payments on our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents totaled million 
during  our board of directors declared dividends of per common share for the fourth quarter of and per common share for the first  second and third quarters of these dividend payments on our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents totaled approximately million for the year ended december  prior to  we had never declared or paid dividends on our common stock 
the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after considering the results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  outlook for our business  general business conditions and other factors 
provisions of our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes require us to maintain certain financial ratios and limit the amount of disbursements we may make outside the ordinary course of business 
these include limitations on the payment of cash dividends and on stock repurchases  which are limited to a percentage of cumulative net income 
as of december   our notes  the most restrictive agreement with respect to such limits  limited future dividends and stock repurchases to million 
this amount will increase or decrease in future periods by adding to the current limitation the sum of of our consolidated net income  if positive  and of equity issuances  less actual dividends or stock repurchases completed in each quarterly period

we  acting through our subsidiaries  are the lessee under many real estate leases that provide for our use of the respective dealership premises 
generally  our real estate and facility leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three additional five year terms  at our option 
pursuant to these leases  our subsidiaries generally agree to indemnify the lessor and other parties from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities  or a breach of the lease by the lessee 
additionally  from time to time  we enter into agreements in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the purchaser  or other parties  from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services  we enter into agreements that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement 
from time to time  primarily in connection with dealership dispositions  our subsidiaries assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser the subsidiaries interests in any real property leases associated with such stores 
in general  our subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform  whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease 
additionally  we and our subsidiaries generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by us and our subsidiaries in connection with such leases 
although we generally have indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non performance under these leases  as well as certain defenses  and we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases  we estimate that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately million at december  we and our subsidiaries also may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases  such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease  although we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time 
our exposure under these leases is difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance of us or our subsidiaries required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
interest rates 
we have interest rate risk in our variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps 
at december   fixed rate debt  primarily consisting of our convertible notes and notes outstanding  totaled million and had a fair value of million 
at december   we had million of variable rate floorplan borrowings outstanding  million of variable rate mortgage facility borrowings outstanding and million of variable rate acquisition facility borrowings outstanding 
based on the aggregate amount  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an million change to our interest expense 
after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  a basis point increase would yield a net increase of million 
we received million of interest assistance from certain automobile manufacturers during the year ended december  this assistance is reflected as a million reduction of our new vehicle cost of sales for the 
table of contents year ended december   and reduced our new vehicle inventory by million and million at december  and  respectively 
for the past three years  the reduction to our new vehicle cost of sales has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future interest assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased assistance from certain manufacturers 
we may use interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements when appropriate based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt 
during  we entered into eight interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million  comprised of one swap with a million notional value that effectively locks in an interest rate of approximately and the remaining seven swaps each with a notional value of million that effectively lock in an interest rate ranging from to 
all of the swaps entered into expire in the latter half of in december  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional values of million each  and in january  we entered into a third interest rate swap with a notional value of million 
one swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of  the second swap  also with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of  and the third swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of 
all three of the hedge instruments expire december  at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss totaled million 
at december   net unrealized gains  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss totaled million 
the increase in net unrealized losses from to was primarily a result of the additional swaps added in and the decline in interest rates experienced during the year 
at december  net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss totaled million 
at december   and  all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk the functional currency of our uk subsidiaries is the pound sterling 
we intend to remain permanently invested in these foreign operations and  as such  do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
if we change our intent with respect to such international investment  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would have resulted in an million change to our revenues for the year ended december
