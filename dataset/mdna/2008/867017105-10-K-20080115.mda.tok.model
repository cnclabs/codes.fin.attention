critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the disclosure of contingencies 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be materially different from those estimates 
the following policies are those that we consider to be the most critical 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for further description of these and all other accounting policies 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consist of balances due from sales 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses based on historical experience and other information available to management 
as of september  and  we established an allowance of  and  respectively 

table of contents inventories inventories  which consist of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market value  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and obsolescence when considered necessary 
as of september  and  we established an allowance of  and  respectively 
software costs we capitalize certain costs associated with software development in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb no 
fasb no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we amortize software costs for periods of to years  the estimated useful life of the asset 
at september  and  the company capitalized software costs amounting to  and  respectively 
during  the company sold the outstanding shares of percipia where most of the software costs were incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
pursuant to fasb statement no 
fasb no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb no 
the company tests goodwill for impairment as of september of each year and  more frequently  if a triggering event occurs utilizing a valuation study 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
in performing this assessment  management uses the income approach and the similar transactions method of the market approach to develop the fair value of the reporting unit in order to assess its potential impairment of goodwill 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow model which relies on a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
rates used to discount future cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
the similar transactions method is a market approach methodology in which the fair value of a business is estimated by analyzing the prices at which companies similar to the subject  which are used as guidelines  have sold in controlling interest transactions mergers and acquisitions 
target companies are compared to the subject company  and multiples paid in transactions are analyzed and applied to subject company data  resulting in value indications 
comparability can be affected by  among other things  the product or service produced or sold  geographic markets served  competitive position  profitability  growth expectations  size  risk perception  and capital structure 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
as of september   we were not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of goodwill for impairment 
based upon the most recent assessment as of september   the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately million 
asset impairment of  was recorded relating to percipia s goodwill during the year ended september  see note goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements included herein in item management believes the most significant assumptions which would have an effect on the estimated fair value of goodwill are the growth rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
at september   the company used a growth rate of for  for  for  for and for the weighted average cost of capital used was 
management estimates that a one percentage point increase in the weighted average cost of capital results in a million excess of carrying value of the reporting unit over estimated fair value and a one percentage decrease in the sales growth rate would result in a million excess of estimated fair value over carrying value of the reporting unit 
fasb no 
also requires that customer lists and intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets fasb no 

customer lists are stated at fair value based on the discounted cash flows over the estimated life of the customer contracts and relationships 
we used a consulting firm to perform a valuation study at the time of acquisition of middleton to determine the value and estimated life of customer lists purchased in order to assist management in determining an appropriate method in which to amortize the asset 
the amortization life is based on historic analysis of customer relationships combined with estimates of expected future revenues from customer accounts 
middleton has applied the same acquisition method on all of the subsequent acquisitions 
we previously amortized customer lists on a straight line basis over the expected life of the customer of years 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed an extensive analysis to reassess the expected life of the customer lists and concluded that the expected life of the customer should be adjusted from years to years 
the change in the estimated useful life used to account for customer lists resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors  including actual customer attrition data  demand  and competition 
the pertinent factors have been influenced by management s ongoing customer retention programs  as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery  customer satisfaction  and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  fasb no 
the change in estimated useful life of customer lists is accounted for prospectively 
the effect of the change in estimated useful life for customer lists increased the loss from continuing operations and net loss by approximately  each and decreased basic and diluted earnings per share by for impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with fasb no 
 we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceed the estimated fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
revenue recognition service revenues are recorded and recognized at the date of service completion 
sales revenues are recorded when products are shipped  title has passed to unaffiliated customers  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
installation revenues are considered earned at the time the project is completed 
maintenance contracts are recorded as unearned revenues at the time of collection and are recognized as income monthly over the term of the contract 
interest and dividends earned on investments are recorded when earned 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider estimates of future taxable income 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and fsp fin  which amended certain provisions of fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that the company determine whether the benefits of the company s tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the provisions of fin also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of the calendar year  with the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on its future results of operations and financial position 
we currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on the available objective evidence  management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future 
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit net income in the period in which such determination is made if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  amounting to approximately million  begin to expire in recent accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect  if any  on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically and as of september   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize market risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates results from the variable rate of our credit facility with wachovia bank  national association 
an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflow and lower borrowing capacity 
the interest rate on our credit facility is compounded daily based upon the libor rate  plus a variable percentage based on our leverage ratio 
the effect of each increase in the libor rate on our credit facility would result in an annual increase in interest expense of less than million 
we do not believe that near term changes in the interest rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
exchange rate risk we generally conduct business in us dollars  and as a result  we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency risk through our operations in the telephone communications business 
foreign currency risk arises from transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary foreign currency to which we are exposed is the british pound sterling  telecom fm s functional local currency 
we do not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements 
our consolidated balance sheets are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period of the income statement 
translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income and expenses 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
