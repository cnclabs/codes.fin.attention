business units results of individual business units are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  therefore  the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
the management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units 
methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change 
the costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services or are included in other and unallocated in the table above 
management evaluates results of operations of the business units before non cash pension income  charges related to the fox river environmental reserves  restructuring related charges  unusual items  certain corporate level costs  effects of asset dispositions and insurance recoveries because it believes this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core papermaking businesses  the profitability of business units and the extent of cash flow generated from core operations 
such amounts are presented under the caption other and unallocated 
this presentation is closely aligned with the management and operating structure of our company 
it is also on this basis that the company s performance is evaluated internally and by the company s board of directors
