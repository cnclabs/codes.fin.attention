table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel  first in class treatments for central nervous system conditions and other serious unmet medical needs 
our most advanced product candidate  viprinex ancrod  is in phase clinical testing as a novel investigational drug for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
stroke is one of the most prevalent  debilitating and costly diseases in the world  and there are few acceptable treatment options 
viprinex is a fibrinogen reducing agent that is designed to expand the treatment window from three hours to six hours 
in addition to viprinex  we have rights to receive royalty payments from the sales of namenda memantine hcl  an approved drug marketed for alzheimer s disease 
we also have rights to receive payments from the development of another investigational drug which is in phase clinical trials for the treatment of swelling associated with cerebral tumors 
our earlier stage pipeline also includes rights to two proteins in preclinical development for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease 
below is an overview of key developments affecting our business over the course of fiscal financing activity in september we implemented a one for seven reverse stock split and then in november completed an underwritten offering of approximately million shares of common stock  at a price of per share  raising million in gross proceeds 
after underwriting commissions and expenses  net proceeds of the offering were million 
all share and per share information contained in this report reflect the stock split and historical numbers have been restated to reflect the split 
viprinex  our phase investigational drug for acute ischemic stroke we are currently conducting two phase clinical trials of viprinex ancrod for acute ischemic stroke 
the trials are referred to as ancrod stroke program i and ancrod stroke program ii  or asp i and asp ii 
although patient enrollment in the asp trials in fiscal has been slower than planned  we have recently reached the number of patients required to conduct an interim analysis 
we currently anticipate completing this interim analysis no later than the first quarter of calendar the interim analysis will be conducted based on the outcome of the first patients treated in the studies  aggregated together as a single data set 
for this interim analysis  an independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  will conduct a review of the outcome of the patients receiving viprinex compared to the outcome of patients receiving placebo 
if viprinex does not meet specified minimum efficacy criteria  the dsmb has been instructed to inform us that it is futile for us to continue the trial  and we would then stop the studies 
if the data indicates overwhelming efficacy  the dsmb may recommend stopping the studies for superiority 
in addition to the interim efficacy analysis  the dsmb will also evaluate safety 
if the trials continue following the interim analysis  we will not have access to any efficacy data until the trials are completed and full analysis on all patients has been completed 
xerecept  a phase investigational drug for which we have rights to receive milestone and royalty profit sharing payments celtic continues to develop xerecept corticorelin acetate for the treatment of brain edema associated with cerebral tumors  and has informed us that it expects to report results of a phase clinical trial during late calendar amendment to merz agreement in february  we amended the agreement under which we receive royalties for sales of memantine from merz and cmcc 
we agreed to discontinue receiving royalties on sales of memantine outside of the united states  and agreed to a staged reduction in the royalty rate for sales in the united states 
in return  merz and cmcc agreed that they would not provide us notice of termination of the agreement before an effective date of january  as a result  we expect that we will continue to receive royalty payments from merz through at least january   but the amount of the payments will decrease from historical levels and will continue to decrease over this time 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and the disclosures made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most important and or subjective items used in determining our financial condition and results of operations as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from nonrefundable up front fees where we continue involvement through a service agreement or other obligation is initially classified as deferred revenue  a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we subsequently amortize the deferred revenue into collaboration service revenue in the consolidated statement of operations over the period of our service obligations 
technology and collaboration service revenue is recognized according to the terms of the contractual agreements to which we are a party  when our performance requirements have been fulfilled  the amount is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from license fees with non cancelable  non refundable terms and no future performance obligations is recognized when collection is assured 
milestone payments are recognized when we have fulfilled development milestones and collection is also assured 
revenue from services performed for other parties is recorded during the period in which the expenses are incurred 
as of june   we had million in deferred revenue related to our agreements with celtic 
we are amortizing this into the consolidated statement of operations on a straight line basis through november  when our service obligations to celtic are scheduled to end 
royalty revenue is generally recorded when payments are received  which is often one quarter after the period in which the products sales have occurred  because there is no information available to us on the product sales until the time we receive the royalty payment 
revenue arrangements with multiple components are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered component has stand alone value to the customer  and whether there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are identified and applied to each of the units 
research and development expenses our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development includes clinical trial costs  development and manufacturing costs for investigational drugs  payments to clinical and contract research organizations  compensation expenses for drug development personnel  consulting and advisor costs  preclinical studies and other costs related to development of our product candidates 
research and development expenses include expenses that are incurred over multiple reporting periods  such as fees for contractors and consultants  patient treatment costs related to clinical trials and investigational drug manufacturing costs 
we assess the level and related costs of the services provided during each reporting period  including the percentage of work completed through each reporting period  to determine the portion to expense in each period 
the assessment of the percentage of work completed that determines the amount of research and development expense that should be recognized in a given period sometimes requires significant judgment 
we apply our judgment and base our estimates on historical experience and the information available at the time of reporting 
estimates involved in determining fair value of investments we estimate the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities  or ars  based on models of discounted cash flow and assumptions regarding future interest rates 
the company s investments in ars were initially structured to provide liquidity via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals 
beginning in february  failed auctions occurred throughout the ars market  and since then all auctions for our ars have been unsuccessful 
while the credit rating of these securities remains high and the ars are paying interest according to their terms  as a result of the potentially long maturity and lack of liquidity for ars  we believe that the value of the ars in our portfolio has been impaired 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the ars by  based on our judgment that the decline in value is other than temporary 
models estimating the value of ars are complex and require estimates that can significantly change their value 

table of contents equity financing warrants we have issued warrants in connection with sales of our common stock to raise capital 
we generally account for warrants we issue as a component of stockholders equity when permitted under accounting rules 
however  when the terms of the warrants require registered shares to be delivered to the investors  or require potential cash payments to be made under specified circumstances  we account for the estimated fair value of the warrants as a liability under the terms of emerging issues task force  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
this standard specifies that our ability to deliver registered shares upon an exercise of the warrants and our potential obligation to cash settle the warrants are deemed to be beyond our control  and therefore the value of the warrants must be accounted for as a liability 
as with stock based compensation  there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in determining the input values needed to estimate the fair value of the warrants 
changes in these assumptions  particularly the estimated volatility  can materially affect the resulting estimates of the fair values of the warrants on our consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees using an estimate of the fair value of the stock option on the date that it is granted 
this estimated fair value is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying stock option  generally four years for employees and one to three years for directors 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in estimating the input values needed to estimate the fair value of stock options 
changes in these assumptions  particularly the estimated volatility and the estimated term of the options  can materially affect the resulting estimates of the fair values of the options that are granted 
in addition  the expenses recorded for stock based compensation in our financial statements may differ significantly from the actual value realized by the recipients of the stock options the stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in little or no value to the recipient  or the stock options may be exercised when the stock price is significantly in excess of the option exercise price  resulting in value to the recipient greater than that estimated by the fair values reported in consolidated financial statements 
under accounting requirements  the expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements are not adjusted to the actual amounts realized by stock option recipients 
users of the financial statements should understand that the expenses we recognize for stock based compensation will not result in any payment of cash by us 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a market based hierarchy for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value  but it does not expand or require any new fair value measures 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively and are effective for our fiscal year beginning july  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 delaying the effective date for non financial assets and liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november   except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf  which requires nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or services are performed 
eitf will be effective for our fiscal year beginning july  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property eitf 
eitf addresses arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market products when the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
eitf requires collaborators in such virtual joint venture arrangements to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis  and to report any payments received from or made to its other collaborators based on other applicable accounting guidance 
eitf is effective for collaborative arrangements in place at the beginning of annual periods beginning after december   for us this will be the fiscal year beginning july   and we will evaluate what effect  if any  the adoption of eitf will have on our consolidated financial statements at a later date 

table of contents results of operations revenues the major components of our revenue are as follows in thousands increase decrease fiscal year ended june  from prior year royalty xerecept sale collaboration services technology sale and collaboration services total revenues of  for fiscal year ended june  decreased by  from revenues of  in fiscal our fiscal revenues consisted of  from royalties on the commercial sales of memantine by merz and its marketing partners   recognized from the fiscal sale of our rights and interests in xerecept to celtic  and  from the reimbursement of the direct expenses incurred for services provided to celtic for administering the phase clinical trials and manufacturing of xerecept in the united states 
royalties were higher for fiscal year compared to fiscal because of higher sales of memantine by merz and its marketing partners 
royalty payments we receive for future periods will be based on an amended royalty structure with merz  and we will no longer receive royalties for sales of memantine outside the united states  which were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of xerecept were the same for fiscal and because we are recognizing the up front payment of million we received in november on a straight line basis over the estimated term of our obligations  which extends to november revenues from collaboration services declined by  or  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal because we have transitioned most of the xerecept drug development work to celtic 
revenues of  in fiscal increased by  compared to revenues of  in fiscal all categories for which we report revenue increased from the prior year 
the amount we recognize from the sale of xerecept increased by  because our collaboration and service agreement with celtic was in place for the full twelve months of fiscal  as compared to approximately seven months during fiscal collaboration services revenue also increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal because  likewise  there was a twelve month period in fiscal over which we provided services to celtic as compared to seven months in fiscal royalty revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of higher sales of memantine by merz and its marketing partners 
in future periods  we expect to record revenue from the sale of our rights and assets related to xerecept in the amount of million annually through november  unless the agreements with celtic are modified 
we expect revenue from collaboration services to decline further since celtic has directly assumed many of the responsibilities we previously handled on its behalf 
we expect royalty revenue to decrease in future periods because we will no longer receive royalties on sales of memantine for alzheimer s disease in europe and there will be a staged reduction in royalty rates for sales in the united states 
research and development expenses because we are in the business of drug development and our current drug candidates have not been approved for sale  our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development includes clinical trial costs  development and manufacturing costs for investigational drugs  payments to clinical and contract research organizations  compensation expenses for drug development personnel  consulting and advisor costs  preclinical studies and other costs related to development of our product candidates 
the following table shows our research and development costs by product under development in thousands increase decrease fiscal year ended june  from prior year viprinex for stroke xerecept preclinical programs for alzheimer s and huntington s diseases 
table of contents the majority of our research and development efforts are focused on viprinex  a phase investigational drug for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke which we acquired rights to in july since acquiring these rights we have established gmp manufacturing capability and initiated two large  international  well controlled  double blind  randomized phase studies designed to determine whether viprinex is a safe and effective treatment for stroke when given within six hours of onset 
for fiscal year  our expenditures on viprinex aggregated  an increase of from expenses of  for fiscal in fiscal year the viprinex clinical trials and associated costs increased  due to an increase in salaries and benefits as we hired additional personnel to oversee the clinical trials and qualify additional investigator sites for enrollment of patients  increased costs for training clinical investigators  increased clinical trial site expenses and lab costs 
the increased clinical trial costs were partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses of  following the completion of certain development work on the nordmark snake facility in the fiscal year the active ingredient in viprinex is derived from the venom of the malayan pit viper 
for fiscal year  viprinex expenses increased to  compared to expenses of  in fiscal the increase in our expenditures for viprinex was due to increased manufacturing costs  related to costs of developing the snake farm  manufacturing and purification processes  and completing finished drug supply for use in the clinical trials and stability testing for the drug 
clinical costs also increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as we hired additional employees to manage the increase in enrollment and number of sites in our phase clinical trials of viprinex 
for fiscal year  our expenditures for xerecept of  decreased  from  in fiscal following our earlier sale of xerecept to celtic  during fiscal we transitioned substantially all drug development activities to celtic and are no longer incurring these costs 
the decrease in our research and development costs for xerecept is comparable to the decrease in revenue for reimbursement of these costs by celtic 
in future periods  we expect our costs and comparable reimbursement revenues for xerecept to be similar to the levels of fiscal expenses for the xerecept program decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal because our agreement with celtic was in place for the full fiscal compared to only a portion of fiscal  and we began transitioning activities to celtic which we previously handled directly  reducing costs that we incurred 
in fiscal we entered into two collaboration and license agreements with the buck institute for age research  or buck  for the development of proteins in preclinical development for the treatment of alzheimer s and huntington s diseases 
under the agreements  we fund specified preclinical research work as performed by buck in return for development rights to the proteins that are the subject of their research 
there were no comparable costs for fiscal or if our research funding continues at the current level for fiscal  we expect research costs for these proteins to be approximately million 
through june   we have incurred approximately million of direct expenses on the development of viprinex since our acquisition of empire in july  when we acquired the rights to viprinex 
these expenses are in addition to viprinex related expenditures of approximately million which we recorded as in process research and development expenses related to our acquisition of empire 
we presently cannot estimate the cost of completing the development work on viprinex required to receive approval from the fda and begin marketing the drug candidate 
these costs cannot be estimated because we are unable to reliably estimate future enrollment rates into the studies  and costs are highly dependent on the enrollment rates 
if the rate of enrollment decreases from recent levels  it will take a longer period of time to complete the clinical trials  resulting in higher total costs  in such a case it is possible that we may not even be able to complete the trials 
in addition  the outcome of the trials may not support an fda approval of the drug candidate  or the fda may require additional trials after reviewing the outcome of the current trials 
we expect fiscal research and development costs to increase for the viprinex program as additional patients are enrolled into our clinical trials  although we are still seeking to reduce expenses in areas where possible 
acquired in process research and development expenses we acquired empire pharmaceuticals  inc in july to obtain the worldwide rights to viprinex 
in connection with the acquisition  a portion of the purchase price we agreed to pay was contingent upon our commencement of phase clinical trials 
after we started these trials in november  we made the contingency payment of  consisting of cash of  and  shares of common stock valued at  because the contingency was fulfilled and no further contingency payments were included in the agreement to acquire empire  this item did not recur in fiscal or 
table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive management  finance  business development and human resources  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and audit  and facilities costs such as rent and insurance 
general and administrative expenses were as follows in thousands increase from fiscal year ended june  prior year general and administrative expenses  which include costs relating to our corporate operations in california and administrative operations for our office in new jersey  were  for fiscal  a increase from the expenses of  for fiscal the increase of  for fiscal is due primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits after we hired additional personnel during the latter half of fiscal to address the earlier material weaknesses in our internal control  and an increase in legal and consulting fees related to new contracts entered into during the fiscal period  both partially offset by a reduction in audit and consulting fees following our hiring of the additional administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal increased by  compared to expenses of  in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from increases for consultants and audit fees associated with a restatement of our financial statements  and higher employee salaries for employees hired during the year  partially offset by lower legal fees 
we are currently conducting a review of our operating structure and expenses  seeking areas in general and administrative expenses where there are potential cost savings 
interest expense interest expense relates to charges incurred for a bridge financing transaction in fiscal for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal years or impairment charge for decrease in fair value of investments we recorded a charge of  for the fiscal year ended june  for the decrease in value of our investments in ars 
ars were structured to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals 
beginning in february  auctions failed to settle for the ars held in our investment portfolio and we believe the value of these investments have been impaired 
we recorded a charge for the impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year based on a model of discounted future cash flows and assumptions regarding interest rates 
there were no comparable charges for the periods in fiscal or interest income interest income was  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  compared to the fiscal year ended june  the increased interest income in fiscal was due to our higher cash and investments balances following the underwritten public offering in november  more than offsetting the decline in interest rates between the periods 
interest income increased by  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  primarily due to higher cash and investment balances in fiscal non cash gain on decrease in fair value of warrants the non cash gain on decrease in fair value of warrants was  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  from the gain recorded in fiscal there was no comparable item in fiscal the non cash gain on decrease in fair value of warrants represents changes in the black scholes value of warrants we issued in april  and this has occurred primarily as a result of the decrease in the price of our common stock for each of the fiscal and reporting periods 
the april warrants require us to provide the investors with registered shares upon the warrants exercise 
the warrants may also require cash payments to be made in connection with certain fundamental transactions involving us or our common stock 
because accounting rules specify that delivery of registered shares is beyond the control of the company that issued the warrants  and also because in some circumstances there may be cash payments to the investors in lieu of a warrant exercise  we are required to account for the value of these warrants as a liability 
we have estimated the liability based on the black scholes option pricing model  and this warrant liability is re valued on each reporting date with changes in the fair value from prior periods reported as a non cash charge or gain to earnings 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we assess liquidity primarily by the cash and investments available to fund our operations  which are primarily related to the continuation of the phase clinical trials of viprinex for acute ischemic stroke  the continued development of viprinex manufacturing processes  and the administrative expenses of operating as a public company 
we also assess liquidity by the working capital  modified to exclude deferred revenue and the warrant liability  available to fund operations 
we exclude deferred revenue and the warrant liability from our working capital in the table below as we do not believe these items will ever require payments from our funds 
the following table shows our cash and short term investments and working capital in thousands 
june  june  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments working capital excluding deferred revenue and the warrant liability since our inception in  we have applied the majority of our resources to our research and development programs and have generated only limited operating revenue 
we have experienced operating losses in nearly every year since inception as we have funded the development and clinical testing of our drug candidates 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
as of june   our combined balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million from the balance at the end of our prior fiscal year at june  the combined balance including long term investments increased by million 
our working capital excluding deferred revenue and the warrant liability increased by million 
the increases were a result of million in net proceeds received from our sale of common stock in november  partially offset by the operating activities of conducting our clinical trials and other operations as a company  which used approximately million in cash and short term investments 
we have classified approximately million of our auction rate securities as long term investments due to their current lack of liquidity 
we believe that our cash and investments long and short term combined as of june  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least the next twelve months 
this estimate is based on the clinical trial scenario which assumes that we continue our two clinical trials beyond the interim analysis and enrollment into the trials increases from recent levels 
if the dsmb recommends that the trials be stopped for futility or superiority  our cash and investments will last for a longer period of time as we would no longer incur on going expenses for the current clinical trials 
the estimates of our future liquidity will be materially impacted by our success or failure in enrolling patients into our viprinex clinical trials 
either success or failure could increase our operating expenses  as success would involve additional incremental costs of the additional patients and a faster outflow of funds to pay these costs 
failure to enroll patients at the anticipated rate may require us to initiate additional potentially costly activities as we attempt to reach our targeted enrollment  and we will still incur fixed costs for our operations and the sites eligible to enroll patients 
we may seek to raise additional funds when market conditions permit  however  there can be no assurance that funding will be available or that  if available  it will be on acceptable terms 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the time and cost involved in completing the clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for viprinex  the value we are able to receive upon our disposition of the auction rate securities we hold as long term investments  the royalties received from merz for future sales of memantine  the receipt of milestone  royalty and profit sharing payments pursuant to our agreements with celtic  the progress of our clinical development programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the acquisition or licensing of new drug candidates  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish collaborative relationships  the development of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the cost of our research collaborations with the buck institute for age research 

table of contents contractual obligations our total noncancelable obligations are summarized in the following table in thousands payments due by period less than over total year years years operating lease obligations manufacturing commitment total under our agreement for supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in viprinex with nordmark  we have agreed to make a termination payment of up to  in the event we cancel the agreement prior to the commercialization of viprinex 
although we presently have no intention to cancel the agreement  the cancellation payment is a potential contractual obligation and is therefore included in the table 
in the event that the current clinical trials are stopped for futility  we believe we would cancel the agreement as soon as we determine that further development of viprinex is unlikely 
our obligation in euros has been translated at a june  exchange rate of approximately per euro 
in addition to our noncancelable contractual obligations  to develop our product candidates  particularly viprinex  we periodically enter into agreements that require us to make regular payments to various parties in the normal course of business 
because we generally provide for our ability to terminate these agreements with a day termination notice  we do not believe that our noncancelable contractual obligations at june  are material  except when a cancellation penalty may be required as noted in the table above 
for a more thorough understanding of certain obligations relating to our business  even though they may be terminated  the following additional considerations are provided as convenience 
active ingredient production purification and operation of a snake farm 
raw venom of the malayan pit viper is the starting material for the active ingredient in viprinex  and is produced by nordmark in germany where they maintain a colony of snakes in a manufacturing facility 
we have agreed to make monthly payments to nordmark for our supply of the active ingredient and for the fully burdened costs of operating the snake farm until such time as either the agreement is terminated or commercial production commences 
if the agreement is terminated by us prior to commercialization  we are required to make a termination payment of up to million or approximately million to nordmark 
finished product manufacturing 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient produced by nordmark is shipped to baxter pharmaceutical solutions llc in the united states for production of the finished drug product 
we make payments to baxter based on the work performed 
we have the right to cancel the agreement  provided we pay for the services performed up to the time of termination plus a portion of manufacturing work that has been scheduled but not completed 
clinical research organizations for assistance overseeing the clinical trials 
we have agreements in place with various clinical research organizations for work needed on the clinical trials in various foreign countries 
we generally pay the cros on a monthly basis for work as it is performed  and the terms of the agreements allow them to be cancelled with no obligations beyond the costs incurred by the cros to the time of termination 
medical facilities conducting the clinical trials 
we generally pay medical facilities for each patient enrolled into our trials  and withhold a portion of total site compensation until all data required in the clinical trial protocol is received 
the portion withheld is recorded as a liability in our consolidated financial statements 
data management 
we pay outside service organizations on a monthly or quarterly basis for services related to managing the data collected from the clinical trial 
license agreement for viprinex 
we have an exclusive worldwide license for all human therapeutic indications for viprinex from abbott 
under this license  we have an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop viprinex for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
milestone payments of up to million are due to abbott upon various regulatory approvals of viprinex  and if viprinex is approved we will be required to make royalty payments to abbott based on worldwide viprinex sales 
we are unable to estimate if and when viprinex may be approved 
in the event we sublicense the rights to viprinex  additional payments may be due to abbott based on the terms of the sublicense 
we have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience upon providing days notice to abbott  and abbott has the right to terminate the agreement only in the event of our breach 
employees 
all of our employees are employed on an at will basis 
buck institute for age research 
we have entered into agreements with buck for rights to preclinical proteins for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease 
these agreements may be extended annually and we have the right to terminate the agreements upon days notice if we determine the research program objectives cannot be substantially met 
in addition  we have certain milestone obligations to buck in the event that specified research goals are met 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices designed to help us protect against these and other exposures 
we do not anticipate material potential losses in these areas  but no policies or business practices can protect against all risks  and there is always a chance that unanticipated risks could arise and create losses for us 
we invest funds not needed for near term operating expenses in diversified short term and long term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of june   the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments maturing in one year or less was million and represented of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our available for sale securities due to the general short term nature of our investment portfolio  or the regular resetting of interest rates on the securities we own which have an overall maturity date of more than one year 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
we have two offices in the united states and no offices in foreign locations 
however  the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  in our lead investigational drug  viprinex  is based in germany and our obligations to this manufacturer are denominated in euros 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with clinical trial sites and service providers throughout the world  and as a result have payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies 
because we do not maintain any accounts in foreign currencies  decreases in the value of the united states dollar will increase our us dollar costs as additional us dollars would be necessary to pay the same costs denominated in the various foreign currencies 
as of june   we had million invested in ars  issued principally by student loan agencies and generally rated aaa by a major credit rating agency 
our original purchase price for these securities was approximately million  which was subsequently written down to a value of million during the third quarter of fiscal ars are structured to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  which are approximately once a month 
beginning in february  auctions for the securities in our portfolio began to fail  and none have been successful since that time 
we have classified all of our ars as long term investments as of june  and recorded a charge for the decrease in their value 
we have estimated the fair value of these investments based on a model of discounted future cash flows and assumptions regarding interest rates 
if the auctions for these securities continue to fail  the ars may not be readily convertible into cash  and we may be required to take losses on the sale of the securities 
based on our expected cash usage for the next twelve months  we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual for at least twelve months
