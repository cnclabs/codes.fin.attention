business overview we design  develop and license chip interface technologies and architectures that are foundational to nearly all digital electronics products 
our chip interface technologies are designed to improve the time to market  performance and cost effectiveness of our customers semiconductor and system products for computing  communications and consumer electronics applications 
as of december   our chip interface technologies are covered by more than us and foreign patents 
additionally  we have approximately patent applications pending 
these patents and patent applications cover important inventions in memory and logic chip interfaces  in addition to other technologies 
we believe that our chip interface technologies provide a higher performance  lower risk  and more cost effective alternative for our customers than can be achieved through their own internal research and development efforts 
we offer our customers two alternatives for using our chip interface technologies in their products first  we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and system companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
patent license agreements are royalty bearing 
second  we develop leadership which are rambus proprietary products widely licensed to our customers and industry standard chip interface products that we provide to our customers under license for incorporation into their semiconductor and system products 
because of the often complex nature of implementing state of the art chip interface technology  we offer our customers a range of engineering services to help them successfully integrate our chip interface products into their semiconductors and systems 
product license agreements may have both a fixed price non recurring component and ongoing royalties 
engineering services are customarily bundled with our product licenses  and are performed on a fixed price basis 
further  under product licenses  our customers may receive licenses to our patents necessary to implement the chip interface in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts with us 
we derive the majority of our annual revenues by licensing our broad portfolio of patents for chip interfaces to our customers 
such licenses may cover part or all of our patent portfolio 
leading semiconductor and system companies such as amd  elpida  fujitsu  qimonda  intel  matsushita  necel  renesas  spansion and toshiba have licensed our patents for use in their own products 
we derive additional revenues by licensing our leadership and industry standard chip interface products to our customers for use in their semiconductor and system products 
our customers include leading companies such as fujitsu  elpida  ibm  intel  matsushita  texas instruments  sony  st micro  qimonda and toshiba 
due to the complex nature of implementing our technologies  we provide engineering services under certain of these licenses 
table of contents to help successfully integrate our chip interface products into their semiconductors and systems 
additionally  product licensees may receive  as an adjunct to their chip interface license agreements  patent licenses as necessary to implement the chip interface in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
royalties represent a substantial portion of our total revenues 
the remaining part of our revenue is engineering services revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues or unbilled receivables in any given period 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration  with our top five licensees representing approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenues from fujitsu  elpida  qimonda and toshiba  each accounted for or more of total revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues from fujitsu  elpida  qimonda and intel  each accounted for or more of total revenues 
for the year ended december   revenue from intel  elpida  toshiba and matsushita  each accounted for or more of our total revenues 
our revenue from companies headquartered outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that we may continue to experience significant revenue concentration and have significant revenues from sources outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
historically  we have been involved in significant litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict and we anticipate future litigation expenses to continue to be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue would likely decline 
revenue concentration as indicated above  we have a high degree of revenue concentration 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we expect that our revenue concentration will decrease over time as we license new customers 
the royalties we receive are partly a function of the adoption of our chip interfaces by system companies 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our chip interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide us with details as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenues will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
there can be no assurance as to the unit volumes of licensed semiconductors that will be purchased by these companies in the future or as to the level of royalty bearing revenues that our licensees will receive from sales to these companies 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a significant number of other system companies will adopt our chip interfaces or that our dependence upon particular system companies will decrease in the future 
international revenues we expect that revenues derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
to date  all of the revenues from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency 
table of contents exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenues  see note  business segments  exports and major customers of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
expenses we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration including litigation expenses  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenues change 
engineering 
engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenues reflects the portion of the total engineering costs which are specifically devoted to individual licensee development and support services 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for the development of generally applicable chip interface technologies  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of the development and implementation schedules of individual licensee contracts 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  legal  finance  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and they can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consistent with our business model  sales and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to system companies 
in many cases  we must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period  these expenses generally do not correlate to the level of revenues in that period or in recent or future periods 
costs of restatement and related legal activities 
costs of restatement and related legal activities consist primarily of investigation  audit  legal and other professional fees related to the stock option investigation  the filing of the restated financial statements and related litigation 
taxes 
we report certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported for tax purposes 
we recognize revenue for financial reporting purposes as such amounts are earned and this could occur over several reporting periods 
as a result of the above and other differences between tax and financial reporting for income and expense recognition  our net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  we maintain reserves for uncertain tax positions under fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenues royalties contract revenues total revenues costs and expenses cost of contract revenues research and development marketing  general and administrative costs of restatement and related legal activities total costs and expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss includes stock based compensation cost of contract revenues research and development marketing  general and administrative years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions total revenues royalties contract revenues total revenues royalty revenues patent licenses in the years ended december   and  our largest source of royalties was related to the license of our patents for sdr and ddr compatible products 
royalties decreased approximately million for sdr and ddr compatible products in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue in from amd  qimonda and nec  partially offset by increased royalties from toshiba  fujitsu and spansion 
royalties increased approximately million for sdr and ddr compatible products in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to revenue from licensees signed in and the first quarter of  including fujitsu  amd and qimonda  partially offset by decreased royalties from samsung and matsushita 
as of december   we had both variable and fixed royalty agreements for our sdr and ddr compatible licenses 
on december   we entered into a five year patent license agreement with amd 
we are recognizing royalty revenues under the amd agreement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and 
table of contents payment is received because the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
we recognized royalty revenues of million and million in and  respectively  and we expect to recognize royalty revenues of million in through and million in under the amd agreement 
the amd agreement provides a license of our patented technology used in the design of ddr  ddr  fb dimm  pci express and xdr controllers as well as other current and future high speed memory and logic controller interfaces 
on march   we entered into a five year patent license agreement with fujitsu 
we expect to recognize royalty revenues under the fujitsu agreement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payment is received as the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
we recognized a total of million and million of royalty revenues in and  respectively 
the fujitsu agreement provides a license that covers semiconductors  components and systems  but does not include a license to fujitsu for its own manufacturing of commodity sdram other than limited amounts of sdr sdram annually 
on march   we entered into a settlement and license agreement with infineon and its former parent siemens  which was assigned to qimonda in october in connection with infineon s spin off of qimonda 
the settlement and license agreement  among other things  requires qimonda to pay to us aggregate royalties of million in quarterly installments of approximately million  which started on november  the settlement and license agreement further provides that if we enter into licenses with certain other dram manufacturers  qimonda will be required to make additional royalty payments to us that may aggregate up to million 
as we have not yet succeeded in entering into these additional license agreements necessary to trigger qimonda s obligations  qimonda s quarterly payment decreased to million in the fourth quarter of and has ceased in the first quarter of the quarterly payments with qimonda will not recommence until we enter into additional license agreements with certain other dram manufacturers 
we are in negotiations with new prospective licensees 
we expect sdr and ddr compatible royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
there was no royalty revenue recorded from the intel patent cross license in the year ended december   because the term of the agreement expired in june the intel patent cross license agreement represented the second largest source of royalties in the years ended december  and royalties under this agreement decreased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in on february   the federal trade commission the ftc issued an order requiring us to limit the royalty rates charged for certain sdr and ddr sdram memory and controller products sold after april  the ftc stayed this requirement on march   subject to certain conditions 
one such condition of the stay limits the royalties we can receive under certain contracts so that they do not exceed the ftc s maximum allowable royalties mar 
we are using our best efforts to comply with these orders 
amounts in excess of mar that are subject to the order are excluded from revenue 
as of december   million has been excluded from revenue 
depending on the final resolution of the appeal  we may or may not be able to recognize any excess amounts as additional revenue 
product licenses in the year ended december   royalties from xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products represented the second largest category of royalties 
royalties from these products increased approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in in the year ended december   royalties from rdram compatible products represented the third largest source of royalties 
royalties from rdram memory chips and controllers increased million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in 
table of contents in the years ended december  and  royalties from rdram compatible products represented the third largest source of royalties 
royalties from rdram memory chips and controllers decreased approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in royalties from xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products represent the fourth largest category of royalties 
royalties from xdr and serial link compatible products increased approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase of xdr and serial link compatible products for over is primarily due to increased volumes of xdr dram associated with shipments of the sony playstation product 
in the future  we expect royalties from xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products will continue to vary from period to period based on our licensees shipment volumes  sales prices  and product mix 
contract revenue percentage of completion contracts percentage of completion contract revenue increased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase is due to increased revenue from leadership and industry standard chip interface contracts 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   percentage of completion contract revenue decreased approximately million due to completion of leadership chip interface contracts during  including xdr and flexio 
we believe that percentage of completion contract revenues recognized will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contractual requirements  the amount of work performed  and by changes to work required  as well as new contracts booked in the future 
other contracts other contracts revenue decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to decreased revenue from industry standard chip interface contracts offset by increased revenue from leadership contracts 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  revenue which is recognized over the estimated service periods or on a completed contract basis increased approximately million due to increased revenue from industry standard and leadership chip interface contracts 
we believe that other contracts revenue will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contract requirements  the timing of completing engineering deliverables  as well as new contracts booked in the future 
engineering costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions engineering costs cost of contract revenues stock based compensation total cost of contract revenues research and development stock based compensation total research and development total engineering costs 
table of contents for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  engineering costs increased primarily due to expenses associated with tax reimbursement expenses of approximately million  increased compensation expenses of million associated with an increase in headcount  increased amortization expense of design software maintenance of million and increased information technology expenses of approximately million offset in part by a decrease in total stock based compensation expense of million 
the tax reimbursement expenses are associated with our decision to reimburse current employees for the internal revenue code section a penalty taxes imposed on them in connection with their exercise of repriced options in additionally  stock based compensation expenses include the effect of a change in our estimated forfeiture rates for awards outstanding 
in certain periods  the cost of contract revenues may exceed contract revenues that do not factor in the expected stream of future royalty payments 
this can be further impacted by expensing of pre contract costs  and completed contract costs where the realizability of an asset is uncertain  and low utilization of project resources 
during the quarter ended december   we recognized an expense of approximately million related to an estimated loss contract 
these expenditures were recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in cost of contract revenues during the fourth quarter of when such loss was determined 
additionally  cost of contract revenues exceeded contract revenues partially due to stock based compensation expense of million recognized during for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total engineering costs was primarily a result of increased stock based compensation approximately million associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r in  increased salary and benefit costs approximately million associated with an average increase of approximately employees  increased bonus expense approximately million due to higher achievement of bonus targets and an increased number of participants in the corporate bonus plan  increased information technology costs due to spending related to personnel  consulting and depreciation approximately million increased depreciation and intangible amortization expense approximately million higher payroll taxes approximately million associated with higher stock option exercises in the first half of and increased salary costs 
in the near term  we expect engineering expenses will continue to increase as we make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our leadership position in chip interface technologies and increase headcount 
marketing  general and administrative costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions marketing  general and administrative costs marketing  general and administrative costs litigation expense stock based compensation total marketing  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total marketing  general and administrative costs was primarily due to higher stock based compensation expense of million  professional and consulting fees of million  payroll costs associated with million of severance expense  approximately million of tax reimbursement expenses associated with internal revenue code section a and increased litigation expenses of million which includes an increase of general litigation expenses of million in  offset by a one time bonus of million paid to a law firm in 
the tax reimbursement expenses are associated with our decision to reimburse current and former non executive employees for the internal revenue code section a penalty taxes imposed on them in connection with their exercise of 
table of contents repriced options in additionally  stock based compensation expenses include the effect of a change in our estimated forfeiture rates for awards outstanding as well as the effect of performance based restricted stock units 
costs of restatement and related legal activities are discussed in the next section 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total marketing  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of increased stock based compensation costs approximately million associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r in  increased salary costs approximately million associated with an average increase of approximately employees in the us and internationally  increased bonus expense approximately million due to higher achievement of bonus targets and an increased number of participants in the corporate bonus plan  increased consulting costs approximately million  higher payroll taxes approximately million associated with payroll tax withholding liability for certain repriced stock grants that no longer qualify for incentive stock option tax treatment in the first half of and increased salary costs  increased depreciation and intangible amortization expense approximately million increased litigation expense approximately million and increased rent expense approximately million 
costs of restatement and related legal activities are discussed in the next section 
in the future  marketing  general and administrative expenses will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal  and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken  and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
litigation expenses are expected to continue to be at or above the expense levels due to the current high level of litigation activity 
costs of restatement and related legal activities years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions costs of restatement and related legal activities costs of restatement and related legal activities consist primarily of investigation  audit  legal and other professional fees related to the stock option investigation and the filing of the restated financial statements and related litigation 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in costs of restatement and related legal activities was primarily associated with the one time accrual of million in the third quarter of related to the potential settlement of the consolidated class action lawsuit pertaining to the accounting for stock option grants and related disclosures  offset in part by higher accounting and audit fees and consulting expenses of million in relating to the filing of our restated financial statements in late for the year ended december  we incurred approximately million in costs of restatement and related legal activities 
there were no comparable costs incurred for the year ended december  the costs consist primarily of settlement accruals  including the accrual of million in the third quarter of related to the potential settlement of the consolidated class action lawsuit pertaining to the accounting for stock option grants and related disclosures  plus investigation  audit  litigation and other professional fees 
the company expects to continue to incur restatement related litigation costs in the future arising from stock options investigation related claims 
interest and other income  net years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in interest and other income  net was primarily due to higher investment yields and higher average cash and 
table of contents investment balances 
in addition  the year ended included amortization of note issuance costs of million  including million that was accelerated into the fourth quarter of  in connection with the calling of the million in convertible notes 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in interest and other income  net consists primarily of gains on the repurchases of the outstanding convertible notes in  that were issued in the first quarter of approximately million  offset in part by higher interest income primarily due to higher cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates approximately million in year ended interest and other income  net also includes million of amortization of note issuance costs  including million that was accelerated into the fourth quarter of  in connection with the calling of the million in convertible notes see note convertible notes of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
in the future  we expect that interest and other income  net will vary from period to period based on the amount of cash and marketable securities and interest rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions provision for benefit from income taxes effective tax rate the tax rate is higher than the benefit calculated using the us statutory tax rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  stock based compensation expense associated with executives and state income taxes 
the tax rate is higher than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  partially offset by the lack of deductibility of certain stock based compensation expense associated with executives 
the tax rate is lower than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax benefit from stock based compensation expense associated with executives 
in the year ended december   our net deferred tax assets increased by million to million  primarily due to the net increase in future tax benefits related to employee stock related compensation  additional tax credits and net operating losses unrelated to stock option windfall benefits  offset by a decrease in future tax benefits related to depreciation and amortization 
additional information regarding our deferred tax asset is set forth below in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes and is incorporated herein by reference 
pursuant to footnote of sfas no 
r  tax attributes related to stock option windfall deductions should not be recorded until they result in a reduction of cash taxes payable 
starting in  we no longer include net operating losses attributable to stock option windfall deductions as components of our gross deferred tax assets 
the benefit of these net operating losses will be recorded to equity when they reduce cash taxes payable 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  in millions cash and cash equivalents marketable securities marketable securities  long term total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
table of contents years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities liquidity we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations 
we continue to generate positive operating cash flows 
we currently use cash generated from operations for capital expenditures and investments 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our current available sources of funds including cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  plus the anticipated cash generated from operations  will be adequate to finance our operations  capital expenditures and stock repurchases for at least the next year 
operating activities our positive cash flows from operating activities of million in the year ended december  were primarily attributable to a net loss of million adjusted for million of stock based compensation expense and million of depreciation and amortization expense  million in loss on disposal of property and equipment including approximately million in write off of leasehold improvements related to the closure of our previous india office  offset by cash outflows of million primarily from changes in our working capital  including the tax reimbursement expenses associated with our decision to reimburse current and former non executive employees for the internal revenue code section a penalty taxes imposed on them in connection with their exercise of repriced options in non cash working capital changes primarily relate to a deferred tax benefit of million  a million net decrease in deferred revenue and a million decrease in accrued salaries and benefits and other accrued liabilities  offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued litigation expenses and a million increase in income taxes payable 
cash generated by operating activities in the year ended december  was million primarily as a result of a net loss of million  adjusted for certain non cash items  including increases resulting from stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation of million  amortization of intangible assets of million  amortization of million of note issuance costs  including an additional million in connection with the notice of acceleration relating to the million of our convertible notes 
in addition  cash generated by operating activities was positively impacted by a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued salaries and benefits and other accrued liabilities  a million increase in accrued litigation expenses and a million increase in income taxes payable 
cash generated by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in deferred taxes of million  an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and a net increase in deferred revenue of million 
cash generated by operating activities was million in the year ended december   and was primarily the result of net income of million adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation of million  amortization of note issuance costs of million  amortization of intangible assets of million  stock based compensation of million  tax benefit of stock options of million  and loss on disposal of assets of million  offset by a million gain on repurchase of convertible notes 
operating activities were also affected by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a million increase in deferred tax provision  a million increase in accrued salaries and benefits and other accrued liabilities and a million increase in accrued litigation expenses  offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  a million decrease in accounts payable and a million decrease in income taxes payable 
this cash generated from operating activities was partially offset by a net decrease in deferred revenue of million resulting from 
table of contents contract revenues recognized in excess of contract billings primarily related to increased revenues for xdr and flexio chip interface contracts in which billings were made in the prior year 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities of approximately million in the year ended december  primarily consisted of proceeds from the maturities of available for sale marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of available for sale marketable securities of million  and additional consideration paid of million on the acquisition of gda 
additionally  we purchased million of primarily computer software and million of leasehold improvements 
cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december   and primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of million  offset by maturities of million 
in addition  million was used to acquire certain proprietary assets from gda  million was used to purchase intangible assets  million was used to acquire property and equipment  primarily computer and software and million was used to acquire leasehold improvements 
cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december   and primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of million resulting from the investment of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes  offset by maturities of million 
in addition  million was used to acquire certain proprietary digital core designs from gda  million was used to acquire certain serial link intellectual property assets from cadence and million was used for the purchase of property and equipment  including computer and software purchases in the united states and computer equipment  software  leasehold improvements and office equipment and furniture for a new facility in india 
the change is partially offset by a reduction in restricted cash of million due to the settlement in the infineon case  which removed the restrictions on these assets 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december  we received proceeds from the issuance of stock from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of million during the fourth quarter of the year and paid million under installment payment plans used to acquire software license agreements 
no other significant financing activities occurred during the year primarily due to the stock option investigation and restatement  during which we suspended our common stock repurchase program and suspended employee stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock associated with exercises of employee stock options and common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock of million 
in addition  we made a million installment payment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december  we received net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of million and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with exercises of employee stock options and common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
this cash provided from the issuance of convertible notes and common stock was partially offset by the repurchase of our common stock of million and the repurchases of outstanding convertible notes of million 
in addition  we repaid approximately million against an installment payment plan totalling million used to acquire capitalized software 
we currently anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows from our operating activities will be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next months 
additionally  we have begun repurchasing additional shares in under our share repurchase program which will adversely impact our cash balances 
as described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and this report  we are involved in ongoing litigation related to our intellectual property and 
table of contents our past stock option investigation 
any adverse settlements or judgments in this litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash balances and cash flows in the period in which such events occur 
contractual obligations we lease our present office facilities in los altos  california  under an operating lease agreement through december  as part of this lease transaction  we provided a letter of credit restricting  of our cash as collateral for certain obligations under the lease 
the cash is restricted as to withdrawal and is managed by a third party subject to certain limitations under our investment policy 
we also lease a facility in mountain view  california  through november   a facility in chapel hill  north carolina through november  and a facility for our design center in bangalore  india through november  we also lease office facilities in austin  texas and various international locations under non cancelable leases that range in terms from month to month to one year 
in may  we signed an agreement to lease a new office facility in bangalore  india into which we have consolidated all of our bangalore operations as of december  as discussed more fully in note  convertible notes of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have million zero coupon convertible senior notes the convertible notes outstanding at december  in connection with certain german litigation  the german courts have requested that we set aside adequate funds to cover potential court cost claims 
accordingly  approximately million is restricted as to withdrawal  managed by a third party subject to certain limitations under our investment policy and included in restricted cash to cover the german court requirements 
as of december   our material contractual obligations are payment due by year total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating leases convertible notes purchased software license agreements total the above table does not reflect possible payments in connection with uncertain tax benefits associated with fin of approximately million as of december  as noted in note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  although it is possible that some of the unrecognized tax benefits could be settled within the next months  we cannot reasonably estimate the outcome at this time 
we have commitments with various software vendors for non cancellable license agreements that generally have terms longer than one year 
the above table summarizes those contractual obligations as of december   which are also included on our consolidated balance sheets under current and other long term liabilities 
contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options warrants in october  our board of directors authorized an incentive program in the form of warrants for a total of up to  shares of our common stock to be issued to various rdram licensees 
the warrants  which were issued at the time certain targets were met  had an exercise price of per share and a life of five years from the date of issuance 
these warrants were to vest and become exercisable only upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rdram chipsets 
warrants exercisable for a total of 
table of contents  shares of our common stock had been issued under the program 
as of december   no warrants were exercised as the defined milestones were not achieved  and all warrants have now expired 
contingent unvested options as of december   there were  contingent unvested options  which vest upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rdram e chipsets 
intel has since phased out the e chipset and as a result the unvested options will never vest 
these contingent unvested options were granted in and with a term of years 
as of december    contingent unvested options were forfeited 
as of december   there were  contingent unvested options 
as noted above  none are expected to vest 
share repurchase program in october  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of our common stock  principally to reduce the dilutive effect of employee stock options

rambus and the other defendants have filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint and a hearing on these motions is scheduled for march  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition overview our revenue recognition policy is based on the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop and sop for certain of our revenue contracts  revenue is recognized according to sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in application of the specific authoritative literature cited above  we comply with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting concepts no 
and we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
determination of whether or not these criteria have been met may require us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates based upon current information and historical experience 
our revenues consist of royalty revenues and contract revenues generated from agreements with semiconductor companies  system companies and certain reseller arrangements 
royalty revenues consist of patent license royalties and product license royalties 
contract revenues consist of fixed license fees  fixed engineering fees and service fees associated with integration of our chip interface products into our customers products 
contract revenues may also include support or maintenance 
reseller arrangements generally provide for the pass through of a percentage of the fees paid to the reseller by its customer for use of our patent and product licenses 
we do not recognize revenue for these arrangements until we have received notice of revenue earned by and paid to the reseller  accompanied by the pass through payment from the reseller 
we do not pay commissions to the reseller for these arrangements 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
in such arrangements  revenue is only recognized to the extent that is consistent with the cancellation provisions 
cancellation provisions within such contracts generally provide for a prospective cancellation with no refund of fees already remitted by customers for products provided and payment for services rendered prior to the date of cancellation 
unbilled receivables represent enforceable claims and are deemed collectible in connection with our revenue recognition policy 
royalty revenues we recognize royalty revenues upon notification by our licensees and when payments are received 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally either require licensees to give us notification and to pay the royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur or are based on a fixed royalty that is due within days of the end of the quarter 
from time to time  we engage accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to perform  on our behalf  periodic audits of some of the licensee s reports of royalties to us and any adjustment resulting from such royalty audits is recorded in the period such adjustment is determined 
we have two types of royalty revenues patent license royalties and product license royalties 
patent licenses 
we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and systems companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
we generally recognize revenue from these arrangements as amounts become due and payment is received 
the contractual terms of the agreements generally provide for payments over an extended period of time 
product licenses 
we develop proprietary and industry standard chip interface products  such as rdram and xdr that we provide to our customers under product license agreements 
these arrangements include royalties  which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold 
we recognize revenue from these arrangements upon notification from the licensee and when payments are received 
on february   the federal trade commission the ftc issued an order requiring us to limit the royalty rates charged for certain sdr and ddr sdram memory and controller products sold after april  the ftc stayed this requirement on march   subject to certain conditions 
one such condition of the stay limits the royalties we can receive under certain contracts so that they do not exceed the ftc s maximum allowable 
table of contents royalties mar 
we are using our best efforts to comply with these orders 
amounts in excess of mar that are subject to the order are excluded from revenue 
to date  such amounts have not been significant 
depending on the final resolution of the appeal  we may or may not be able to recognize any excess amounts as additional revenue 
contract revenues we generally recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sop for development contracts related to licenses of our chip interface products  such as xdr and flexio that involve significant engineering and integration services 
revenues derived from such license and engineering services may be recognized using the completed contract or percentage of completion method 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based upon labor hours incurred 
we have evaluated use of output measures versus input measures and have determined that our output is not sufficiently uniform with respect to cost  time and effort per unit of output to use output measures as a measure of progress to completion 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees may be due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the work required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total amount of work necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the newly estimated total amount of work necessary to complete a project was longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees will be recognized over a longer period 
if there is significant uncertainty about the time to complete  or the deliverables by either party  we evaluate the appropriateness of applying the completed contract method of accounting under sop such evaluation is completed by us on a contract by contract basis 
for all contracts where revenue recognition must be delayed until the contract deliverables are substantially complete  we evaluate the realizability of the assets which the accumulated costs would represent and defer or expense as incurred based upon the conclusions of our realization analysis 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we will recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues or unbilled receivables in any given period 
we also recognize revenue in accordance with sop  sop and sop for development contracts related to licenses of our chip interface products that involve non essential engineering services and post contract support pcs 
these sops apply to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the products and services provided under these arrangements are comprised of license fees and engineering service fees which are not essential to the functionality of the product 
our rates for pcs and for engineering services are specific to each development contract and not standardized in terms of rates or length 
because of these characteristics  we do not have a sufficient population of contracts from which to derive vendor specific objective evidence 
therefore  as required by sop  after we deliver the product  if the only undelivered element is pcs  we will recognize revenue ratably over either the contractual pcs period or the period during which pcs is expected to be provided 
we review assumptions regarding the pcs periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue to be recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  if the new estimated periods were shorter than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a shorter period 
conversely  if the new estimated periods were longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a longer period 

table of contents litigation we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note  litigation and asserted claims of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
based upon consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we accrue for losses related to litigation if we determine that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if a specific loss amount cannot be estimated  we review the range of possible outcomes and accrue the low end of the range of estimates 
any such accrual would be charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
this process requires us to calculate various items including permanent and temporary differences between the financial accounting and tax treatment of certain income and expense items  differences between federal and state tax treatment of these items  the amount of taxable income reported to various states  foreign taxes and tax credits 
the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes results in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the adoption of fin on january   our unrecognized tax benefits decreased by million  of which million was accounted for as a decrease to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and million was accounted for as an increase in additional paid in capital 
in addition  million of unrecognized tax benefits were reclassified from long term deferred tax assets to long term taxes payable 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
tax laws and regulations are at times ambiguous  and interpretations of and guidance regarding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
this requires us to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposure 
changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect our consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows 
at december   our consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax assets of approximately million  consisting of a combination of us and us tax benefits for a items which have been recognized for financial reporting purposes  but which will be deducted on tax returns to be filed in the future  and b loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of temporary book tax differences  estimates of projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
although realization is not assured  based on our assessment  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
of the million of deferred tax assets at december   approximately million relate to net operating loss carryforwards that start expiring in  and approximately million relate to tax credit carryforwards  of which million will start expiring in and the remaining will start expiring in the remaining net deferred tax assets comprise the following deductible temporary differences deferred revenue of million  which are expected to reverse in the next year 
depreciation and amortization of million  which are expected to reverse over the next years 
other liabilities and reserves of million  which are expected to reverse over the next years stock based compensation of million  which are expected to reverse over the next years 
we expect to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets from future earnings 
therefore  the realization of our net deferred tax assets is solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods before the expiration of our tax attributes 
the minimum amount of domestic future taxable income that would have to be generated to realize our deferred tax assets is approximately million 
our forecast of 
table of contents domestic income indicates it is more likely than not that the future results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
this forecast is highly influenced by  among other factors  assumptions regarding our ability to achieve our forecasted revenues  our ability to effectively manage our expenses in line with our forecasted revenues  the impact of intellectual property and other litigation  and general trends in the semiconductor industry worldwide 
our forecast of income is based on assumptions about current trends in our operations and future litigation outcomes or expected settlements  and there can be no assurance that such results will be achieved 
we review such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends quarterly for purpose of our realizability assessment 
as a result of this review  if we determine that we have insufficient future taxable income to fully realize our net deferred tax assets  we will record a valuation allowance by a charge to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards and our employee stock purchase plan using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock based compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 fasb technical bulletin ftb no 
 accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
in accordance with apb no 
 a non cash  stock based compensation expense was recognized for any options for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date and for any grants that were modified from their original terms 
the charge for the options with an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date was equal to the number of options multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date 
that expense was amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the charge for modifications of options in general was equal to the number of options modified multiplied by the difference between the market price of the options on the modification date and the grant price 
the charge for modified options was taken over the remaining service period  if any 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards 
we selected the modified prospective method of adoption which recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of all stock based payments granted after january  and for the fair value of all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on the date of adoption 
we use the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option and employee stock purchase plan espp awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the bsm option pricing model requires the estimation of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include expected volatility  expected life of the award  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of our common stock 
we use implied volatility for both our stock options and espp shares based on freely traded options in the open market  as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical or blended volatility 
if there is not sufficient volume in our market traded options for any period  we will use an equally weighted blend of historical and implied volatility 
the expected term assumption for our stock option grants was determined using a monte carlo simulation model which projects future option holder behavior patterns based upon actual historical option exercises 
sfas no 
r also requires the application of a forfeiture rate to the calculated fair value of stock options on a prospective basis 
our assumption of forfeiture rate represents the historical rate at which our stock based awards were surrendered prior to vesting over the trailing four years 
if our assumption of forfeiture rate changes  we would have to make a cumulative adjustment in the current period 
we monitor the assumptions used to compute the fair value of our stock options and espp awards on a regular basis and we will revise our assumptions as appropriate 
in the event that assumptions used to compute the fair value of these awards are later determined to be inaccurate or if we change our assumptions significantly in future periods  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio 
interest rate fluctuation may arise from changes in the market s view of the quality of the security issuer  the overall economic outlook  and the time to maturity of our portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by investing only in high quality  highly liquid instruments 
securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three industry standard rating agencies as follows a by standard poor s  p by moody s and or f by fitch 
securities with original maturities of greater than one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows aa by standard poor s  aa by moody s and or aa by fitch 
by corporate policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure to million for any one commercial issuer 
our policy requires that at least of the portfolio be in securities with a maturity of days or less 
in addition  we may make investments in securities with maturities up to months 
however  the bias of our investment policy is toward shorter maturities 
we invest our cash equivalents and short term marketable securities in a variety of us dollar financial instruments such as treasuries  government agencies  repurchase agreements  commercial paper and bankers acceptance 
our policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purposes of realizing trading profits 
however  we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if we experience unforeseen liquidity requirements 
in such a case if the environment has been one of rising interest rates we may experience a realized loss  similarly  if the environment has been one of declining interest rates we may experience a realized gain 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable securities of million excluding cash and cash equivalents 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels as of december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
actual results may differ materially from this sensitivity analysis 
we bill our customers in us dollars 
although the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may impact our customers  and thus indirectly impact us  we do not attempt to hedge this indirect and speculative risk 
our overseas operations consist primarily of business development offices of from to people in any one country and one design center in india 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure  however  as of december   we believe our foreign currency exposure is not material enough to warrant foreign currency hedging
