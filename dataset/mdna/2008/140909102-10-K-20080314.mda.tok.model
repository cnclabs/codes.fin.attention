item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a major manufacturer of recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products 
we operate in four business segments 
the paperboard segment manufactures recycled uncoated and clay coated paperboard and operates a specialty converting operation 
the recovered fiber segment collects and sells recycled paper and brokers recycled paper and other paper rolls 
the tube and core segment produces spiral and convolute wound tubes and cores 
the folding carton segment produces printed and unprinted folding cartons and set up boxes 
our business is vertically integrated to a large extent 
this means that our converting operations consume a large portion of our own paperboard production  approximately in the remaining of our paperboard production is sold to external customers in any of the four recycled paperboard end use markets tube and core  folding cartons  gypsum wallboard facing paper  and specialty paperboard products 
these integration statistics do not include volume produced or converted by our owned  unconsolidated joint venture premier boxboard 
as part of our strategy to optimize our operating efficiency  each of our mills can produce recycled paperboard for more than one end use market 
this allows us to shift production among mills in response to customer or market demands 
more recently  in light of the difficult operating climate we have faced  and in an effort to reduce costs and improve our business mix  capacity deployment and profitability  restructuring activities have become an important element of our strategy 
the previous sales of our interest in standard gypsum  our corrugated box plant and partition businesses  our two coated recycled paperboard mills and our specialty packaging businesses  as well as the recent sale of our composite container and plastics businesses  are all part of our strategic transformation plan to reduce our debt and better position ourselves to compete and leverage our expertise in our core businesses 
we are a holding company that operates our business through subsidiaries as of the date of this filing 
we also own a interest in a joint venture with temple inland 
we have one additional joint venture with an unrelated entity in which our investment and share of earnings are immaterial 
we had an additional joint venture during  which interest we sold 
our investment and share of earnings in that joint venture were immaterial 
we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
see liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings below 
our results of operations described below reflect the results for our continuing operations and the results for the various periods described have been adjusted to eliminate the results of discontinued operations 
key business indicator and trends historically  demand in our industry has been closely correlated with the domestic economy in general  and with consumer nondurable consumption packaging segment and industrial production tube and core segment  specifically 
demand tends to be cyclical in nature  with cycles lasting three to five years depending on gross domestic product  interest rates and other factors 
as these demand drivers fluctuate  we typically experience variability in volume  revenue and profitability in our business 
from late through  the recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products industry was in a down cycle 
since our industry has improved but has not returned to historical levels of demand and capacity utilization 
while we believe that future operating results may improve  we cannot ascertain when or to what extent this may occur 
the key operating indicator of our business is paperboard mill operating rates 
mill operating rates are calculated as the ratio of production compared with capacity  assuming a normalized mill schedule of days per year 
as paperboard mill operating rates increase  cost per ton of paperboard generally decreases 
as these tons are sold  profitability increases since fixed production costs are absorbed by more tons produced 
additionally  higher operating rates generally provide enhanced opportunity to recover material and labor increases through improved pricing 
this positively affects paperboard and converted products income from operations and cash flow 

table of contents paperboard mill operating rates are affected by demand and by mill closures 
industry demand decreased from to due primarily to a recessionary general economy  the continued migration of us manufacturing offshore to find lower labor cost and product substitution such as the replacement of paperboard carton packaging with plastic standup pouches 
the decrease in demand resulted in a decrease in operating rates for us and the industry as a whole 
we expect the migration of us manufacturing offshore and product substitution to continue  which could continue to negatively affect operating results 
logo industry source american forest and paper association 
restructuring has been a primary component of management s strategy to address the decrease in demand resulting from secular trends  as discussed above  and generally weak domestic economic conditions 
between and  restructuring and impairment costs have totaled million  of which approximately million have been noncash charges 
see results of operations and results of operations we have also experienced increases in near term manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs as a result of our transitioning of business within our mill and converting systems to other company facilities 
our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our competitiveness through reduced costs  increase revenue through delivery of differentiated quality products and services to our customers  and promote compliance with recent changes in legal and regulatory requirements 
our restructuring efforts have been directed toward reducing costs through manufacturing and converting facilities rationalization where we believed it was advantageous to do so due to geographic overlap  duplicative capabilities  changes in customer base and other factors 
rationalization of facilities typically results in increased cash outlays and expenses initially  for example  severance costs 
restructuring charges decreased by in versus  and we believe that future earnings and cash flows will be favorably impacted by our continued efforts to reconfigure our business to increase efficiency and better match supply with customer demand 
recovered fiber  which is derived from recycled paper stock  is our most significant raw material 
historically  the cost of recovered fiber has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
for example  our average recovered fiber cost per ton of paperboard produced increased from per ton in to per ton in  an increase of  before dropping to per ton in recovered fiber cost per ton averaged approximately and during and  respectively 
excluding raw materials and labor  energy is our most significant manufacturing cost 
energy consists of fuel used to generate steam used in the paper making process and electrical purchases to operate our paperboard machines and all of our converting machinery 
in  the average energy cost in our mill system was approximately per ton compared to per ton in  a increase 
in energy costs averaged per ton  a decrease of from until the last several years  our business had not been significantly affected by fluctuating energy costs  and we historically have not passed increases in energy costs through to our customers 
as the volatility of energy prices has increased dramatically over the last three years  we have not been able to pass through to our customers all of the energy cost increases we have incurred 
as a result  our operating margins have been adversely affected 
although we continue to evaluate our energy costs and consider ways to factor energy costs into our pricing  we cannot give assurance that our operating margins and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
see part i  item  risk factors our operating margins may be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
we raise our selling prices in response to increases in raw material and energy costs 
however  we often are unable to pass the full amount of these costs through to our customers on a timely basis due to supply and demand in the industry  and as a 
table of contents result often cannot maintain our operating margins in the face of dramatic cost increases 
we experience margin shrinkage during all periods of cost increases due to customary time lags in implementing our price increases 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to recover any future increases in the cost of recovered fiber by raising the prices of our products 
even if we are able to recover future cost increases  our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases 
see part i  item a  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by future increases in raw material and other operating costs 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves forming estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial conditions and results of operations to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
changes in these estimates are recorded periodically based on updated information 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue and the related account receivable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
generally  we recognize revenue when we ship our manufactured products or when we complete a service and title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
provisions for discounts  returns  allowances  customer rebates and other adjustments which have averaged less than of sales for the years ended december   and are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are determined based on historical experience or specific customer arrangements 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
when we become aware of a customer whose financial viability is questionable  we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for future shipments 
if a customer enters a bankruptcy action  we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for noncollectibility is warranted 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and our provision for uncollectible accounts was thousand  million and million for the years ending  and  respectively 
the increase in our provision during was primarily the result of a customer bankruptcy 
the low provision during primarily resulted from recoveries of previously reserved accounts 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes raw material recovered fiber for paperboard products and paperboard for converted products  direct and indirect labor and employee benefits  energy and fuel  depreciation  chemicals  general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management reviews inventory at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write offs for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
inventory over six months old is generally deemed unsaleable at first quality prices unless customer arrangements or other special circumstances exist 
we reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on management s judgment of future realization 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the write offs required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory  however  in  and  these write offs  other than those related to specific customer bankruptcies  were insignificant 
goodwill 
we test the carrying amount of goodwill at least annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
impairment 
table of contents testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes  growth rates of selling prices and costs  changes in working capital  investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we also test the sensitivities of fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes  selling prices and costs 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible impairment is indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit attributed to those net assets 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 
we also use judgment in assessing whether we should test more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition  product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
in december  we recognized certain impairment indicators related to our decision  at that time  to exit the coated recycled paperboard business 
as a result  we retested our goodwill as of december  and recorded impairment charges of approximately million in our paperboard segment and million in our folding carton segment 
the goodwill impairment recorded in our folding carton segment resulted from the expected loss of synergies that existed between the coated recycled paperboard business and the folding carton segment resulting from the proposed disposition of the coated recycled paperboard business at that time 
additionally  in we wrote off approximately million of goodwill related to the divestiture of our composite container and plastics businesses 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment test was performed in december and did not result in any additional goodwill impairment 
we believe that our remaining goodwill balance of million as of december  is not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in conditions may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could initiate an impairment review include the following significant operating losses recurring operating losses significant declines in demand for a product produced by an asset capable of producing only that product assets that are idled or held for sale assets that are likely to be divested 
the impairment review requires management to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets and sum the estimated future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  then we must estimate the fair value of the asset 
if the fair value of the asset is below the carrying value  then the difference will be recognized as an impairment by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and results of operations 
impairment charges of million  million and million related to property  plant and equipment were recorded in  and  respectively 
of these amounts million  thousand and million were recorded in discontinued operations during  and  respectively 
during and  respectively  approximately million and million of the impairments were related to the disposition of the sprague  connecticut and rittman  ohio coated paperboard mills 
the assets impaired include real estate and machinery and equipment related to operations that permanently closed in conjunction with our restructuring activities  discontinued businesses and routine asset disposals 
the charges represent the difference between the carrying value of the assets and the estimated fair value 
fair value for assets held for sale as of december  were estimated based on considerations of preliminary indication of values from potential buyers  supported by industry multiples of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  discounted cash flows  and broker s opinions of value for real estate 
real estate held for sale as of december  of million is recorded as a component of other current assets 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health care costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
our self insured workers compensation liability is estimated based on actual claims as established by a third party administrator  increased by factors that reflect our historical claim development 
the developed claim  net of amounts paid 
table of contents and discounted to present value  represents the liability that we record in our financial statements 
the primary controllable driver of our workers compensation liability is the loss development factor that estimates the amount to which one dollar in actual claims incurred will ultimately grow over the life of the claim  which may be several years 
a increase in the loss development factors utilized for would have resulted in a thousand increase in workers compensation expense and accrued liability at december  our self insured health care liability is estimated based on our actual claim experience and multiplied by a time lag factor of days 
the lag factor represents an estimate of the number of days based on historical experience that claims have been incurred but not yet reported and  therefore  should be recorded as a liability 
a increase in the lag factor would have resulted in a thousand increase in our healthcare costs and accrued liability at december  future actual costs related to self insured coverage will depend on claims incurred  medical cost trends which have increased in recent years  safety performance  and various other factors related to our employee population  which has decreased in recent years 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and state tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our statement of operations and our balance sheet 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin no 
was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as a result of implementing fin no 
 the company recognized a net increase of million in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  retained earnings balance 
at december  and  we had net federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating losses of million and million  respectively 
at december  and we established valuation allowances of million and million for a portion of these deferred tax assets  respectively 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
the pension plan provides benefits to be paid to all eligible employees at retirement based primarily on years of service with the company and compensation rates in effect near retirement 
our policy is to fund benefits attributed to employees services to date as well as service expected to be earned in the future 
we contributed approximately million   and million during   and  respectively 
based on our current estimate of future funding requirements  we expect to make contributions of approximately million during in september  we announced the suspension of any further pension benefits for certain employees covered by the pension plan 
the suspension was effective as of december  and froze the accrued pension benefits for all employees other than those subject to a collective bargaining agreement and employees who do not qualify for continued benefits based on years of service and age requirements 
the curtailment reduced our december  projected benefit obligation by million and increased pension expense by thousand 
certain executives participate in a supplemental executive retirement plan serp  which provides retirement benefits to participants based on average compensation 
the serp was unfunded at december  
table of contents the determination of our pension plan and serp benefit obligations and expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the weighted average discount rate  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets and the weighted average rate of compensation increase 
the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions we used to determine our pension plan and serp projected benefit obligations as of serp pension plan weighted average discount rate weighted average rate of compensation increase the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions to determine net periodic pension expense for the years ended serp pension plan weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets n a n a n a weighted average rate of compensation increase in developing the weighted average discount rate  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including estimated timing of obligation payments and yields for long term bonds that received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate  determined on this basis  was and at december  and  respectively 
based on analysis of the rating and maturity of the long term bonds  the timing of payment obligations and the input from our actuaries  we concluded that a discount rate of is appropriate and reflects the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds that has the same duration as the plan obligations 
future actual pension expense and benefit obligations will depend on future investment performance  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to populations participating in our pension plans 
a change in the discount rate would result in a change in the december  projected benefit obligation of approximately million and estimated net pension expense of approximately thousand 
in developing our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets  we evaluated such criteria as return expectations by asset class and long term inflation assumptions 
our expected weighted average rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of approximately equity  fixed income and investment in a portfolio of hedge funds 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
as of december  and  we used expected weighted average rates of return of and  respectively 
a change in the weighted average expected rate of return would change estimated net pension expense approximately thousand 
in the year ending december   we made contributions of approximately million 
no contribution was required or made in the year ending december  we expect to make contributions of approximately million during primarily as a result of our contributions of approximately million  the under funded status of our pension plan and the serp decreased by approximately million in while we believe that the assumptions we have used are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension plan and serp liability 
we also provide postretirement medical benefits at certain of our subsidiaries 
our net periodic postretirement benefit cost for medical costs was approximately thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at december  and were determined using a weighted average discount rate of and  respectively 
the rate of increase in the costs of covered health care benefits is assumed to be in  decreasing to by the year increasing or decreasing the assumed health care costs trend rate by one percentage point would have increased or decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately thousand and thousand  respectively and this would have increased or decreased net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately thousand and thousand  respectively  for the year ended december  depreciation 
management is required to make estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of long lived assets 
these estimates can significantly affect depreciation expense and accordingly  both results of operations and the asset values reflected on the balance sheet

table of contents paperboard segment sales for the paperboard segment decreased due to lower volume which accounted for million of the decrease 
approximately million of the volume decrease was due to the disposition of our rittman and sprague coated paperboard mills 
this decrease was partially offset by higher selling prices in our uncoated paperboard operations which accounted for an estimated increase of million in sales 
recovered fiber segment sales for the recovered fiber segment increased primarily due to higher selling prices which accounted for an increase of approximately million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in volume which accounted for a decrease of approximately million 
tube and core segment sales for the tube and core segment decreased primarily due to lower volume which accounted for a decrease of million 
this decrease was partially offset by higher tube and core selling prices which accounted for an estimated increase of million in sales 
folding carton sales for the folding carton segment decreased primarily due to lower volume of approximately million resulting from closing and consolidating certain operations and evaluation and refinement of the customer portfolio and book of business 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the following factors lower direct material  labor  freight  and other manufacturing costs of approximately million in the paperboard segment related to the disposition of the rittman and sprague coated paperboard operations 
lower direct material  labor  repairs and maintenance  freight and other manufacturing costs of approximately million in the tube and core segment primarily due to lower volume related to facility closures 
lower labor costs in the paperboard segment of approximately million

lower repairs and maintenance and energy costs of million in the paperboard segment 
lower depreciation expense of approximately million in the paperboard  folding carton  and tube and core segments primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation related to the disposition or closure of facilities 
these factors were partially offset by the following increased expenses higher direct material costs of approximately million in the recovered fiber segment 
higher direct material costs in the paperboard segment of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   decreased by to million from million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the following factors elimination of approximately million of selling  general and administrative expenses in the paperboard segment related to the disposition of facilities 
elimination of approximately million of selling  general and administrative expenses in the folding carton segment related primarily to facility closures 
elimination of approximately million of selling  general and administrative expenses in the tube and core segment related primarily to the disposition of facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses in included a million reserve established for the settlement of a patent infringement dispute 
these improvements were partially offset by the following factor higher bad debt expense of million

net income loss 
due to the factors discussed above  net income for the year ended december  was million  or net income per common share  compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per common share  for the same period in liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources and risks 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility  described below 
downturns in operations can significantly affect our ability to generate cash 
factors that can affect our operating results and liquidity are discussed further in this annual report under risk factors in part i  item a 
at december  we had million of cash on hand and million borrowing availability under our senior credit facility 
we believe that our cash on hand together with our borrowing availability under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next months 
we are attempting to refinance our million outstanding senior notes which mature in june we are evaluating various refinancing alternatives 
if we are unable to generate cash at projected levels  our ability to generate cash sufficient to meet our long term requirements may be uncertain 
some of the factors that could affect our future ability to generate cash from operations are as follows continued volatility in the debt markets 
a contraction in domestic demand for recycled paperboard and related packaging products similar to what our industry experienced in  and 
table of contents increased market acceptance of alternative products  such as flexible packaging and plastics that have replaced or can replace certain of our packaging products 
continued export of domestic industrial manufacturing operations 
potential increases in fuel and energy costs 
potential increases in the cost of recovered fiber 
market acceptance of price increases and energy surcharges in response to rising operating costs 
significant unforeseen adverse conditions in our industry or the markets we serve 
the occurrence  continuation or exacerbation of these conditions could require us to seek additional funds from external sources in order to meet our liquidity requirements 
in such event  our ability to obtain additional funds would depend on the various business and credit market conditions prevailing at the time  which are difficult to predict and many of which are out of our control 
our ability to secure additional funds could also be materially adversely affected by our substantial indebtedness 
additional risks related to our substantial indebtedness are discussed in part i  item a of this annual report under risk factors our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness 
the availability of liquidity from our senior credit facility is primarily affected by our collateral base and our continued compliance with the terms of the senior credit facility  including the payment of interest and compliance with various covenants 
on may   the company purchased additional units in our paperlink  llc unconsolidated affiliate  for approximately  which increased our membership interest to greater than fifty percent 
we failed to timely pledge the assets of paperlink as a co borrower or guarantor of our debt which debt includes our senior credit facility and senior notes 
we subsequently determined that this failure was a technical violation of the debt covenants of both our senior credit facility and our senior notes  which require within a specified time period that we pledge the assets of any affiliate in which our membership interest exceeds fifty percent 
upon determination  we decreased our membership interest in paperlink to forty nine percent 
we notified the administrative agent for our senior credit facility and the trustee which administers our senior notes of the technical and inadvertent violation 
on june   the bank group that holds our senior credit facility consented to and waived any defaults regarding our violation 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility as of december  absent a deterioration of the us economy as a whole or the specific sectors on which our business depends see part i  item a  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in industrial production  housing and construction and the consumption of nondurable and durable goods  we believe we will be in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement for the next months 
borrowings 
at december  and december   total debt consisting of current maturities of debt and long term debt  as reported on our condensed consolidated balance sheets was as follows in thousands december  december  senior credit facility revolver senior credit facility term loan senior notes senior notes other notes payable realized interest rate swap gains total debt consists of realized interest rate swap gains less the original issuance discounts and accumulated discount amortization related to the senior and senior subordinated notes 
on march   we amended our senior credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement 
the agreement provides for a million senior secured credit facility consisting of a million five year revolver and a million five year term loan 
the five year revolver was reduced from million to million in october on may   we amended our senior credit facility which impacted the calculation of the availability under the senior credit facility and changed the applicable margins in the pricing grid which is discussed in more detail below 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries other than real property  including accounts receivable  general intangibles  inventory  and equipment 
these subsidiaries are parties to the senior credit facility either as co borrowers with us or as guarantors 
at december   we had million outstanding under the five year term loan and million outstanding under the revolver 

table of contents the revolver matures on march  and includes a sublimit of million for letters of credit 
borrowing availability under the revolver is determined by reference to a borrowing base  defined as specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and reduced by usage of the revolver  including outstanding letters of credit  and any reserves 
aggregate availability under the revolver was million at december  the term loan was drawn in full at closing and is required to be repaid in monthly installments based on a level six year amortization schedule  with all remaining outstanding principal due on march  outstanding principal of the term loan initially bears interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either the base rate which is the prime rate most recently announced by bank of america  na  the administrative agent under the senior credit facility plus  or the adjusted one  two  three  or six month libor rate plus 
outstanding principal under the revolver initially bears interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either the base rate plus 
or the adjusted one  two  three  or six month libor rate plus 
pricing under the senior credit facility is determined by reference to a pricing grid under which margins shall be adjusted prospectively on a quarterly basis as determined by the average availability and fixed charge coverage ratio measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  commencing with the fiscal quarter ended june  under the pricing grid  the applicable margins for the term loan range from to for base rate loans and from to for libor loans  and the applicable margins for the revolver range from to for base rate loans and from to for libor loans 
the undrawn portion of the revolver is subject to an unused line fee calculated at an annual rate of 
outstanding letters of credit are subject to an annual fee equal to the applicable margin for libor loans under the revolver as in effect from time to time  plus a fronting fee on the undrawn amount thereof at an annual rate of 
the actual rates in effect at december  were and for outstanding revolver and term loan borrowings  respectively 
the senior credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability and our subsidiaries ability to create liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  incur indebtedness and guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  or change the nature of our business 
the senior credit facility contains no financial maintenance covenants at this time  however  we must maintain a million minimum availability reserve at all times 
the availability disclosed is net of this reserve 
there is a one time option to convert to a springing covenant financial structure where the million minimum availability reserve would be eliminated  however  a fixed charge ratio would be tested in the event borrowing availability falls below million 
currently  we would not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio and  therefore  do not anticipate exercising this option 
the senior credit facility contains events of default including  but not limited to  nonpayment of principal or interest  violation of covenants  breaches of representations and warranties  cross default to other indebtedness  bankruptcy and other insolvency events  material judgments  certain events with respect to the employee retirement income security act of erisa  actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation  and certain changes of control of the company 
on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june  the senior notes were issued at a discount to yield an effective interest rate of and pay interest semiannually 
after taking into account realized gains from unwinding various interest rate swap agreements  the current effective interest rate of the senior notes is 
the senior notes are unsecured obligations 
as of december   we have purchased an aggregate of million of these notes in the open market 
on march   we issued million of senior subordinated notes due april  and million of senior notes due may  these senior subordinated notes and senior notes were issued at a discount to yield effective interest rates of and  respectively 
the publicly traded senior subordinated notes were  and the senior notes are  unsecured but guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all but one of the company s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
during and  we purchased million and million  respectively  of senior subordinated and senior notes in the open market 
on may   we redeemed our outstanding senior subordinated notes in full at a price of for each of outstanding principal amount of the notes plus million of accrued and unpaid interest from april  to may  at the time of redemption  the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes was million  and the total redemption price including accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premium was million 
we used proceeds from borrowings at closing under the senior credit facility  together with available cash  to fund the redemption 
the redemption resulted in a million loss  which was recognized in may of we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as long term debt and lease agreements 
see contractual obligations below and the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which detail these future obligations and commitments 

table of contents interest rate swap agreements 
historically  we have used interest rate swaps to effectively convert our fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate obligations 
this strategy has been employed in order to effect an optimal balance between fixed rate and variable rate obligations since  historically  variable rate debt obligations are lower cost than fixed rate debt 
during and we entered into several interest rates swaps and then unwound those swaps opportunistically for a gain 
these gains provided cash to us upon unwinding and lowered our interest expense over the remaining duration of the related debt obligation 
we did not enter into any interest rate swap agreements during or off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings 
on january  we completed the sale of our interest in our joint venture standard gypsum to the joint venture s other partner  temple inland  for million in cash and eliminated our guaranty and letter of credit support obligations with respect to standard gypsum s debt 
as a result of this sale  we no longer have any support obligation with respect to our half of standard gypsum s debt  which was million as of december   and we ceased to be entitled to any distributions from standard gypsum for all periods subsequent to january  we provided certain environmental indemnification not to exceed million for any claims related to events that occurred prior to the formation of the standard gypsum joint venture on april  this indemnification will terminate january  we did not record a liability related to this indemnification since the probability of an asserted claim was considered remote 
as of december  we owned a interest in one joint venture  premier boxboard llc  with temple inland 
because we account for the interest in this joint venture under the equity method of accounting  the indebtedness of the joint venture is not reflected in the liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheets 
premier boxboard is a low cost recycled paperboard mill that produces a lightweight gypsum facing paper along with containerboard grades 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report for summarized financial information for this joint venture 
funding for premier boxboard is generated by its internal cash flow and any cash contributions that we and our joint venture partner are required to make 
premier boxboard generated sufficient cash flow in to distribute million to us and million to our joint venture partner 
based on the cash flows and expected future cash flows  we do not expect premier boxboard to require external funding in the foreseeable future 
however  if premier boxboard were to require additional funding  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we and our joint venture partner were unable to adequately satisfy premier boxboard s funding requirements  its operations  and accordingly  our interest in it  could be adversely affected 
in addition  a substantial portion of the assets of premier boxboard are pledged as security for million in outstanding principal amount of senior notes under which premier boxboard is the obligor 
these notes are guaranteed by temple inland  but are not guaranteed by us 
in the event of a default under these notes  the holders would also have recourse to the assets of premier boxboard that are pledged to secure these notes 
thus  any resulting default under these notes could result in the assets of premier boxboard being utilized to satisfy creditor claims  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of premier boxboard and  accordingly  our interest in premier boxboard 
as of december   premier boxboard was in compliance with its debt covenants 
additional contingencies relating to our premier boxboard joint venture that could affect our liquidity include possible additional capital contributions and buy sell triggers which  under certain circumstances  give us and our joint venture partner either the right  or the obligation  to purchase the other s interest or to sell an interest to the other 
we are required  to the extent necessary  to make additional capital contributions to enable the joint venture to meet existing obligations 
under the premier boxboard joint venture agreement  in general  mutual buy sell rights are triggered upon the occurrence of involuntary transfers  and in the event of change of control  actual or imminent  of temple inland or its subsidiaries or in the event of a deadlock  as defined in the joint venture agreement 
the buy sell provisions are structured such that we are contemplated to be the purchaser in the event of any voluntary transfer of membership interest 
we generally consider our relationship with temple inland to be good with respect to our premier boxboard joint venture 
however  as described above  we could be required to fund premier boxboard s operations with additional cash contributions to the extent it is unable to fund operations with internally generated cash 
we cannot give assurance that material liquidity events will not arise with respect to our joint venture  and the occurrence of any such events could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

table of contents contractual obligations

see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
other long term liabilities exclude future pension liabilities  other postretirement benefit liabilities and deferred compensation benefit liabilities because we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities will be settled 
as of december   the noncurrent portion of our fin liability  including interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits  is million 
at this time the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our fin liability cannot be determined and therefore is excluded from this table

however  this table does not include the aggregate amount of routine purchase orders outstanding as of december  operating cash flows

included in this amount is the write off of approximately million of related goodwill 
dividends 
in february  we announced that we would suspend future dividend payments on our common stock until our earnings performance and cash flow improve 
our debt agreements contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends and currently preclude us from doing so 
inflation raw material and energy cost changes have had  and continue to have  a material negative effect on our operations 
we do not believe that general economic inflation is a significant determinant of our raw material and energy cost increases or that it has a material effect on our operations
