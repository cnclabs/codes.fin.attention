on a macro basis  the company is affected by non residential and infrastructure construction and industrial maintenance and capital improvement activities  worldwide steel mill production and capacity utilization  industrial production volume  and the general business trend towards the outsourcing of services 
the overall outlook for continues to be positive for most of these business drivers 
both international and domestic access services activity remains strong 
operating performance in for this segment has benefited  and is expected to continue to benefit in  from increased non residential and infrastructure construction spending and industrial services activity in the company s major markets  selective strategic investments and acquisitions in existing and new markets and expansion of current product lines  further market penetration from new services  service cross selling opportunities among the markets served  and enterprise business optimization opportunities including new technology applications  consolidated procurement  logistics and continuous process improvement initiatives 
further prudent global expansion and market share gains are also expected from this segment 
overall  the outlook for the mill services segment for remains positive 
however  margin improvement in this segment in is expected to be gradual as the effects of the margin improvement plans previously outlined are realized 
during  in order to maintain pricing levels  a more disciplined and consolidated steel industry has been adjusting production levels to bring inventories in line with current demand 
the company expects global steel production and consumption to increase at a sustainable pace in  which would generally have a favorable effect on this segment s revenues 
in addition  new contract signings and start ups  as well as the company s geographic expansion strategy  particularly eastern europe and the middle east  are expected to gradually have a positive effect on results in the longer term 
the company continues to engage in enterprise business optimization initiatives designed to improve operating results and margins 
however  the company may experience higher operating costs  such as maintenance and energy  that could have a negative impact on operating margins  to the extent these costs cannot be passed to customers 
the outlook for the all other category minerals rail services and products remains positive 
excell minerals is expected to continue to be accretive to earnings in  as full integration into the company continues to occur 
likewise  the railway track maintenance services and equipment business should continue to see improved year over year operating performance in contract opportunities for the business remain high such as the signing of significant orders from china in  which also provides confidence to the longer term outlook 
the remaining businesses within this group are also expected to continue to operate at their current high levels of operating effectiveness 
the stable or improved market conditions for most of the company s services and products and the significant investments made recently for acquisitions and growth related capital expenditures provide the base for achieving the company s stated growth objectives 
the record performance for revenue and operating income achieved in provides momentum for continued improvement in revenues by region total revenues twelve months ended december percentage growth from to dollars in millions volume currency total western europe north america latin america a middle east and africa eastern europe asia pacific total a includes mexico 
highlights the following significant items affected the company overall during in comparison with company wide continued strong worldwide economic activity  as well as the strong earnings performance of the excell minerals acquisition  benefited the company in this included increased access equipment services  especially in north america  europe and the middle east  and increased demand for air cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating products 
as expected  during  the company experienced higher fuel and energy related costs  as well as higher commodity costs for certain manufacturing businesses 
to the extent that such costs cannot be passed to customers in the future  operating income may be adversely affected 
consistent with its overall strategic focus on global industrial services  the company divested its gas technologies business group on december  during  international sales and operating income were and  respectively  of total sales and operating income 
this compares with levels of of sales and of operating income 
access services segment dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent access services segment significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues increased volume and new business impact of foreign currency translation acquisitions other revenues access services segment significant impacts on operating income in  the international access services business  europe and the middle east in particular  continued to improve due to increased non residential  multi dwelling residential and infrastructure construction spending 
the company has also benefited from its recent rental equipment capital investments made in these markets 
equipment rentals  particularly in the construction sector  are the highest margin revenue source in this segment 
continued strong north american non residential and infrastructure construction and industrial services markets had a positive effect on volume which caused overall margins and operating income in north america to improve during the myath chile and cleton northern europe acquisitions were accretive to earnings in the impact of foreign currency translation in increased operating income for this segment by million  compared with mill services segment dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent mill services segment significant effects on revenues in millions revenues impact of foreign currency translation acquisitions increased volume and new business other revenues mill services segment significant impacts on operating income operating income for was negatively impacted by increased operating and maintenance expenses as well as lower steel production in certain regions  particularly north america 
operating income for included higher severance and other restructuring charges of million compared with the fourth quarter acquisition of technic gum and the acquisitions of alexander mill services international amsi and performix increased operating income in compared to the impact of foreign currency translation in increased operating income for this segment by million compared with all other category minerals rail services and products dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent all other category minerals rail services and products significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues acquisitions principally excell minerals air cooled heat exchangers industrial grating products boiler and process equipment roofing granules and abrasives railway track maintenance services and equipment impact of foreign currency translation other revenues all other category minerals rail services and products significant effects on operating income the excell minerals acquisition was accretive to the category s performance in excell minerals had strong customer demand for its high value material recycling services  as well as favorable market pricing 
operating income for the air cooled heat exchangers business benefited in due to increased volume resulting from a continued strong natural gas market 
the increase in operating income for the industrial grating products business was due principally to strong demand  as well as lower raw material costs and a gain on the sale of an asset 
the boiler and process equipment business delivered improved results in due to increased equipment sales and favorable product mix 
despite lower volume for the roofing granules and abrasives business in  operating income increased due to price increases  which offset higher costs 
operating income for the railway track maintenance services and equipment business increased in compared with due to increased volume and reduced operating expenses for contract services  partially offset by the impact of reduced equipment sales volume 
the business also benefited from reduced raw material costs and a gain on the disposal of an asset 
the impact of foreign currency translation in increased operating income by million for this category compared to outlook  trends and strategies looking to and beyond  the following significant items  trends and strategies are expected to affect the company company wide the company will continue its disciplined focus on expanding its industrial services businesses  with a particular emphasis on prudently growing the access services segment  especially in emerging economies and other targeted markets 
growth is expected to be achieved through the provision of additional services to existing customers  new contracts in both developed and emerging markets  and selective strategic acquisitions  such as the february acquisition of excell minerals and the august acquisition of alexander mill services international 
additionally  new higher margin service and sales opportunities in railway track maintenance services and equipment will be pursued globally 
the company will continue to invest in selective strategic acquisitions and growth capital investments  however  management will continue to be very selective and disciplined in allocating capital  choosing projects with the highest economic value added eva potential 
the company will place a strong focus on corporate wide expansion into emerging economies in the coming years 
more specifically  within the next three to five years  the company s global growth strategies include steady  targeted expansion in the asia pacific  eastern europe  latin america  and middle east and africa to further complement the company s already strong presence throughout europe and north america 
this strategy is expected to result in doubling the company s presence in these markets to approximately of total company revenues 
the company will continue to implement enterprise business optimization initiatives across the company to further enhance margins for most businesses  especially the mill services segment 
these initiatives include improved supply chain and logistics management  operating site and capital employed optimization  and added emphasis on global procurement 
the company expects strong cash flow from operating activities in  exceeding the record of million achieved in this will support the company s growth initiatives and help reduce debt 
the continued growth of the chinese steel industry  as well as other asian emerging economies  could impact the company in several ways 
increased steel mill production in china  and in other asian countries  may provide additional service opportunities for the mill services segment 
however  increased asian steel exports could result in lower steel production in other parts of the world  affecting the company s customer base 
additionally  continued increased chinese economic activity may result in increased commodity costs in the future  which may adversely affect the company s manufacturing businesses 
the potential impact of these risks is currently unknown 
volatility in energy and commodity costs eg  fuel  natural gas  steel  etc 
and worldwide demand for these commodities could have an adverse impact on the company s operating costs and ability to obtain the necessary raw materials 
cost increases could result in reduced operating income for certain products  to the extent that such costs cannot be passed on to customers 
the effect of continued middle east armed hostilities on the cost of fuel and commodities is currently unknown  but it could have an adverse impact on the company s operating costs 
however  increased volatility in energy and commodity costs may provide additional service opportunities for the mill services segment and several businesses in the all other category minerals rail services and products as customers may tend to outsource more services to reduce overall costs 
such volatility may also provide opportunities for additional petrochemical plant maintenance and capital improvement projects 
the armed hostilities in the middle east could also have a significant effect on the company s operations in the region 
the potential impact of this risk is currently unknown 
this exposure is further discussed in part i  item a  risk factors 
foreign currency translation had an overall favorable effect on the company s sales  operating income and stockholders equity during in comparison to if the us dollar strengthens  particularly in relationship to the euro or british pound sterling  the impact on the company would generally be negative in terms of reduced sales  income and stockholders equity 
should the us dollar weaken further in relationship to these currencies  the impact on the company would generally be positive in terms of higher sales  income and stockholders equity 
total pension expense defined benefit  defined contribution and multi employer for is expected to be higher than the level due to increased volume which affects defined contribution and multi employer pension expense 
on a comparative basis  total pension expense in was million higher than due principally to increased multi employer and defined contribution pension expense resulting from increased volume in the access services segment 
defined benefit pension expense decreased million in compared to due primarily to higher plan asset bases in resulting from cash contributions and significant returns on plan assets in the decreases were partially offset by plan curtailment losses in the railway track maintenance services and equipment business 
defined benefit pension expense is expected to decline for the full year compared with due to the cash contributions in  including voluntary cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plans approximately million during and million during  mostly to the uk plan  coupled with the higher than expected plan asset returns in financial markets in the united states and in a number of other countries where the company operates have been volatile since mid due to the credit and liquidity issues in the market place 
this has adversely impacted the outlook for the overall us economy as economic activity slowed  creating increased downside risk to growth 
in europe  a more moderate pace of economic growth is expected in when compared with while the company s global footprint  diversity of services and products  long term mill services contracts  and large access services customer base mitigate the overall exposure to changes in any one single economy  further deterioration of the global economies could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
changes in worldwide interest rates  particularly in the united states and europe  could have a significant effect on the company s overall interest expense  as approximately of the company s borrowings are at variable interest rates as of december  in comparison to approximately at december  
the company manages the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt to preserve adequate funding flexibility  as well as control the effect of interest rate changes on consolidated interest expense 
strategies to further reduce related risks are under consideration 
as the company continues the strategic expansion of its global footprint and implements tax planning opportunities  the effective income tax rate is expected to be lower than the implementation of the company s enterprise wide lean sigma program in should provide long term efficiencies as the company embraces its enterprise optimization initiatives 
access services segment both the international and domestic access services businesses have experienced buoyant markets that are expected to remain stable into specifically  international and north american non residential and infrastructure construction activity continues at high volume levels 
the north american industrial maintenance and infrastructure activities are expected to remain at high levels 
the company will continue to emphasize prudent expansion of our geographic presence in this segment through entering new markets and further expansion in emerging economies  and will continue to leverage value added services and highly engineered forming  shoring and scaffolding systems to grow the business 
the company will continue to implement continuous process improvement initiatives including global procurement and logistics  the sharing of engineering knowledge and resources  continuous process improvement and lean sigma initiatives  optimizing the business under one standardized administrative and operating model at all locations worldwide  and on going analysis for other potential synergies across the operations 
mill services segment to maintain pricing levels  a more disciplined and consolidated steel industry has been adjusting production levels to bring inventories in line with current demand 
the company expects global steel production to increase modestly in  as inventory levels have declined during increased steel production would generally have a favorable effect on this segment s revenues 
further consolidation in the global steel industry is possible 
should additional transactions occur involving some of the steel industry s larger companies that are customers of the company  it would result in an increase in concentration of revenues and credit risk for the company 
if a large customer were to experience financial difficulty  or file for bankruptcy protection  it could adversely impact the company s income  cash flows and asset valuations 
as part of its credit risk management practices  the company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base 
further consolidation may also increase pricing pressure on the company and the competitive risk of services contracts which are due for renewal 
conversely  such consolidation may provide additional service opportunities for the company as the company believes it is well positioned competitively 
the company will continue to place significant emphasis on improving operating margins of this segment and gradual improvement is expected in margin improvements are most likely to be achieved through internal enterprise business optimization efforts  renegotiating or exiting underperforming contracts  principally in north america  divesting low margin product lines  continuing to execute a geographic expansion strategy in eastern europe  the middle east and africa  latin america and asia pacific  and implementing continuous process improvement initiatives including lean sigma projects  global procurement initiatives  site efficiency programs  technology enhancements  maintenance best practices programs  and reorganization actions 
all other category minerals rail services and products the company will emphasize prudent global expansion of excell minerals value added services of extracting high value metallic content from slag and responsibly handling and recycling residual materials 
market pricing volatility for some of the high value materials involved in certain excell minerals services could affect the operating results of this business either favorably or unfavorably 
international demand for the railway track maintenance services and equipment business s products and services is expected to be strong in the long term 
a large equipment order signed in with china is an example of the underlying strength of the international markets 
due to long lead times  this order is expected to generate revenues beginning in and beyond 
in addition  increased volume of higher margin contract services and enterprise business optimization initiatives are expected to improve margins on a long term basis 
worldwide supply and demand for steel and other commodities could have an adverse impact on raw material costs and the ability to obtain the necessary raw materials for several businesses in this category 
the company has implemented certain strategies to help ensure continued product supply to our customers and mitigate the potentially negative impact that rising steel and other commodity prices could have on operating income 
the abrasives business is expected to continue to perform well in the near term  although operating margins could be impacted by volatile energy prices that affect both production and transportation costs 
this business continues to pursue cost and site optimization initiatives and the use of more energy efficient equipment to help mitigate future energy related increases 
due to a strong natural gas market and additional north american opportunities  demand for air cooled heat exchangers is expected to remain strong into results of operations for  and a dollars are in millions  except per share information and percentages revenues from continuing operations cost of services and products sold selling  general and administrative expenses other expenses operating income from continuing operations interest expense income tax expense from continuing operations income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations diluted earnings per common share effective income tax rate for continuing operations consolidated effective income tax rate a all historical amounts in the results of operations section have been restated for comparative purposes to reflect discontinued operations
