item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies  significant judgments  and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty obligations  self insured healthcare claims  income taxes  and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and current market conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation of marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty costs  self insured health insurance costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on our standard products when title passes to the customer upon shipment 
while our standard products generally require installation  the installation is considered a perfunctory performance obligation 
standard products do not have customer acceptance criteria 
generally  software is a component of our standard product and  as such  is not separately recognized as revenue 
we have standard rights of return that we account for as a warranty provision under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we do not have any price protection agreements or other post shipment obligations 
for custom equipment where customer acceptance is part of the sales agreement  revenue is recognized when the customer has accepted the product 
in cases where custom equipment does not have customer acceptance as part of the sales agreement  we recognize revenue upon shipment as long as the system meets the specifications as agreed upon with the customer 
certain transactions have multiple deliverables  with the deliverables clearly defined 
to the extent that the secondary deliverables are other than perfunctory  we recognize the revenue on each deliverable  if separable  or on the completion of all deliverables  if not separable  all in a manner consistent with sab no 
and eitf standalone software products are recognized as revenue when they are shipped 
revenue generated from development contracts are recorded on a cost plus basis in the period services are rendered 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns  and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit from our customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated future usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgment is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred based on management s estimates will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for our products  and technological obsolescence 
management estimates future product sales and service requirements  and evaluates technological changes and other possible uses to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and loss accruals may be required 
other than temporary impairment of marketable securities marketable securities have been primarily classified as held to maturity  which requires them to be carried at amortized cost 
we also have certain securities that are classified as available for sale and trading 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of marketable securities on a quarterly basis 
marketable securities with unrealized depreciation in fair value for twelve or more consecutive months and other securities with unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
investment ratings  company specific events  general economic conditions  and other reasons are evaluated in determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security is valued at the current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  share based payment as amended using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we consider historical warranty costs actually incurred and specifically identified circumstances to establish the warranty liability 
the warranty liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
a one percent change in actual costs would have an impact of approximately  on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an estimated realizable amount based on historical and forecasted results 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes to the valuation allowance  changes in pre tax income between jurisdictions that have higher or lower tax rates  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on july  among other tax guidance  fin requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax positions 
as a result of this adoption  we recognized a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits of million  an increase in income tax receivables of million  and a charge of approximately million to the july  retained earnings balance 
as of the adoption date  we had gross tax affected unrecognized tax benefits of million  of which million  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
due to our net operating loss carryforwards  we have accrued no interest and penalties for the unrecognized tax benefits  however  our accounting policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense 
penalties  if incurred  would be recognized as a component of income tax expense 
in the normal course of business  we provide for uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits accordingly 
for the year ended june   we recognized an additional liability of million for uncertain tax positions 
the total liability for uncertain tax liabilities was million at june  we are not aware of any tax positions that would create a significant adjustment to the unrecognized tax benefits during july  through june  valuation of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected  a current period operating loss or cash flow decline combined with a history of operating loss or cash flow uses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses  and a current expectation that  it s more likely than not  a long lived asset will be disposed of at a loss before the end of its estimated useful life 
if one or more of such facts or circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the assets is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets based on a current market value of the assets 
if a current market value is not readily available  a projected discounted cash flow method is applied using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
health insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance 
we rely on claims experience in determining an adequate liability for claims incurred  but not reported 
to the extent actual claims exceed estimates  we may be required to record additional expense 
a one percent change in actual claims would have an impact of approximately  on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview zygo corporation is a worldwide supplier of optical metrology instruments  precision optics  and electro optical design and manufacturing services  serving customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and industrial markets 
optical instruments products encompass non contact optical measurement instruments 
optics products consist of high performance macro optics components  optical coatings  and optical system assemblies 
we conduct the majority of our manufacturing in our  square foot facility in middlefield  connecticut and a  square foot leased facility in tucson  arizona 
on february   we acquired certain assets of solvision  inc solvision  a canadian based company  including the shares of its singapore subsidiary  for million in cash net of cash received 
in addition  the company had also loaned to solvision million of which was recouped as part of the purchase price allocation based on asset values 
with this acquisition  we entered the market for in line inspection of flip chip substrates and ic packaging 
included in the acquisition is the patented fmi technology for rapid d inspection 
we anticipate that continued development of the fmi head and flip chip substrate equipment will occur in montreal and that the ic packaging inspection product line will continue to be developed and manufactured in singapore 
during fiscal  we introduced a multiple application single sensor metrology tool for wafer measurements at nanometeres and below 
we continued strong growth in the medical sector driven by ophthalmic applications and state of the art dental device design and manufacturing 
during the latter half of fiscal  we also formed a majority owned joint venture in china to develop and assemble products designed for the local market 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we reorganized the business into two operating divisions metrology solutions metrology segment and optical systems optics segment 
consistent with our new business structure  beginning with our second quarter in fiscal we reported our segments as metrology and optics 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  our segments were reported as semiconductor and industrial 
we believe that within the metrology segment  the semiconductor market continues to contain our best sales growth opportunities for the future 
as such  we are focusing our research and development efforts on specific semiconductor initiatives  most notably in the display and packaging markets 
during the past year  we expanded our office in oregon  which houses our semiconductor process metrology group  to take advantage of opportunities in the semiconductor markets 
additionally  we have expanded our flat panel support infrastructure to support our backlog 
within our optics segment  areas of growth continue to be in laser fusion optics and medical based products 
during fiscal  our optics segment received a million initial order for long range night vision surveillance systems 
these systems serve a variety of critical homeland security  department of defense and department of energy applications 
our backlog at june  was million  an increase of million from june  orders were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal orders for the fourth quarter from the company s metrology segment accounted for of the orders received  with the optics segment accounting for the remaining 
for fiscal  orders were million  a decrease of over fiscal as we have previously disclosed  orders for our lithography oem products have experienced a sharp decline but have recently stabilized 
we anticipate that the order rate for the lithography oem products will remain constant for the foreseeable future but at a lower rate than in the past 
during the latter half of fiscal  we have seen an increase in display systems orders 
as previously announced  in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
as of june   we have repurchased million of our outstanding common shares 
repurchases occur from time to time as market conditions warrant through transactions in the open market 
the share repurchases are effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with rule b under the securities exchange act of this rule allows public companies to adopt written  pre arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material  non public information in their possession 
the adoption of this stock trading plan allows us to repurchase our shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total net sales in the metrology segment decreased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in net sales of million within the metrology segment was primarily due to volume decreases in lithography sales of million  display sales of million  and semiconductor sales of million  partially offset by an increase in instrument sales of million and vision systems from the solvision acquisition of million 
the increase in instrument sales was primarily due to a million increase in sales in our europe region based on volume 
net sales in the optics segment increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increase in net sales of million within the optics segment was primarily due to an increased volume of laser and precision optics of million  offset by a decrease in contract manufacturing sales  which includes medical components  of million

gross profit as a percentage of sales in the optics segment decreased by four percentage points for fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to shipments in the first half of fiscal for the initial production run of the helmet mounted display units that resulted in zero margin due to cost over runs on the initial units 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal increased million primarily due to increases in selling and marketing activities of million  partially offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses of million

the decrease in general and administrative costs was primarily related to a reduction in employee costs of million  including management bonus and employee profit sharing expense  offset by an increase for vision systems of million for the first four months of operation  and of million related to share based compensation expense 
research  development  and engineering expenses rd e year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales the increase in rd e costs in fiscal was primarily related to increased spending on semiconductor initiatives of million  display solutions of million and vision systems of million  and within the optics division of million 
these rd e cost increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in our precision positioning systems and instruments business 
we continue to focus and build on our semiconductor initiatives as one of our core areas of expected future growth 
income tax expense year ended dollars in millions june  tax rate june  tax rate the overall tax rate increased by one percentage point when compared with the prior year primarily due to the repeal of the deduction attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion eie on december  net earnings year ended dollars in millions june  sales june  sales net earnings in fiscal decreased by as compared with the prior year 
net earnings per diluted share were for fiscal  as compared with per diluted share for fiscal the decreased earnings were primarily the result of decreased net sales in precision positioning systems  display solutions  and semiconductor solutions and increased sg a and r d expenses due to additional spending within instruments  the semiconductor initiatives and the inclusion of solvision operating expenses  which are reflected in our results for the last four months of the fiscal year 
backlog backlog at june  totaled million  an increase of million  from june  the year end fiscal backlog consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
orders for fiscal totaled million 
orders by segment for fiscal consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
we enter fiscal with a strong display solutions backlog 
as we have previously disclosed  orders for our lithography oem products have experienced a sharp decline but have recently stabilized 
we anticipate that the order rate for the lithography oem products will remain constant for the foreseeable future but at a lower rate than in the past 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total net sales in the metrology segment increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year

significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the sales of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
gross profit year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total gross profit in the metrology segment as a percentage of net sales increased by two percentage points in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the decrease in development services revenues  which comprised of metrology revenue in fiscal and only in fiscal and which has historically carried margins of 
gross profit in the optics segment as a percentage of sales increased by ten percentage points for fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to having a steady order flow within our contract manufacturing operation which increased our efficiency and productivity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal included increases in sales and marketing of million primarily due to increases in marketing activities of million for our semiconductor products and million for our optical systems solutions 
we also incurred additional costs of million as we increased our presence throughout our foreign operations 
administration expenses decreased slightly by million 
research  development  and engineering expenses rd e year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales the increase in rd e costs in fiscal was primarily related to increased spending on our semiconductor initiatives of million  display solutions of million  instrument projects of million  and contract manufacturing projects of million 
semiconductor rd e contributed to the release  in fiscal  of two new products  the zd tm and the unifire tm 
display solution initiatives include developments of new technologies to further enhance our existing product line 
income tax expense year ended dollars in millions june  tax rate june  tax rate income tax expense in fiscal increased by as compared with the prior year 
the overall tax rate increased by eight percentage points when compared with the prior year 
in fiscal  income tax expense included an aggregate tax benefit of million due primarily to the redetermination of our fiscal and extraterritorial income exclusion eie

net earnings per diluted share were for fiscal  as compared with per diluted share for fiscal fiscal net earnings included a benefit for the effect of the eie credit related to fiscal and of million 
the increased earnings were primarily the result of increased net sales and increased gross profits as a percentage of sales which was partially offset by a million increase in rd e to support our new initiatives 
transactions with stockholder sales to canon  a stockholder  customer  and distributor of certain of our products in japan amounted to million of net sales  million of net sales  and million of net sales for the years ended june    and  respectively 
selling prices of products sold to canon are based  generally  on the normal terms customarily given to distributors 
revenues generated from a development contract with canon were recorded on a cost plus basis 
at june  and  there was in the aggregate  million and million  respectively  of trade accounts receivable from canon 
in september  we entered into a contract with canon related to the development of certain interferometers 
in march  we signed a preliminary agreement to begin further add on work  the definitive agreement for this additional work was signed in december in february  we entered into two additional agreements with canon related to the development of prototype production tools and accessories 
during the twelve months ended june   we recognized revenue of million under the canon development services contract compared with million for the comparable prior period 
our development services contract with canon was completed during the third quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and marketable securities was million  a decrease of million from million at june  the decrease in cash was primarily attributable to million used to fund the repurchase of the company stock and million that was used for the purchase of the solvision assets 
excluding the purchase of the company stock and the purchase of the solvision assets  cash and marketable securities would have increased million year over year 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal as compared with million in fiscal operating cash flows in fiscal were impacted primarily by decreased net earnings offset by a decrease in inventories 
cash flows provided by investing activities for fiscal were million as compared with cash flows used by investing activities of million in fiscal purchases and proceeds of marketable securities activities were million and million  respectively  in fiscal and million and million  respectively  in fiscal acquisitions of property  plant  and equipment were million in fiscal as compared with million for fiscal on february   we acquired certain assets of solvision  including the shares of its singapore subsidiary  for million in cash net of cash received 
in addition  the company had also loaned to solvision million of which was allocated to the value of assets received 
cash flows used for financing activities for fiscal were million as compared with cash flows provided by financing activities of million in fiscal in august  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million 
we have repurchased million of stock through june  although cash requirements will fluctuate during the fiscal year  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our million bank line of credit agreement at june  and the agreement contains certain financial covenants which  among others  relate to debt service and consolidated debt ratios 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period dollars in millions less than more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt  or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any obligations of a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  changes in the investment grade of marketable securities  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities including institutional money market funds which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and us treasury securities  government agency securities  and corporate bonds 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly on our short term instruments 
the table below presents investment amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
fair value of investments as of june  maturing in dollars in millions thereafter marketable securities fixed rate investments weighted average interest rate on june   the company had variable interest rate money market accounts valued at million 
marketable securities fair market value sensitivity at june   our investment portfolio included auction rate securities of million of which million is believed to have risk exposure in sub prime markets 
we have reviewed  along with our investment advisor  current investment ratings  company specific events  and general economic conditions in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
to the extent we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security will be valued at the then current fair value and an impairment charge will be reflected in earnings 
in addition  if the investment grades of the securities decline  liquidity in the market may be restricted or the market value of the security may decline 
there also is the possibility that  if credit limits tighten significantly  the issuer may not have access to the capital markets to pay off the securities at the time of maturity 
exchange rate sensitivity approximately of our fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars 
at june   our backlog included orders in us dollars of million  or of the total backlog 
substantially all of our costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact sales of our products in export markets as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our sales that are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
we enter into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
these forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to nine months 
any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would largely offset corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions and foreign operations are denominated in the euro and japanese yen 
in the absence of a substantial increase in sales orders in currencies other than us dollars  we believe a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and yen would have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
