inhibitex  mscramm  veronate  aurexis and fermavir are registered trademarks of inhibitex  inc overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated anti infective products to prevent and treat serious infections 
in  we adopted a strategy to pursue pre clinical or clinical stage antiviral development programs via in licensing or acquisition  and postponed the initiation of any additional clinical trials of aurexis or other preclinical programs based on our mscramm platform  pending the outcome of this new strategic direction 
in connection with this strategy  we entered into the following transactions as described below 
on april   we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with fermavir pharmaceuticals  inc  or fermavir 
on september   we consummated the acquisition of fermavir 
fermavir s antiviral pipeline included fv  a nucleoside analogue for the treatment of herpes zoster infections shingles  and a series of preclinical nucleoside analogues for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus  or cmv disease 
on september  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the university of georgia research foundation  or ugarf  for intellectual property covering a series of compounds for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  integrase inhibitors  as well as small molecule compounds for the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv infections in exchange for an upfront license fee  future milestone payments and royalties on future net sales 
in connection with this license agreement  we also entered into a 
table of contents sponsored research agreement with ugarf to provide up to three years of financial support for specified research and development activities related to the licensed compounds and intellectual property 
on november   we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with cardiff university in wales  united kingdom and katholieke universiteit in leuven  belgium for intellectual property covering a series of hcv polymerase inhibitors in exchange for an upfront license fee  future milestone payments and royalties on future net sales 
the licensed compounds include a series of nucleoside analogs that inhibit nsb  an rna dependent rna polymerase  which is a critical enzyme in the lifecycle of hcv 
as a result of these transactions  we have transitioned our focus with respect to the anti infective market and are primarily concentrating on the development of small molecule antiviral compounds 
we are currently targeting our development efforts on therapies for shingles  hiv infection  chronic hepatitis c and cmv 
due to this strategic transformation  we have exited the development stage for financial statement presentation and all periods prior to october  were presented as a development stage company 
currently available antiviral therapies have various therapeutic limitations  such as inadequate potency  diminishing efficacy due to the emergence of drug resistance viral strains  and patient non compliance with certain treatment regimens due to toxicity  adverse side effects  complex dosing schedules and inconvenient routes of administration 
we believe that our drug candidates may have the potential to address a number of these limitations and unmet needs in their respective  intended indications 
from our inception in to mid  we devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts towards the discovery and development of novel antibody based products for the prevention and treatment of serious bacterial and fungal infections  all of which were based upon our proprietary mscramm protein platform 
in november  we completed enrollment of a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of veronate  our lead product candidate at that time  which we had been developing for the prevention of hospital associated staphylococcal aureus infections in premature  very low birth weight infants 
on april   we announced that this pivotal phase iii trial did not achieve its primary endpoint  or any of its secondary endpoints 
in light of these phase iii trial results  we discontinued the development of veronate  reduced our work force and realigned our operations consistent with the status of other then existing development programs 
we believe there may be significant business advantages on focusing on the development of drugs to treat infectious diseases  including the following the emergence of drug resistance creates a continuing need for new drugs to treat viral diseases  thus creating new markets and growing business opportunities  infectious disease research and development programs generally have shorter development cycle times when compared to various therapeutic areas such as oncology  cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders  and historical data suggest that anti infective development programs that enter clinical development have a higher clinical success rate as compared to various other therapeutic areas such as oncology  cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders 
we have neither received regulatory approval for any of our current or past product candidates  nor do we have any commercialization capabilities  therefore  it is possible that we may never successfully derive any new collaboration revenues or any commercial revenues from any of our existing or future product candidates 
we expect that for the foreseeable future  our future operations will result in a net loss on a quarterly and yearly basis for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
background infectious diseases are caused by pathogens present in the environment  such as viruses  bacteria and fungi  which enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes and overwhelm its natural defenses 
some infections are systemic  meaning they affect the entire body  while others may be localized in one organ or system within the body 
the severity of infectious diseases varies depending on the nature of the infectious agent  as well as the degree to 
table of contents which the body s immune system can fight the infection 
the market for anti infective drugs can be divided into three main categories antiviral  anti bacterial and antifungal 
the widespread use of anti infective drugs has led to a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases 
however  for many infectious diseases  current treatment options are associated with suboptimal treatment outcomes  significant drug related adverse side effects  complex dosing schedules and inconvenient methods of administration  such as injection or infusion 
these factors often lead to patients discontinuing treatment or failing to comply fully with treatment dosing schedules 
as a result  physicians are often required to modify therapy regimens throughout the course of treatment 
moreover  in recent years  the increasing prevalence of drug resistance has created ongoing treatment challenges with respect to many infectious diseases 
the ability of both viruses and bacteria to adapt rapidly to existing or new treatments through genetic mutations allows new strains to develop that are highly resistant to currently available drugs 
in addition  a patient s failure to comply fully with a treatment regimen can both accelerate and exacerbate drug resistance 
viruses viruses are submicroscopic infectious agents consisting of an outer layer of protein surrounding a core of genetic material comprised of dna or rna 
viruses require living host cells to grow and multiply 
in many cases  the body s immune system can effectively combat an infection caused by a virus 
however  with certain viral infections  the body s immune system is unable to destroy the virus  which results in persistent viral replication and the subsequent infection of healthy cells by the virus 
this ultimately leads to the deterioration or destruction of the infected cells  resulting in disease 
infections caused by virus can be both acute and chronic infection 
acute infection is associated with viruses such as influenza  and generally causes disease that lasts for a short period of time and can self resolve 
chronic infections may either be latent or active 
a latent virus  such as varicella zoster or cmv  can remain in the body for long periods of time  and generally only cause disease when the body s immune system fails or is suppressed 
an active virus causes disease over a long period of time  as seen with both chronic hcv and hiv 
antiviral drugs are designed to treat and or prevent viral diseases 
antiviral drugs are generally specific for a specific virus  but some are active against a number of viruses 
antiviral drugs work by stopping viral replication  thereby allowing the body to eliminate the virus  or by significantly inhibiting viral replication and allowing the body s immune system to eliminate the virus 
viruses that develop resistance to antiviral drugs are a major challenge for the treatment of viral infections 
the ability of viruses to mutate spontaneously during replication allows drug resistant strains to emerge when patients are on treatment regimens that do not quickly and completely inhibit viral replication 
resistance occurs because viruses continually make billions of copies of themselves every day  some of which will contain mutations in their genetic material 
mutations that confer a replication advantage in the presence of a suppressive antiviral drug will give rise to viral strains that are resistant or partially resistant to that drug 
these mutated viruses  while initially found in low numbers  will eventually become the predominant strain in an infected patient 
once this occurs  the treatment benefit of the antiviral drug diminishes or disappears  which may result in treatment failure and create a need for an alternate therapy with different or possibly new drugs or classes of drugs 
bacteria bacteria are unicellular  self propagating microorganisms that multiply through growth in bacterial cell size and the subsequent division of the cell 
bacteria can be broadly classified into two categories based upon the composition of their cell walls gram positive or gram negative 
many antibacterial drugs that are effective against gram positive bacteria are less effective or ineffective against gram negative bacteria  and vice versa 
antibacterial drugs that are active against a large number of both classes of bacteria are often referred to as broad spectrum anti bacterials 
currently marketed anti bacterials  or antibiotics  have historically proved highly successful in controlling the morbidity and mortality that accompany bacterial infections 
due to the widespread use of antibiotics over time and the ability of bacteria to develop drug resistance  many of these antibiotics now have diminished or limited antibacterial activity 
the inability to effectively treat serious infections caused by drug resistant bacteria has led to increased mortality rates  prolonged hospitalizations and increased health care costs 

table of contents our product candidates the following table summarizes key information regarding our product candidates current drug stage of marketing candidate indication development current status rights antivirals fv herpes zoster shingles clinical initiating phase i single ascending dose trial inhibitex hiv integrase inhibitors hiv infection preclinical lead optimization studies in progress inhibitex hcv polymerase inhibitors chronic hcv infection preclinical lead optimization studies in progress inhibitex hcmv hcmv infection preclinical lead optimization studies in progress inhibitex antibacterials aurexis serious s 
aureus infections phase iia completed phase iia inhibitex staphylococcal vaccines active vaccine preclinical preclinical studies in progress wyeth diagnostics various pre market development m fv for shingles fv is a nucleoside analogue prodrug we are developing for the treatment of varicella zoster virus  or vzv  the causative agent for herpes zoster  or shingles  and chicken pox 
published preclinical studies demonstrate that fv is significantly more potent than acyclovir  valacyclovir valtrex  and famciclovir famvir  the only fda approved drugs for the treatment of shingles 
preclinical studies indicate that fv can enter vzv infected cells and fully inhibit the replication of vzv much more rapidly than acyclovir  and at significantly lower concentration levels 
we believe these characteristics may provide the potential for fv  and its antivirally active derivative cf  to reduce the incidence  severity  and duration of shingles related symptoms  including rash  blisters  acute pain and post herpetic neuralgia  or phn 
in addition  preclinical and early clinical pharmacokinetic data suggest that fv may have the potential to be dosed orally once a day 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated and completed a phase i clinical trial of fv under an exploratory investigational new drug application  or ind  in the united states 
this trial evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of three doses of fv in healthy volunteers 
there were no serious adverse events observed and that fv appeared to be generally well tolerated in the trial 
we recently completed a series of ind enabling studies and we plan to submit a regular ind for fv 
table of contents and initiate a phase i trial evaluating single ascending  and then multiple ascending  doses in healthy volunteers in the first half of market opportunity for the treatment of shingles vzv  a dna virus and a member of the herpes virus group  is the sole cause of both chickenpox and herpes zoster  or shingles  in humans 
initial infections with vzv generally occur during childhood and result in chickenpox 
after the primary chickenpox infection subsides  vzv remains latent in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia 
individuals who have had chickenpox are at risk for reactivation of the vzv virus  or shingles 
although shingles can occur in any individual with a previous vzv infection  its incidence varies with age and immune status  which are the key risk factors 
in  there were an estimated million cases of shingles in the us in europe and japan  the estimated number of shingles cases is and million  respectively 
shingles is largely a disease of the aged or aging  with over of all cases occurring in individuals over the age of  and approximately of the cases occurring in individuals over the age of due to the aging population  the increasing use of immunosuppressive agents in transplant patients  and the increased numbers of immunosuppressed patients from cancer therapy  the incidence of shingles is expected to increase 
it is estimated that approximately to of all persons in the us will suffer from shingles during their lifetime 
the symptoms associated with shingles generally include a localized rash  blisters  and acute pain 
shingles generally starts as small blisters with new blisters continuing to form for three to five days 
the blisters generally follow the path of individual nerves that emanate from the spinal cord 
eventually  the blisters will burst and the infected areas will begin to ooze and eventually crust over and heal 
the course of the infection takes two to four weeks to complete 
on occasion  blisters may never appear  but pain will be present 
fewer than of patients experience significant systemic symptoms from shingles  such as fever  headache  malaise  or fatigue 
the pain associated with shingles is a result of damage to the nerve fibers caused by the reactivation of vzv 
pain symptoms are commonly described as a burning sensation with bouts of stabbing and shooting pain  often set off by touching the infected area 
the majority of shingles patients will experience acute pain in connection with their infection 
in some patients  the shingles related pain does not resolve when the rash heals but  rather  continues for months or possibly years 
this persistent pain is referred to as post herpetic neuralgia  or phn  and it is the most common complication of shingles 
approximately of shingles patients experience phn  although the incidence of phn increases dramatically in patients over years of age where approximately half of the patients will experience shingles related phn 
previous studies have established that additional risk factors for phn include greater acute pain intensity  greater severity of the rash  and the presence and greater severity of a painful prodrome preceding the rash 
in  merck co  inc received approval to market a shingles vaccine called zostavax to patients years of age and older 
clinical data indicated that the vaccine can reduce the incidence of shingles by approximately in this population 
we are not aware of any other vaccine under development for the prevention of shingles 
acyclovir zovirax  valacyclovir valtrex a prodrug of acyclovir  and famciclovir famvir a prodrug of penciclovir are oral antivirals currently indicated and approved to treat shingles 
all of these drugs are referred to as pan herpetic drugs  in that they were developed  and are currently being used  to treat various infections caused by viruses in the herpes virus group  including herpes simplex and in fact  it is estimated that approximately of the over billion in annual sales these three drugs generate based on the current pricing are for non shingles use 
accordingly  we currently estimate the size of the market for oral antivirals to treat shingles may exceed million per year 
clinical trial data indicate that administration of these pan herpetic drugs within hours of the appearance of a shingles related rash can lessen the duration of shingles symptoms 
while these drugs are generally well tolerated  
table of contents side effects include nausea  headache  diarrhea and vomiting 
a course of treatment with the currently approved fda drugs for shingles is generally to days 
limitations of current therapies currently approved pan herpetic drugs that are used to treat shingles have a number of limitations  including the following no fda approved label for the prevention of phn 
currently  there are no oral antiviral therapies indicated for the prevention of phn 
there is also no cure for phn  rather  treatment focuses on relieving pain 
the most commonly prescribed medications are strong pain relievers containing opioids  antidepressants  anticonvulsants and a topical lidocaine patch 
based upon previously published data evaluating the impact of antiviral therapy on phn  we believe a highly potent  fast acting anti vzv compound may have the potential to more rapidly inhibit the replication of vzv  thus reducing the potential for shingles related nerve damage and therefore  phn 
we believe an antiviral therapy that can reduce phn may have a significant competitive advantage relative to the current oral antiviral shingles therapies 
lack of convenience 
due to their pharmacokinetic properties  current pan herpetic oral antiviral therapies to treat shingles require patients to take oral doses each day for to days 
specifically  current dosing regimens are as follows famvir mg  times per day  valtrex mg  times per day  zovirax mg  times per day 
given the fact that many of these patients are elderly and taking other medications  such dosing regimens are inconvenient and can result in non compliance and hence  less than optimal treatment outcomes 
we believe that a convenient  once a day oral administration of an effective antiviral therapy may have a competitive advantage relative to current shingles therapies 
antiviral drug dosing must be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function 
although current antiviral therapies are generally safe and well tolerated  the doses of valtrex  famvir and zovirax need to be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal kidney function to avoid potential adverse events 
we believe that an oral antiviral drug that has a similar safety profile to valtrex  zovirax  and famvuir but is not required to be adjusted for patients with renal insufficiency may have a competitive advantage over currently approved shingles therapies 
we believe there is an unmet need for more potent and faster acting antiviral agents such as fv that may have the potential to reduce the incidence  severity  and duration of shingles related symptoms  including rash  blisters  acute pain and phn 
due to its potency and rapid penetration of infected cells  we also believe that the amount of fv necessary to inhibit viral replication may be significantly lower than that of the current antiviral therapies  resulting in smaller doses and potentially fewer and less severe side effects 
we also believe that the pharmacokinetic properties of fv  as observed to date in vitro and in the phase i trial we conducted under an exploratory ind in late  may provide for less frequent oral dosing than valtrex  zovirax  and famvir 
fv clinical trials phase i 
in december  we reported the results from a blinded  placebo controlled single ascending dose phase i clinical trial that was conducted in the united states under an exploratory investigational new drug application ind and evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of three oral doses of fv  and mg in healthy volunteers 
each of the three dose cohorts consisted of six subjects that received fv and two that received placebo 
there were no serious adverse events observed and that the compound appeared to be generally well tolerated in the trial 
in addition  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all three doses achieved plasma levels of cf which exceeded the ec  with the mg dose maintaining such levels for approximately twelve hours 
the ec represents the concentration of drug that is required for inhibition of viral replication in vitro 

table of contents hiv integrase inhibitors integrase inhibitors are an emerging class of anti retroviral agents being developed for the treatment of hiv 
this class of compounds blocks or inhibits the insertion of hiv viral dna into the genome of the host cell  thereby stopping the virus from replicating 
by inhibiting a different molecular target than other classes of hiv drugs  such as reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors  integrase inhibitors may have the potential to treat patients with resistant strains of hiv 
preclinical studies of our integrase inhibitors have demonstrated that the compounds are potent and orally available  exhibit multiple mechanisms of integrase inhibition in vitro and have the potential to be active against hiv strains that are resistant to other anti retroviral classes as well as integrase inhibitors currently in clinical development 
we are currently performing lead optimization studies to select a lead candidate from this program in the future 
market opportunity for the treatment of hiv hiv destroys the body s ability to fight infections by attacking cells of the immune system 
in  the first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  or aids  were documented  and in  hiv was identified as the cause of aids 
in the united states  the cdc has reported that the hiv mortality rate has steadily declined since the mid to late s  while the incidence of infection continues to rise 
this decrease in mortality can be attributed  in part  to the increased availability of anti retroviral therapeutics used in the long term treatment of hiv 
according to a recent unaids who report  by the end of  approximately million people in north america and  people in western and central europe were living with hiv and an additional  new patients in north america and  new patients in western and central europe are diagnosed each year 
the hiv market generated an estimated billion of sales in midas sales data  ims health  may and experienced a cagr of from to it is expected that the hiv market will grow to billion by datamonitor  commercial insight  hiv 
to date  the fda has approved more than single agents  including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  or nrtis  non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  or nnrtis  protease inhibitors  or pis  entry inhibitors  and recently an integrase inhibitor  as well as multiple fixed dose combination therapies for the treatment of hiv 
nrtis mimic natural nucleosides and are commonly referred to as nucleoside analogs 
in the body  nrtis block viral replication by interfering with the ability of reverse transcriptase to make a dna copy of hiv rna 
this occurs because this enzyme incorporates the nucleoside analogs instead of the natural nucleosides into newly synthesized viral dna  causing the premature termination of the dna chain 
this impairs either the synthesis or the functionality of the new viral genome  thereby suppressing viral replication 
nnrtis are composed of a diverse group of compounds unrelated to nucleosides that also directly target the reverse transcriptase 
these drugs bind to the enzyme  causing a change in the shape of the enzyme that makes it less efficient in producing dna 
protease inhibitors target an hiv enzyme that is required to make fully mature and infectious virus 
this enzyme processes the viral proteins required to create a protective protein shell that surrounds the hiv rna 
the protease inhibitor class of compounds prevents the hiv protease from making mature virus capable of infecting other cells 
entry inhibitors work outside the cell by inhibiting a virus from entering and infecting the cell 

integrase inhibitors represent on of the newest class of hiv drugs to be approved by the fda 
these drugs prevent the integrase enzyme from integrating the viral genetic material into human chromosomes  a critical step in the pathogenesis of hiv 
the standard treatment for hiv infection  as recommended by the us department of health and human services  includes two nrtis combined with a third drug from another class  either an nnrti or a protease inhibitor  to form a triple combination therapy known as highly active anti retroviral therapy  or haart 
the two nrtis in haart are usually analogs of different nucleosides 
nrtis  nnrtis  pis and integrase inhibitors are generally administered orally as a tablet or capsule 
in addition  several of the drugs in these classes are effective when taken only once each day 
in treatment na ve individuals  a once daily therapy has been shown to improve compliance with the prescribed treatment regimen  which leads to 
table of contents better treatment outcomes 
to provide additional convenience  companies have developed combination therapies that combine two or more nrtis into a single tablet or capsule 
these fixed dose combination therapies have become leaders in the hiv marketplace 
as patients develop resistance to their therapies  they are switched to other treatments 
increasingly  potency against drug resistant virus has become more important than convenience in treatment experienced patients 
hiv s inherent ability to mutate results in the occurrence of about one mutation in every new virus particle produced 
with over ten million virus particles produced within a hour period  it is possible to observe every conceivable genetic mutation each day  although not all mutated viruses are viable 
when a drug resistant form of hiv first arises  it usually comprises a very small percentage of the hiv circulating within the blood 
as the original or wild type virus continues to be suppressed by antiviral therapy and the drug resistant hiv continues to replicate  the mutated virus eventually becomes the dominant virus type 
to reduce the likelihood of a dominant drug resistant mutation  patients must comply with their treatment regimens 
each of the fda approved hiv therapies is susceptible to a mutation that confers drug resistance 
new drug resistant forms of hiv continue to emerge  and as a result  new nrti s  nnrti s  pis  integrase inhibitors and other new classes of anti retroviral therapies to fight drug resistant hiv will continue to be needed 
as previously described  haart  the current standard of care for patients infected with hiv  is comprised of three or more drugs that are ideally directed against different viral targets 
this approach is based on two principles 
first  the onset of viral resistance can be delayed by using multiple drugs that maximally suppress viral replication  thereby making it more difficult for a virus to generate the mutations that allow for the emergence of dominant drug resistant virus 
second  based on scientific studies  it is much more difficult for drug resistant virus to arise in the presence of drugs that inhibit different viral targets such as reverse transcriptase  protease  and integrase 
limitations of current therapies currently approved anti retroviral drugs have significant limitations  including the following development of drug resistance 
ongoing viral replication in patients on a haart regimen results in the emergence of viral strains that are no longer susceptible to one or more components of the treatment regimen 
if left unchecked  this may lead to treatment failure 
in addition  development of resistance to certain drugs can lead to cross resistance  or resistance to other drugs of the same class  thus rendering a whole class of drugs ineffective 
in order to maintain viral suppression  patients failing a haart regimen are switched to a new regimen comprised of drugs that are not cross resistant with drugs from previous regimens 
short half lives of currently available therapies 
many of the currently available drugs have relatively short plasma half lives  meaning the length of time that the drug remains in the patient s bloodstream  as well as relatively short intracellular half lives  meaning the length of time the drug remains in the patient s cells 
short half lives require patients to take their medications more frequently  or in the case of once daily dosing  to take doses within a certain timeframe 
if patients miss this window  or forget entirely to take their medication  the amount of drug in the bloodstream diminishes  creating an opportunity for increased viral replication and the emergence of drug resistance 
inadequate patient compliance 
a patient s ability to adhere to a haart regimen will significantly impact the treatment outcome 
virologic failure rates have been found to be inversely correlated to the level of compliance 
the chronic nature of aids and the long term adverse side effects associated with certain drugs  such as the loss of subcutaneous fat associated with certain nrtis  affect the ability of hiv patients to adhere perfectly or nearly perfectly to dosing schedules 
limited treatment options 
most current haart regimens include two nrtis and a protease 
although there are a number of commonly used nrtis  not all of them can be paired together due to cross resistance and drug to drug interactions 
as resistance develops and the efficacy of treatment regimens diminishes over time  patients cycle through different haart regimens  eventually exhausting all the available nrti pairings 
therefore  we believe that there is a continuing need for new compounds from new classes of drugs  including integrase inhibitors 

table of contents hcv polymerase inhibitor our hcv program consists of a series of nucleoside and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
our compounds target nsb  an rna dependent rna polymerase that is a critical enzyme in the lifecycle of hcv 
in vitro studies using a hcv genotype b subgenomic replicon system demonstrate that these nucleoside analogues are among the most potent hcv polymerase inhibitors in development 
market opportunity for the treatment of hcv hcv is the most common chronic blood borne viral infection in the united states and a leading cause of liver failure  liver transplants and liver cancer 
hcv is often found among hemodialysis patients  hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions before hcv is now transmitted primarily through injection drug use and by pregnant women infecting their children in utero 
the world health organization estimates that nearly million people worldwide  or approximately of the world s population  are infected with hcv 
of these individuals  million are chronic hcv carriers with an increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis or liver cancer 
hcv is responsible for more than half of all liver cancer cases and two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world  and it is estimated that three to four million people worldwide are newly infected each year  of whom will develop chronic hepatitis c 
the cdc estimates that approximately million people in the united states are chronically infected with hcv 
because symptoms of this chronic disease do not appear until its later stages  carriers often do not realize they are infected and serve as a source of transmission 
limitations of current therapies for hcv infection the current standard of care for the treatment of hcv infection is a combination of a once weekly injection of pegylated interferon and a twice daily oral administration of ribavirin  an antiviral drug that interferes with viral replication 
pegylated interferon is a modified version of alpha interferon  a protein that occurs naturally in the human body and stimulates the ability of the immune system to fight viral infections 
both pegylated interferon and ribavirin may cause side effects  the most common of which are flu like symptoms  muscle pain  and headache for pegylated interferon  and anemia for ribavirin 
in addition  the fda has required that product labels for pegylated interferon and ribavirin include black box warnings due to their potential to cause serious side effects 
these serious side effects include neuropsychiatric and autoimmune disorders in the case of pegylated interferon  and anemia that may lead to heart attacks in the case of ribavirin 
ribavirin also may cause birth defects or death of the fetus and is therefore not recommended for use in pregnant women 
the side effect profile and week duration of therapy associated with the combination therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin  together with interferon s administration by injection  may reduce patients motivation to initiate or continue hcv therapy under this standard of care 
there are several types  or genotypes  of hcv 
in the united states  hcv genotypes a and b are the two predominant strains of hcv and account for approximately of hcv infections 
unfortunately  less than of treated patients infected with hcv genotypes a and b respond to current standard of care respond with a sustained viral response  or svr  defined as the absence of a detectable amount of the virus in the blood six months after the end of treatment 
despite their limitations  these standard hcv therapies generated worldwide sales of approximately billion in  and are forecasted to increase to more than billion by and billion by there are currently two approaches to inhibiting the activity of the hcv polymerase 
one is the use of nucleoside analogs that mimic the nucleotides normally recognized by the enzyme as it builds a new copy of the viral genome 
these nucleoside analogs take advantage of the fact that the virus can tolerate few mutations in their active sites 
any amino acid changes that might occur which would reduce the ability of the nucleoside analog to bind may also reduce the ability of the polymerase to bind the normal nucleotides 
the other approach involves non nucleoside 
table of contents molecules that can bind to various regions on the polymerase away from the active site 
this type of binding generally prevents the polymerase from assuming the correct configuration and in turn either reduces or prevents its activity 
since these regions can tolerate more changes  many of the differences seen in the genomes of the different variants of hcv can be found in these regions 
the activity of these non nucleoside drugs depends on their ability to bind relatively tightly to specific amino acid sequences and often involves multiple molecular interactions 
if any of these interactions are missing due to a change in the polymerase sequence then binding can not occur properly 
the probability of this happening is much greater with non nucleoside than with nucleoside analogs that act at more conserved sites 
another way of describing this is referred to as the genetic barrier to developing resistance to a drug 
a site of inhibition that is naturally conserved would have a higher genetic barrier than one that is naturally variable or polymorphic 
in response to the limitations of existing treatments for hcv infection  nsb polymerase inhibitors have emerged as a potential complement or alternative to the standard treatment 
unlike interferons  which work by stimulating the immune system s response to viral infection  polymerase inhibitors directly target the virus by inhibiting the nsv polymerase 
accordingly  polymerase inhibitors may significantly improve treatment outcomes  when added to the standard of care in difficult to treat patients  including patients infected with hcv genotypes a and b  relative to treatment with the standard of care alone 
the addition of polymerase inhibitors to the standard of care could also lead to shorter treatment duration  which could increase patient compliance 
it is likely that nsb polymerase inhibitors will initially be used in combination with pegylated interferon  ribavirin  and potentially hcv protease inhibitors  however  it may be possible to eventually to replace the treatment regimen under the current standard of care with a combination of oral therapies directed at hcv  including nsb polymerase inhibitors 
the fda has not yet approved any nsb polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of hcv infection  but several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing product candidates that target the nsb polymerase 
the most advanced nsb polymerase inhibitors are currently in phase ii clinical trials 
cmv we have licensed a series of nucleoside analogues we are developing for the prevention and or treatment of cytomegalovirus virus  or cmv 
cmv is a member of the herpes virus group  which includes the viruses that cause chicken pox  shingles  and herpes 
market opportunity for the treatment of cmv cmv is a virus that most adults carry with them day to day and can remain dormant in the body for long periods of time 
by years of age  between and of adults in the united states will have had an infection caused by cmv 
in most individuals with intact immune systems  cmv causes little or no apparent illness 
however  in immunocompromised individuals  cmv can lead to serious disease or death 
before the availability of potent anti hiv therapy  cmv associated retinitis was commonly seen in aids patients 
currently  patients who are immunosuppressed following hematopoietic stem cell eg  bone marrow or solid organ transplantation remain at very high risk to cmv infection 
in these patients  cmv can lead to severe conditions such as pneumonitis or hepatitis  or to complications such as acute or chronic rejection of a transplanted organ 
there is currently no completely satisfactory treatment for cmv disease  especially in transplant patients 
certain antiviral drugs are effective for the prophylaxis and pre emptive therapy of cmv infection and disease  but are less effective for the treatment of established cmv disease 
further  currently used therapies exhibit significant toxicities and side effects that often limit their use in transplant patients who often have severe co morbidities 
maribavir camvia tm  is a drug candidate currently in phase clinical trials  is being developed by viropharma 
clinical data suggest that maribavir is a potent and selective  orally bioavailable antiviral drug with a unique mechanism of action against cytomegalovirus and may have a more favorable clinical tolerability profile than current therapies 

table of contents we believe that our cmv compounds may have properties that provide for the potential to improve the prevention and treatment of cmv 
preclinical data suggests that the compounds have a novel mechanism of action and good physical properties 
aurexis aurexis is a humanized monoclonal antibody that we had been developing as a first line therapy  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of serious  life threatening staphylococcus aureus  or s 
aureus bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
aurexis targets cifa  an mscramm protein found on the surface of virtually all strains of s 
aureus  including methicillin resistant s 
aureus  or mrsa 
in  we completed a patient phase ii trial of aurexis in patients with confirmed s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
the results suggested that aurexis was generally safe and well tolerated in these patients 
aurexis has been granted fast track designation by the fda for the adjunctive treatment of s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
based upon our strategic focus on antivirals and the lengthy developmental time and resources required to complete a well powered phase ii proof of concept trial of aurexis  we do not intend to allocate any additional development resources to advance the clinical development of aurexis at this time 
we do  however  plan to seek licenses  co development collaborations  or other business arrangements that can provide financial resources and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development of aurexis 
market opportunity for the treatment of s 
aureus infections s 
aureus is one of the leading causes of hospital associated infections 
estimated  s 
aureus infections occur in the united states annually 
we estimate  based on compiled data  that approximately  of these s 
aureus infections are bloodstream infections  also referred to as s 
aureus bacteremia 
we believe that the degree to which the medical community may adopt the use of aurexis  if and when it is approved by the fda  will be based primarily on its ability to reduce the incidence of infection associated mortality  the relapse rate associated with these infections  unresolved secondary site infections  and the number of days that patients with such infections stay in the intensive care unit or hospital 
aurexis clinical trials phase ii 
in may  we reported the results from a patient phase ii trial of aurexis  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of documented s 
aureus bacteremia in hospitalized patients 
patients were randomized to receive antibiotic therapy in combination with either aurexis  at mg kg  or placebo 
both aurexis and the placebo were administered intravenously as a single dose 
in this trial  standard of care antibiotic therapy was selected by the individual investigators 
subjects were followed for days or until early termination from the trial 
the primary objectives of the phase ii trial were to evaluate the safety of a single administration of aurexis  the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of aurexis  and the biological activity of a single dose of aurexis 
favorable trends were observed in the composite primary endpoint of mortality  relapse rate and infection related complications  and a number of secondary endpoints and ad hoc analyses  including the progression in the severity of sepsis  the number of days in the intensive care unit  and the resolution of complications associated with s 
aureus bacteremia 
the phase ii trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate statistically significant differences among the treatment arms in measures of efficacy 
accordingly  these preliminary findings were not statistically significant 
we cannot guarantee that the results of subsequent clinical trials of aurexis will confirm the findings of the phase ii trial 

table of contents phase i 
in may  we reported the completion of an eight patient phase i clinical trial of aurexis to evaluate its safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with end stage renal disease esrd 
based on the pharmacokinetic data from this trial  we intend to include patients with esrd in any follow on trials of aurexis for the treatment of documented s 
aureus bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
staphylococcal vaccine there are a number of patient groups  including approximately  end stage renal disease patients in the united states  patients receiving chronic long term care  and patients undergoing certain elective surgeries  who are at risk of acquiring a staphylococcal infection 
for these high risk groups  we believe an active vaccine that can enhance immunity against staphylococcal organisms may be a less costly and preferred mode of therapy 
we have entered into a license and collaboration agreement with wyeth to develop human vaccines against staphylococcal organisms 
wyeth has initiated preclinical studies of the vaccine candidate 
diagnostic products in january  we entered into a license and commercialization agreement with m company  or m  for the development of certain diagnostic products using our mscramm protein platform 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted m an exclusive global license to use clumping factor a clfa  an mscramm protein  in the development of diagnostic products 
we also granted m a license to use additional mscramm protein targets for the development of other diagnostic products 
in exchange for these licenses  we received an upfront license payment and are entitled to receive future milestone payments  financial support of further research and development activities and royalty payments on product sales 

table of contents our strategy our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops differentiated products that can prevent and treat serious infections 
in order to achieve this goal  we intend to focus on the following strategies advance the development of our current anti viral product candidates 
we plan to focus our resources on the development of our most advanced clinical antiviral compound  fv  for the treatment of shingles  and our three preclinical antiviral development programs hiv integrase inhibitors  nucleoside and non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitors  as well as a series of compounds for the prevention and or treatment of cmv 
in particular  we expect to advance the development of fv through clinical proof of concept  including the initiation of an additional phase i clinical trial evaluating single ascending and multiple ascending doses of fv in healthy volunteers in the first half of  select a lead clinical candidate from our hiv integrase inhibitor program and advance this clinical candidate through phase clinical trials select a lead clinical candidate from our hcv polymerase inhibitor program and advance this clinical candidate through phase clinical trials select a lead clinical compound for the prevention and or treatment of cmv 
leverage or monetize our mscramm platform 
we do not plan to allocate any additional development resources to advance the clinical development of programs based upon our mscramm protein platform  but rather intend to further leverage our capabilities and intellectual property associated with our mscramm protein platform by pursuing licenses  co development  collaborations or other business arrangements that can provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development and potential of these programs  including aurexis 
we also plan to continue to support our existing mscramm based license and collaboration agreements with wyeth for the development of staphylococcal vaccines and m for the development of diagnostic products 
accelerate growth through new collaborations 
we intend to establish new strategic collaborations  partnerships and alliances where we believe we can accelerate the development of our development programs and drug candidates beyond preclinical or clinical proof of concept by utilizing the financial  clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization strengths of a leading pharmaceutical company 
sales and marketing we currently have limited  if any  commercialization capabilities 
at this time  we anticipate partnering or collaborating with other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to advance our antiviral product candidates through late stage clinical development  and if successful  to commercialize our product candidates 
we intend to evaluate whether or not we may independently develop and commercialize any existing or future drug development programs on a case by case basis 
manufacturing we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
we currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required to conduct our clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices  or 
table of contents cgmp  with oversight by our management team 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer for the preclinical or clinical supplies of each of our drug candidates 
however  we believe that there are alternate sources of supply and other contract manufacturers that can produce drug substances and drug products for our preclinical studies and clinical trial requirements without significant delay or material additional costs 
we have used a contract manufacturer  davos chemical company  inc  or davos  to produce clinical trial material for use in the preclinical studies and clinical trials of fv as of december   we have no long term obligations under any of our prior agreements with davos to manufacture additional clinical trial material for our fv program 
competition our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in our industry include  among others  the ability to advance the development of a product candidate through preclinical and clinical trials  the efficacy  toxicological  safety  resistance or cross resistance  and dosing profile of a product or product candidate  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  government reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of products  the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity  manufacturing costs  intellectual property and patent rights and their protection  and sales and marketing capabilities 
if ultimately approved  fv  as well as all of compounds in our antiviral development programs  would all compete against existing therapies or other product candidates in various stages of clinical development  which we believe may become available for the treatment of shingles  hiv  hepatitis c and bacterial infections in the future 
some of the companies that currently market products that would compete with our product candidates include  but are not limited to glaxosmithkline  norvatis and merck in the shingles market  pfizer  merck and gilead in the hiv market  and roche and schering plough in the hepatitis c market 
in addition that are several other competitors developing other early stage drug candidates that may compete with our product candidates in the future 
developing pharmaceutical product candidates is a highly competitive  expensive  time consuming and risky activity 
many organizations  including large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  have substantially more capital resources than we have  and much greater capabilities and experience than we have in basic research and discovery  designing and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  operating in a highly regulated environment  manufacturing drug substance and drug product  marketing and sales 
our competitors may be more successful than we in obtaining fda approval for their product candidates and achieving broad market acceptance once approved 
our competitors drugs may be more effective  have fewer negative side effects  have a favorable drug resistance profile  or be more effectively marketed and sold than any drug we may commercialize 
new competing drug products or new classes of drugs from our competitors may render our drug candidates obsolete or non competitive before we successfully develop our product candidates or  if approved  before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates 
we anticipate that we or our collaborators will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and drug classes enter the market and advanced technologies or drug targets become available 
this may cause us or our collaborators to terminate the development or commercialization of our drug candidates at any time in the future 
a number of our product candidates if approved  particularly fv  will compete directly or indirectly with existing generic drugs  or drugs that will be generic by the time our product candidate might be approved for sale 
generic drugs are drugs whose patent protection has expired  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs protected by intellectually property rights 
unless a patented drug can differentiate itself from a generic drug in a meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication will generally impose significant pricing pressure on competing drugs 
intellectual property rights and patents we own or are have licensed numerous issued united states patents and pending patent applications  as well as corresponding international filings in the fields of our development programs and product candidates 
in addition to our patents and patent applications  we have registered trademarks for inhibitex  fermavir  mscramm  veronate and aurexis 

table of contents patent and other proprietary rights are crucial in our business and for the development of our product candidates 
we have sought  and intend to continue to seek  patent protection for our inventions and rely upon patents  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a competitive advantage 
in order to protect these rights  know how and trade secrets  we typically require employees  consultants  collaborators and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us  generally stating that they will not disclose any confidential information about us to third parties for a certain period of time  and will otherwise not use confidential information for anyone s benefit but ours 
the patent positions of companies like ours involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty 
our issued patents  those licensed to us  and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights granted there under may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possible that  before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized  our relevant patent rights may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization 
expiration of patents we own or license could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology  inventions and improvements we consider important to our product candidates  defend our patents  preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets  and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
we currently own numerous patents and pending patents in the unites states and foreign countries 
we have issued and pending patents with respect to fv the earliest projected expiration date in the united states is approximately we have several issued patents relating to our hiv integrase inhibitors and the earliest projected expiration date for these patents is a related us application is also pending  as are national phase international applications 
also  a pct application is pending 
if the pending patents issue  the earliest projected expiration date in the united states is approximately we have several pending patents with respect to our hcv polymerase inhibitors 
if these pending patents are issued  the earliest projected expiration date in the united states is approximately we have three issued us patents are directed to the clfa protein found on s 
aureus  and antibodies to the protein 
these patents will expire in   and respectively  if not extended 
there are no corresponding foreign rights available for the clfa protein and nucleic acid sequences 
other issued us patents and international counterparts are relates to aurexis and contain claims to monoclonal antibodies recognizing the clfa protein 
the us patent will expire in if not extended 
licensing and collaborations we have entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with wyeth with respect to their use of intellectual property associated with our mscramm proteins to develop human staphylococcal vaccines and a diagnostic license and commercialization agreement with m to develop certain diagnostic products using our mscramm protein platform 
our strategy is to pursue other similar collaborations or partnerships in the future with companies that may utilize our intellectual property in their products  or develop  co develop  market and sell our product candidates 

table of contents wyeth in august  we entered into a license and development collaboration agreement with wyeth for the development of human staphylococcal vaccines 
under the terms of this agreement  we granted wyeth an exclusive worldwide license to our mscramm protein intellectual property with respect to human vaccines against staphylococcal organisms 
the development  manufacture and sale of any products resulting from the collaboration will be the responsibility of wyeth

the maximum milestone payments we could receive with respect to all licensed products are million 
finally  we are also entitled to royalties on net sales of licensed products manufactured  sold or distributed by wyeth 
m company in january  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and commercialization agreement with m for the development of various diagnostic products using our mscramm protein platform 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted m exclusive global licenses to use mscramm protein intellectual property in the development of diagnostic products in exchange for license fees  future milestone payments  financial support of future research and development activities and royalty payments on net product sales 
the development  manufacture and sale of any products resulting from the collaboration are the responsibility of m

in addition a tiered royalty based on net sales of diagnostic products  and reimbursement of certain patent expenses related to licensed mscramm proteins 
we are obligated to provide support to m pursuant to a mutually agreed upon development and collaboration plan for a period of at least two years 
other licensing agreements in september  we completed the acquisition of fermavir 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired the rights to a worldwide royalty bearing license from cardiff university in wales  united kingdom  which includes fv  a nucleoside analogue for the treatment of vzv infections and a series of preclinical nucleoside analogues for the treatment of cytomegalovirus  or cmv 
the license agreement calls for us to make certain contingent milestone payments and a royalty on the sale of any products that utilize the underlying technology 
we may terminate this agreement upon days notice 
in september  we obtained an exclusive royalty bearing worldwide license from the university of georgia

pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement in the united states and most foreign markets  any revenue associated with our products will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers 
third party payers include various government health authorities such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  which administers medicare and medicaid in the united states  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services  including pharmaceuticals 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
our products may ultimately not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to support a profitable operation or generate an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
the united states and foreign governments periodically propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before any of our product candidates are ever approved for marketing 
adoption of new legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
the marketability of our products may suffer if the government and other third party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our product candidates 
we or our collaborators intend to obtain coverage and reimbursement from these third party payers for any of our products that may be approved for sale  however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining adequate coverage  reimbursement  or pricing  if any 
regulatory matters overview the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  distribution  promotion  sale and export  reporting and record keeping of drug product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states  principally the fda and corresponding state agencies  and regulatory agencies in foreign countries 
non compliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of the clinical development of a drug candidate  product manufacturing and marketing  failure of the 
table of contents government to grant marketing approval  withdrawal of marketing approvals  fines  injunctions  seizure of products and criminal prosecution 
united states regulatory approval pursuant to fda regulations  we are required to undertake a long and rigorous development process before any of our product candidates may be marketed or sold in the united states 
this regulatory process typically includes the following general steps the completion of satisfactory preclinical laboratory and animal studies under the fda s good laboratory practices regulation  the submission and acceptance of an ind that must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  obtaining the approval of institutional review boards  or irbs  at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials  the successful completion of a series of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety  purity  potency and efficacy of any product candidate for its intended use  which conform to the fda s good clinical practice regulations  the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes that conform to fda mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  and the submission to  and review and approval by  the fda of a new drug application  or nda  or for biologic pharmaceutical products  a biologics license application  or bla  prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product 
successfully completing this development process requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources 
we cannot assure you or be certain that this process will result in the granting of an approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
preclinical studies preclinical studies generally include laboratory  or in vitro evaluation of a product candidate  its chemistry  formulation  stability and toxicity  as well as certain animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy 
we must submit the results of these preclinical studies  together with manufacturing information  analytical data and the clinical trial protocol  to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before we may begin any human clinical trials 
an ind automatically becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within this day time period  raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold 
if one or more of our product candidates is placed on clinical hold  we would be required to resolve any outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the fda before we could begin  or continue  clinical trials 
preclinical studies generally take years or months to complete  and there is no guarantee that an ind based on those studies will become effective  allowing human clinical testing to begin 
in addition to fda review of an ind  each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the clinical protocol reviewed and approved by an independent irb 
the irb considers  among other things  ethical factors  and the selection and safety of human subjects 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s good clinical practices requirements 
certain preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the fda s good laboratory practice  or glp regulations and the united states department of agriculture s animal welfare act 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of the studies  requiring such studies to be conducted again 

table of contents clinical trials the clinical phase of development follows a successful ind submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate safety  tolerability  efficacy and dosage of the substance in humans  as well as the ability to produce the substance and finished drug product in accordance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  requirements 
clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing  among other things  the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the efficacy of the drug 
each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind prior to beginning the trial 
each trial must be reviewed  approved and conducted under the auspices of an irb  and each trial  with limited exceptions  must include the patient s informed consent 
sponsors  investigators  and irbs also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice  or gcp  including regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects  complying with the protocol and investigational plan  adequately monitoring the clinical trial  and reporting adverse events timely 
the fda  the irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
foreign studies performed under an ind must meet the same requirements that apply to studies conducted in the united states 
the fda may accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an ind only if the study is well designed  well conducted  performed by qualified investigators  and conforms to the ethical principles contained in the declaration of helsinki  or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted  whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects 
clinical trials to support an nda or bla for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases  phases i  ii and iii  with phase iv clinical trials conducted after marketing approval has been received 
fda may require sponsors to conduct phase iv clinical trials to study certain safety issues 
data from these activities are compiled in an nda or a bla for submission to the fda requesting approval to market the drug 
these phases may be compressed  may overlap  or may be omitted in some circumstances 
phase i after an ind becomes effective  phase i human clinical trials can begin 
a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used 
generally the main purpose of a phase i trial is to assess a product candidate s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate the product candidate 
absorption  metabolism  distribution and pharmacokinetic trials are also generally performed at this stage 
phase i trials typically evaluate these aspects of the investigational drug in both single doses as well as multiple doses 
phase ii during phase ii trials  a product candidate is generally studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to i further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks  ii assess the preliminary or potential efficacy or biologic activity of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions  and iii assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for a subsequent phase ii or phase iii trial 
phase ii trials generally involve patients who are divided into one or more groups that will get one of several dose levels of the product candidate  and a control group that will not be treated with the product candidate and may receive a placebo 
in some cases  a sponsor may decide to run what is referred to as a phase iib evaluation  which is a second  confirmatory phase ii clinical trial 
phase iii if and when one or more phase ii trials demonstrate that a specific dose or range of doses of a product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile  one or more phase iii trials are generally undertaken to further demonstrate or confirm clinical efficacy and to further evaluate the safety of the investigational drug in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating its overall risk benefit relationship 
phase iii trials will generally be designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint  the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate s potential clinical efficacy 
the successful demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in one or more phase iii trials is typically a prerequisite to the filing of a nda or bla for a product candidate 
in the case of product candidates being developed for life threatening diseases  such as hiv and hcv  the initial 
table of contents phase i human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease rather than in healthy volunteers 
these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in phase ii clinical trials  and so these trials are frequently referred to as phase i ii clinical trials 
in addition  a company may hold an end of phase ii meeting with the fda to assess the safety of the drug regimen to be tested in the phase iii clinical trial  to evaluate the phase iii plan  and to identify any additional information that will be needed to support an nda 
if the phase iii clinical trials had been the subject of discussion at an end of phase meeting  the company is eligible for a special protocol assessment  or spa  by the fda  a process by which the fda  at the request of the sponsor  will evaluate the trial protocol and issues relating to the protocol within days to assess whether it is adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor 
if the fda and the sponsor reach agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an nda  the fda will reduce the understanding to writing 
the spa  however  is not a guarantee of product approval by fda or approval of any permissible claims about the product 
throughout the clinical phase  samples of the product made in different batches are tested for stability to establish shelf life constraints 
in addition  large scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed 
phase i  ii  and iii testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted under an ind and may  at its discretion  reevaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate further evaluation or trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the patient 
the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval 
additionally  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 
furthermore  irbs  which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects in the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted  have the authority to suspend clinical trials in their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons  including safety issues 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully complete any phase i  phase ii or phase iii trials of our product candidates within any specific time period  if at all 
furthermore  we  the fda  an irb  or a data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk 
certain information about clinical trials  including a description of the study  participation criteria  location of study sites  and contact information  shall be sent to the national institutes of health nih for inclusion in a publicly accessable database that is available at www 
clinicaltrials 
gov 
sponsors also are subject to certain state laws imposing requirements to make publicly available certain information on clinical trial results 
in addition  the food and drug administration amendments act of directs the fda to issue regulations that will require sponsors to submit to the nih the results of all controlled clinical studies  other than phase i studies 
new drug and biologics license applications if and when our human clinical trials are completed with satisfactory clinical data  we must submit a nda or bla to the fda in order to obtain approval for the marketing and sale of a product candidate 
among many other items  a nda or bla typically includes the results of preclinical and toxicology studies and human clinical trials and a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods 
the fda must approve the nda or bla prior to the marketing and sale of the related product 
the fda may deny a nda or bla if all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional data  including clinical  toxicology  safety or manufacturing data 
the fda has days from its receipt of the nda or bla to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before accepting it for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept a nda or bla for filing 
in this event  the nda or bla must be resubmitted with the additional information 
the fda may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee  typically a panel that includes clinicians 
table of contents and other experts  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
a nda or bla can receive either standard or priority review 
a drug candidate representing a potential significant improvement in the treatment  prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review 
in addition  product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity 
as a condition of approval  the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post marketing phase iv clinical trials 
priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval  but may expedite the approval process 
if the fda evaluation of the nda or bla and inspection of manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue an approval letter or an approvable letter 
an approvable letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda or bla 
if and when those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will typically issue an approval letter 
an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication 
as a condition of nda or bla approval  the fda may require post approval testing  including phase iv trials  and surveillance to monitor the drug s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions  including labeling or distribution restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug 
once granted  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
if the fda s evaluation of the nda or bla submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda may refuse to approve the nda or bla and issue a not approvable letter 
the not approvable letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and often requires additional testing or information in order for the fda to reconsider the application 
even after submitting this additional information  the fda ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval 
with limited exceptions  the fda may withhold approval of a nda regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor 
it can take several years for the fda to approve a nda or bla once it is submitted  and the actual time required for any product candidate may vary substantially  depending upon the nature  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
we cannot be certain that the fda  or any other similar regulatory agency in other countries  will grant approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
even if such regulatory approval is granted  additional post marketing  or clinical trials  may be required that would add additional product development costs beyond those incurred through phase iii testing 
the fda generally requires products with fast track status  such as aurexis  to be further evaluated for safety in additional clinical trials 
post approval regulations if and when a product candidate receives regulatory approval  the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  subsequent discovery of previously unknown safety problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use  or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
any fda approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences 
further  drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and state agencies for compliance with cgmp  which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers 
we cannot be certain 
table of contents that we  or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers  will be able to comply with cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of production activities  failure of the fda to grant approval for marketing  and withdrawal  suspension  or revocation of marketing approvals 
if the fda approves one or more of our product candidates  we or our collaborators and our contract manufacturers must provide the fda with certain updated safety  efficacy and manufacturing information 
product changes  as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post approval changes may necessitate additional fda review and approval 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the production and manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
the labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product must also comply with fda and federal trade commission  or ftc  requirements which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda and ftc have very broad enforcement authority  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures  fines  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
the fda s policies may change in the future and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
moreover  increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the united states and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad  or the impact such changes could have on our business 
once an approval is granted  the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and in some circumstances the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post marketing programs 
from time to time  legislation is drafted  introduced and passed in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval  manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the fda 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted  or fda regulations  guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
fast track drug status the fda has developed fast track policies  which provide for the potential for expedited review of a nda or bla 
however  there is no assurance that the fda will  in fact  accelerate the review process for a fast track product candidate 
fast track status is provided only for those new and novel therapies that are intended to treat persons with life threatening and severely debilitating diseases where there is a defined unmet medical need  especially where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or the new therapy is significantly superior to alternative therapies 
during the development of product candidates that qualify for this status  the fda may expedite consultations and reviews of these experimental therapies 
fast track status also provides for the potential for a priority review  whereby the fda agrees to reduce the time it takes to review a nda or bla 
the fda can base approval of a marketing application for a fast track product on a clinical endpoint or on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 
the fda generally requires as a condition of the approval of an 
table of contents application for certain fast track products  additional post approval studies or phase iv clinical studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint 
further  fast track status allows for a rolling nda or bla submission  whereby portions of the application can be submitted to the fda for review prior to the completion of the entire application 
a rolling submission could result in a reduction in the length of time it would otherwise take the fda to complete its review of the application 
fast track status may be revoked by the fda at any time if the clinical results of a trial fail to continue to support the assertion that the respective product candidate has the potential to address an unmet medical need 
in addition fast track status may be granted for a specific application of a drug candidate 
foreign regulatory approval outside of the united states  our ability to market any of our existing or future product candidates will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities whether or not fda approval has been obtained 
the foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally includes risks that are similar to the fda approval process described herein 
the requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations  and the time required to obtain requisite approvals may vary widely from country to country and differ from that required for fda approval 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure  which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for a member state  known as the reference member state  to assess an application  with one or more other member states subsequently approving that assessment 
under this procedure  an applicant submits an application  or dossier  and related materials  including a draft summary of product characteristics  draft labeling and package leaflet  to the reference member state and concerned member states 
the reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within days after receipt of a valid application 
within days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report  each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials 
if a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health  the disputed points may eventually be referred to the european commission  whose decision is binding on all member states

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks  together with the other information contained in this form k 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business  our financial condition  and our ability to raise additional capital in the future or ever become profitable 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
risks relating to our development of our product candidates all of our product candidates are still in the early stages of development and remain subject to numerous preclinical studies  clinical testing and regulatory approval 
if we are unable to successfully develop our product candidates  our business will be materially harmed 
our failure to successfully develop one or more of our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on us  and possibly cause us to cease operations 
to date  we have not commercially marketed  distributed or sold any product candidates 
the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop our product candidates through early stages of development and ultimately later commercialize our product candidates successfully 
we plan to initiate a phase i clinical trial evaluating single and multiple ascending doses of fv in healthy volunteers in the first half of we also plan to select a lead clinical candidate for our hiv integrase and hcv polymerase inhibitor programs in we are also currently screening a number of the hcv and cmv compounds for potency and cytoxicity to determine whether one or more of these can serve as a lead clinical candidate 
our product candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale 
to satisfy these standards  we must engage in expensive and lengthy preclinical studies and clinical testing and obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates 
despite our efforts  our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other benefits over existing  comparable drugs  be proven safe and effective in clinical trials  have the desired effects or may include undesirable effects or the drug candidates may have other unexpected characteristics  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully commercialized by us or by partners 
even if we achieve success in earlier stage clinical trials as we did with veronate  there can be no assurance that later stage trials will be successful 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early trials 
accordingly  the results from our programs that have completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage trials 
our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts  substantial financial resources  and regulatory approvals prior to advancing into further clinical development or being commercialized by us or collaborators 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will successfully progress through the drug development process or will result in clinically or commercially viable products 
we do not expect any of our drug candidates to be commercially available to us or collaborators for at least several years 
if we are unable to successfully develop our product candidates  our business will be materially harmed 

table of contents if preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates  including those that are subject to collaboration agreements  are unsuccessful or delayed  we could be delayed or precluded from further developing or ultimately commercialization of our product candidates 
in order to further advance the development of and ultimately receive regulatory approval to sell our product candidates  we must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda or other regulatory authorities 
preclinical studies and clinical testing are expensive  complex  may take many years to complete  and its outcome is highly uncertain 
delays  setbacks or failures may occur at any time  or in any phase of preclinical studies or clinical development process for a number of reasons  including concerns about safety or toxicity  a lack of demonstrated efficacy or superior efficacy over other similar products that have been approved for sale or are in more advanced stages of development  poor trial design  and issues related to the manufacturing process of the materials used to conduct the clinical trials 
the results of preclinical studies and prior clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results we may see in later stage clinical trials 
in many cases  product candidates in clinical development may fail to show desired safety and efficacy traits despite having successfully demonstrated so in preclinical studies or earlier stage clinical trials 
in addition  we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  preclinical studies and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our drug candidates  including regulators or irbs may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site  enrollment in our clinical trials may be delayed or proceed at a slower place than we expected or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipated  resulting in significant delays  our third party contractors whom we rely on for conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner  we might have to suspend or ultimately terminate our clinical trials if participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  irbs or regulators may require that we hold  suspend or terminate preclinical studies or clinical trials for various reasons  including noncompliance with regulatory requirements  and the supply or quality of our product candidates necessary to conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate 
even if the data collected from preclinical studies or clinical trials involving our product candidates satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy  such results may not be sufficient to support the submission of an ind application to support the initiation of clinical trials in humans or a nda  or bla to obtain regulatory approval from the fda in the united states  to sell the product 
we must comply with extensive government regulations in order to advance our product candidates through the clinical development process and ultimately obtain and maintain marketing approval for our products in the united states and abroad 
our product candidates and any products for which we receive fda approval to advance through clinical development and ultimately sell are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic and foreign government regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
our product candidates are also subject to similarly extensive regulation by foreign governments to the extent we seek to develop them in those countries 
we or our collaborators must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  if applicable  with preclinical and clinical data that appropriately demonstrate our product candidates safety and efficacy before they can be approved for the targeted indications 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market  and we cannot predict whether we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate we are developing or plan to develop 
the regulatory review and approval process can take many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity  novelty of  and medical need for the product  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and vigilance  and generally involves ongoing requirements for post marketing studies or phase iv clinical trials 
in addition  we or our collaborators may encounter delays in or fail to gain regulatory approval for our product candidates based upon additional governmental regulation resulting from future legislative or administrative action or changes in fda policy or interpretation during the period of product development 
delays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval to advance our product candidates through clinical development and ultimately commercialize them may 
table of contents adversely affect the ability to further develop or commercialize any of our product candidates  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborators may have or attain  and adversely affect the receipt of milestones payments and royalties from the sale of our products or product revenues 
furthermore  any regulatory approvals  if granted  may later be withdrawn 
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time  or if post approval safety concerns arise  we or our collaborators may be subject to restrictions or a number of actions  including delays  suspension or termination of the clinical trials related to our products  refusal by the fda to review pending applications or supplements to approved applications  product recalls or seizures  suspension of manufacturing  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
additionally  we or our collaborators may voluntarily halt the development of any product candidate or withdraw any approved product from the market if we believe that it may pose an unacceptable safety risk to patients  or if the product candidate or approved product no longer meets our business objectives 
the ability to develop or market a pharmaceutical product outside of the united states is contingent upon receiving appropriate authorization from the respective foreign regulatory authorities 
foreign regulatory approval processes typically include many  if not all  of the risks associated with the fda as described above and may include additional risks 
we have limited experience in the development of antiviral product candidates and therefore may encounter difficulties developing our product candidates or managing our operations in the future 
we recently acquired or licensed several antiviral drug development programs that are based upon chemical compounds  also referred to as small molecules 
historically  we have focused our resources on the development and commercialization of antibody based product candidates  which are composed of biologic materials and are generally considered to be large molecules 
therefore  we have limited experience in the discovery  development and manufacturing of antiviral small molecule compounds 
in order to successfully develop our antiviral pipeline and manage this shift in operational focus  we have begun to expand and supplement our research  clinical development  regulatory  medicinal chemistry  virology and manufacturing functions through the addition of key employees  consultants or third party contractors to provide certain capabilities and skill sets that we currently do not possess  including but not limited to virology  medicinal chemistry  drug formulation and pharmacology 
we cannot assure you that we will attract or retain such qualified employees  consultants or third party contractors with the appropriate antiviral small molecule drug development experience 
in the event we cannot attract such capabilities or successfully develop our antiviral pipeline or manage these operational changes  our business will be materially harmed 
in order to develop our product candidates  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future  and the timing and extent of this need will depend on many factors  some of which are very difficult to predict and others that are beyond our control  including our ability to successfully advance the development of our drug candidates and programs  most of which we have recently obtained  
table of contents the time and cost to complete the requisite preclinical studies and clinical trials and receive regulatory approval to advance our product candidates through the various phases of clinical development  the amount of future payments  if any  received or made under existing or future license  collaboration or similar arrangements  the costs associated with protecting or expanding our patent and other intellectual property rights  and whether we acquire licenses to new products  development programs or compounds in the future through in licensing  acquisition or merger  and the stage of development of any such development programs 
if any of our product development efforts are successful  we may receive licensing fees  milestone payments and royalties pursuant to licensing and collaboration agreements we may enter into  which could lessen the need for additional capital  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product development efforts or that we will be able to enter such agreements 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  together with proceeds we expect to receive from existing license and collaboration agreements will enable us to operate for a period of at least months from the date of this filing 
we have no other committed sources of additional capital at this time 
we cannot assure you that funds will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us at all or  on terms that we find acceptable we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate research and development efforts or clinical trials on any or all of our product candidates 
we may also be forced to curtail or restructure our operations  obtain funds by entering into arrangements with licensees  collaborators or partners on unattractive terms  or sell or relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or our intellectual property that we would not otherwise sell or relinquish in order to continue our operations 
if we are unable to retain or  in the future  attract key employees  advisors or consultants  we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates or otherwise manage our business effectively 
our success depends in part on our ability to retain qualified management and personnel  directors and academic scientists and clinicians as advisors or consultants 
we are currently highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
in order to develop our preclinical and clinical stage development programs  we will need to attract and retain personnel with experience in a number of disciplines  including research and development  clinical testing  government regulation of pharmaceuticals  manufacturing and chemistry  business development  accounting  finance  human resources and information systems 
although we have not had material difficulties in retaining and attracting key personnel in the past  we may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel in the future on acceptable terms due to our limited financial resources  if at all 
if we lose any key employees  or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  advisors or consultants  our business may be harmed 
if third party vendors upon whom we rely to conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials do not perform or fail to comply with strict regulations  the clinical trials for our product candidates may be terminated  delayed  or fail 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we have historically relied and intend to continue to rely on third parties  including clinical research organizations  consultants and principal investigators  to assist us in managing  monitoring and conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we rely on these vendors and individuals to perform many facets of the development process  including ind enabling studies  the recruitment of sites and patients for participation in our clinical trials  to maintain positive relations with the clinical sites and to ensure that these sites are conducting our trials in compliance with the protocol  our instructions and applicable regulations 
if these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily or do not adequately fulfill their obligations under the terms of our agreements with them  we may not be able to enter into 
table of contents alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures  and therefore the pre clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed or prove unsuccessful 
further  the fda may inspect some of the clinical sites participating in our clinical trials  or our third party vendors sites  to determine if our clinical trials are being conducted according to current good clinical practices 
if we or the fda determine that our third party vendors are not in compliance with  or have not conducted our clinical trials according to applicable regulations  we may be forced to delay  repeat or terminate such clinical trials 
any delay  repetition or termination of our pre clinical studies and clinical trials could be very costly  result in the elimination of a development program  and materially harm our business 
if third party contract manufacturers  upon whom we rely to manufacture our product candidates do not perform  fail to manufacture according to our specifications  or fail to comply with strict regulations  our preclinical studies or clinical trials and the development of our product candidates could be terminated  delayed  or adversely affected 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
we have historically contracted with third party manufacturers to produce the preclinical and clinical trial materials we use to test our product candidates in development  and we intend to continue to rely on third party contract manufacturers  at least for the foreseeable future  to manufacture these preclinical and clinical trial materials 
our reliance on third party contract manufacturers exposes us to a number of risks  any of which could delay or prevent the completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials  the regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues 
some of these risks include the manufacture of products requires compliance with numerous and strict safety  quality and regulatory standards 
our contract manufacturers may not produce our product candidates according to their own standards  our specifications  current good manufacturing procedures  or cgmp  or may otherwise manufacture material that we or the fda may deem to be unusable in our clinical trials  our contract manufacturers may be unable to increase the scale of  or increase the capacity for  our product candidates  we may experience a shortage in supply  or the cost to manufacture our products may increase to the point where it adversely affects the cost of our products 
we cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture our products at a suitable scale  or we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so  our third party contract manufacturers may place a priority on the manufacture of their own products  or other customers products  our contract manufacturers may fail to perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business  our manufacturers plants may be closed as a result of regulatory sanctions or a natural disaster 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda  the united states drug enforcement administration  or dea  and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with fda mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we are obligated to audit their performance  we do not have control over our third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
failure by our third party manufacturers  or us  to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the drug manufacturer from the production of other third party products 
these sanctions include fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of the government to grant pre market approval of drugs  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  seizures or recalls of product  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
in the event that we need to change our third party contract manufacturers  our preclinical studies  clinical trials and the development of our products could be delayed  adversely affected or terminated or result in higher costs 
due to regulatory restrictions inherent in an ind  nda or bla  the manufacture of our product candidates may be 
table of contents sole sourced 
in accordance with cgmps  changing manufacturers may require the re validation of the manufacturing processes and procedures and may require further preclinical studies or clinical trials 
changing our current or future contract manufacturers may be difficult for us and could be costly and take years to complete  which could result in our inability to manufacture our products or product candidates for an extended period of time or possibly additional clinical trials 
our product candidates may have undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other products that may prevent their regulatory approval or limit their use if approved 
we must demonstrate the safety of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approval to advance their clinical development or to market them 
in preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted to date our product candidates have been generally been well tolerated  however these studies and trials involved a small number of subjects 
we may observe adverse or significant adverse events in future preclinical studies or clinical trials of these product candidates in the future 
any side effects associated with our product candidates in development may outweigh their potential benefit and result in the termination the development program  prevent regulatory approval or limit their market acceptance if they are approved 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully or develop innovative products  which could harm our business 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about genetics and develop new technologies and scientific approaches to treating and preventing disease 
our current and potential competitors generally include  among others  major multi national pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
some of the companies that currently market products that would compete with our product candidates include  but are not limited to glaxosmithkline  norvatis and merck in the shingles market  pfizer  merck and gilead in the hiv market  and roche and schering plough in the hepatitis c market 
in addition there are several other competitors developing other early stage drug candidates that may compete with our product candidates in the future 
most of these companies and institutions  either alone or together with their collaborators  have substantially greater financial or corporate resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborators  have significantly greater experience than we do in discovering  developing  manufacturing and marketing products  particularly those based upon small molecules 
future developments by others may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we also face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  for attracting investigators and sites capable of conducting our clinical trials and for licenses of proprietary technology 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborators  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective  less expensive or easier to administer than ours 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we can 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commercialize their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that could delay the ability of competitors to market certain products 
we cannot assure you that product candidates resulting from our research and development efforts  or from joint efforts with our collaborators  will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development 
we have experienced losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur such losses for the foreseeable future and we may never become profitable 
since inception may  through december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from costs related to our research programs and the clinical development of our product candidates  and general and administrative costs relating to our operations 

table of contents we anticipate incurring losses for the foreseeable future if we further develop our product candidates  which will generally require us to conduct significant research and laboratory testing  conduct extensive and expensive clinical trials  and seek regulatory approvals 
we cannot assure you that we will ever generate direct or royalty revenue from the sale of products or ever become profitable 
based on our current strategy  our quarterly and annual operating costs and revenues may become highly volatile  and comparisons to previous periods will be difficult 
our revenues  expenses and results of operations will be subject to significant fluctuations  which will make it difficult to compare our operating results from period to period 
until we have successfully developed a product candidate  we expect that substantially all of our revenue will result from payments we receive under collaborative arrangements or license agreements where we grant others the right to use our intellectual property or know how 
we may not be able to generate additional revenues under existing or future collaborative agreements 
furthermore  payments potentially due to us under our existing and any future collaborative arrangements  including any milestone and up front payments  are intermittent in nature and are subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount  or may never be earned or paid 
further some of our collaboration arrangements allow our partner to terminate the agreement on relatively short notice 
therefore  our historical and current revenues may not be indicative of our ability to achieve additional payment generating milestones in the future 
we expect that our operating results will also vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of newly entered into in licensing agreements and the acquisition of fermavir  our re focused research and development efforts  the execution or termination of collaborative arrangements  the initiation  success or failure of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of the manufacture of our product candidates or other development related factors 
accordingly  our revenues and results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the revenues or results of operations for any other period 
we do not have drug discovery capabilities  and therefore we are dependent on third parties to discover additional product candidates for our pipeline 
we have relied and will continue to rely on third parties to discover new product candidates through sponsored research or in licensing 
we will face substantial competition for in licensing or sponsored research opportunities from others  many of which may have greater resources then we have 
additional  opportunities may not be available to us  or if available  the terms may not be acceptable 
in addition many compounds that appear promising in early preclinical studies fail to progress to become lead product candidates or ever advance into clinical trials 
our research and development efforts may not lead to the discovery of any additional product candidates that would be suitable for further preclinical or clinical development 
the discovery of additional product candidates requires significant time  research and preclinical studies  as well as a substantial commitment of resources 
there is a great deal of uncertainty inherent in our research efforts and  as a consequence  our ability to fill our product pipeline with new additional product candidates may not be successful 
the requirements of being a publicly traded company may strain our corporate infrastructure and increase our overall operating costs 
the obligations associated with being a publicly traded company require significant additional expenditures and place additional demands on our management  administrative  operational  and finance resources as we comply with the reporting requirements of a public company 
if we are unable to accomplish our objectives in a timely and effective manner  our ability to comply with the rules that apply to public companies could be impaired and ultimately affect our business 
we will continue to incur or may have substantial increases in our expenses as a result of being a public company 
as a publicly traded company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act of and the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market llc 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  which is expensive and requires the attention of our limited management resources 

table of contents if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us for uninsured liabilities or such claim exceeds our insurance coverage  we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards 
the use of any of our existing or future product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products may expose us to product liability claims 
we currently have product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of million 
in the event any of our product candidates is approved for sale by the fda and commercialized  we may need to increase our product liability coverage 
such insurance coverage may not protect us against any or all of the product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain adequate insurance coverage at a commercially reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses 
in the event a product liability claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
defending any product liability claim or claims could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
if our use of hazardous materials results in contamination or injury  we could suffer significant financial loss 
our research and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and medical waste 
notwithstanding the regulations controlling the use of these materials and the safety procedures we undertake  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge or exposure  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  which may exceed our financial resources 
risks relating to the commercialization of our product candidates we may delay or terminate the development of a product candidate if the perceived market and commercial opportunity does not justify further investment  which could materially harm our business 
even though the results of preclinical and clinical studies and trials may support further development of one or more of our drug candidates  we may delay or terminate the future development of a drug candidate at any time for strategic  business  or financial reasons  including the determination that the emerging profile of the drug candidate is such that it may not gain meaningful acceptance or otherwise provide any competitive advantages in its intended indication or market 
if the actual or perceived therapeutic benefits of fv are not different from competing generic drugs  we may terminate the development of fv  or our ability to generate significant revenue may be limited and our potential profitability could be harmed 
valtrex  famvir and zovirax are existing drugs use to treat shingles patients 
zovirax is a generic drug and valtrex and famvir will both be generic drugs by accordingly  if fv doesn t offer significant therapeutic benefits over these existing comparable drugs  including the incidence  severity and duration of shingles  reduction of phn  more convenient dosing schedules and avoidance of adverse effects in renal function patients then we terminate or delay the future development of a fv at any time 
there can be assurance that later stage clinical trials will provide therapeutic benefits over existing therapies  as perceived in our early stage preclinical studies and clinical trials 
if we fail to enter into collaborations to commercialize our product candidates  or sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties  or otherwise establish marketing and sales capabilities  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products 

table of contents we currently have no infrastructure to support the commercialization of any of our product candidates  and have little  if any  experience in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to access or develop a capable sales force and suitable marketing capabilities in a timely manner 
we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with other companies to commercialize some or all of our products in north america and in other countries around the world 
to the extent that we enter into license and collaboration agreements  or marketing and sales arrangements with other companies to sell  promote or market our products in the united states or abroad  our product revenues  which may be in the form of indirect revenue  a royalty  or a split of profits  will depend on their efforts  which may not be successful 
the development of third party or internal sales force and marketing capabilities will result in us incurring significant costs before the time that we may generate significant revenues 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified third parties or marketing or sales personnel  or be able to establish an effective sales force 
we may be unable to successfully develop product candidates that are the subject of collaborations if our collaborators do not perform  terminate our agreements  or delay the development of our product candidates 
we have in the past and expect to continue to enter into and rely on collaborations or other business arrangements with third parties to develop and or commercialize our existing and future product candidates 
such collaborators or partners may not perform as agreed  fail to comply with strict regulations or elect to delay or terminate their efforts in developing or commercializing our product candidates  even though we have performed our obligations under the arrangement 
we cannot assure you that any product candidates will emerge from our relationships with wyeth or m company or any other new collaboration we may enter into in the future related to any of our other product candidates 
if government and third party payers fail to provide adequate reimbursement or coverage for our products or those we develop through collaborations  our revenues and potential for profitability will be harmed 
in the united states and most foreign markets  our product revenues and the inherent value of our product candidates and products will depend largely upon the reimbursement rates established by third party payers for such product candidates or products 
such third party payers include government health administration authorities  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status  if any  of newly approved drugs or pharmaceutical products 
we may need to conduct post marketing clinical trials in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products 
such studies may require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources 
we cannot assure you that our products will be reimbursed in part  or at all  by any third party payers 
domestic and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare  including pharmaceutical drugs 
in some foreign markets  governments control prescription drugs pricing and profitability 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put downward pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any of our products in the future  which would limit our revenues and profitability 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceutical products may change before our product candidates are approved for sale  which could further limit or eliminate reimbursement rates for our products 
if any products that we develop independently or through collaborations are approved but do not gain meaningful acceptance in their intended markets  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
even if our product candidates are successfully developed and we or a partner or collaborator obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to sell our products in the future  they may not gain market acceptance or utilization among physicians and patients 
the degree of market acceptance for any of our product candidates that may be commercialized will depend on a number of factors  including 
table of contents the therapeutic efficacy or perceived benefit of the product  the level of reimbursement available to cover the cost of the product  the cost of the product to the user or payer  the product s potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies  the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products  the effectiveness of sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the scope of the product label approved by the fda 
there can be no assurance that physicians will choose to administer our products to the intended patient population 
if our products do not achieve meaningful market acceptance  or if the market for our products proves to be smaller than anticipated  we may not generate significant revenues or ever become profitable 
even if our collaborator or we achieve market acceptance for our product candidates  we may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our drugs because of generic competition and social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs to treat hiv and hcv 
several fda approved products are already available in generic form or face patent expiration in the next several years in the markets and indications we are pursuing  including therapies for the treatment of shingles and hiv 
we expect to face competition from these generic drugs  including significant price based competition 
further  pressure from aids awareness and other social activist groups whose goal it is to reduce hiv drug prices  particularly in less developed nations  may also put downward pressure on the prices of hiv drugs  including our integrase program 
similar trends of generic competition or social or political pressure may occur for our hcv program  which would result in downward pressure on prices 
if conflicts arise between our collaborators and us  our collaborators may act in their best interest and not in our best interest  which could adversely affect our business 
conflicts may arise with our collaborators if they pursue alternative therapies for the same diseases that are targeted by intellectual property rights we have licensed to them 
competing products  either developed by our existing or future collaborators  may result in development delays or the withdrawal of their support for our product candidates 
additionally  conflicts may arise if there is a dispute about the progress of  or other activities related to  the clinical development of a product candidate  the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the course of the collaborative arrangement 
similarly  we may disagree with a collaborator as to which party owns newly developed products 
should an agreement be terminated as a result of a dispute and before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration  we may not be able to obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving 
if patent applications that we  or our licensors  have filed or may file in the future with respect to our development programs are not issued or the claims are restricted  our business prospects could be harmed 
many patents which we expect to rely upon to protect our intellectual property rights  particularly with respect to our antiviral drug development programs  have been filed but not yet issued 
these pending patent applications  or those we may file or license from third parties in the future  may not result in patents being issued 
further  until a patent is issued  any or all claims covered by the patent may be narrowed or removed entirely  and therefore we may ultimately not obtain adequate patent protection 
as a result  we may conclude that without certain patent rights  the risk and cost of further developing and commercializing certain product candidates is too great  thus adversely affecting our business prospects 
if we are unable to adequately protect or expand our intellectual property  our business prospects could be harmed 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights and patents  or rights to intellectual property and patents  and maintain their validity  protect our trade secrets  and 
table of contents prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights or patents 
we will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of drug and biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to ultimately enforce our patents or proprietary rights 
therefore  any issued patents that we own or have rights to may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and may not provide us with the protection against competitors that we anticipate 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary intellectual property rights is uncertain because issued patents and other legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage 
for example we  or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or our licensors pending patent applications and issued patents  and we may have to engage in expensive and protracted interference proceedings to determine priority of invention  our  or our licensors pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  our  or our licensors issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties  third parties may design around our or our licensors patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside the scope of our or our licensors patents  or because of the extensive time required for the development  testing and regulatory review of a product candidate  it is possible that before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized  our relevant patent rights may expire or such patent rights may remain in force for only a short period following commercialization 
patent expiration could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
also  patent rights may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights 
for example  we may not be able to prevent a third party from infringing our patents in a country that does not recognize or enforce patent rights  or that imposes compulsory licenses on or restricts the prices of life saving drugs 
changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we or our licensors do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the products or technologies we own or have licensed 
in addition  we may not have total control over the patent prosecution of subject matter that we license from others 
accordingly  we may be unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over our own 
others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any pending or issued patents we own or license  and rights we receive under those issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
we cannot assure you as to the degree of protection that will be afforded by any of our issued or pending patents  or those licensed by us 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we seek to protect these  in part  through confidentiality and non disclosure agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our technology or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
failure to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how could seriously impair our competitive position and harm our business 
we may become involved in costly litigation in order to enforce patent rights or protect trade secrets or know how that we own or license 
if a third party claims we are infringing on its intellectual property rights  we do not have the freedom to operate 
table of contents under our patents and we could incur significant expenses  or be prevented from further developing  or commercializing our product candidates 
our success will largely depend on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights of third parties 
this is generally referred to as having the freedom to operate 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are lengthy  costly and time consuming and their outcome is highly uncertain 
we may become involved in litigation in order to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others  or to determine whether we have the freedom to operate with respect to the intellectual property rights of others 
patent applications in the united states are  in most cases  maintained in secrecy until months after the patent application is filed 
the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made 
therefore  patent applications relating to products similar to our product candidates may have already been filed by others without our knowledge 
in the event an infringement claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay substantial legal fees and other expenses to defend such a claim and  if we are unsuccessful in defending the claim  we may be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of a product candidate and may be subject to injunctions and or damage awards 
if we become involved in any patent litigation  interference or other legal proceedings  we will incur substantial expense  and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
a negative outcome of such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing  manufacturing and selling our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
our current and future product candidates may be covered by third party patents or other intellectual property rights  in which case it would need to obtain a license or sublicense to these rights in order to have the appropriate freedom to operate and develop or commercialize them 
any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain the required licenses or sublicenses  we could encounter delays in the development of our product candidates  or be prevented from developing  manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates at all 
if it is determined that we have infringed an issued patent and do not have the freedom to operate  we could be subject to injunctions  and or compelled to pay significant damages  including punitive damages 
in cases where we have in licensed intellectual property  our failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such agreements could harm our business 
we may be unable to enter into future license  collaborations or other transactions with respect to our aurexis program  which could harm our business 
currently  we do not intend to continue to independently advance the clinical development of aurexis 
we plan to leverage our capabilities and intellectual property associated with our aurexis program by pursuing licenses  corporate collaborations or other business arrangements that could provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development and potential of the aurexis program 
we have several existing license and collaboration agreements based upon our mscramm protein platform 
these include an agreement with wyeth for the development of staphylococcal vaccines and with m company for the development of diagnostics products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully enter into any additional licenses  collaborations  or other transactions related to aurexis on terms acceptable to us or at all

the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile since the completion of our initial public offering in june the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including but not limited to our ability to successfully advance our drug development programs through preclinical and clinical development activities  disclosures of any favorable or unfavorable data from our preclinical studies or clinical trials  or other regulatory developments concerning our clinical trials  manufacturing or product candidates  our ability to manage our cash burn rate at an acceptable level  the approval or commercialization of new products by us or our competitors  and the disclosure thereof  announcements of scientific innovations by us or our competitors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  public concern about the safety of our product candidates  products or similar classes of products  litigation to which we may become subject  actual or anticipated variations in our annual and quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in drug reimbursement rates or government policies related to reimbursement  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  new regulatory legislation adopted in the united states or abroad  changes in patent legislation in the united states or abroad our failure to achieve or meet equity research analysts expectations or their estimates of our business  or a change in their recommendations concerning us  the value of our common stock or our industry in general  termination or delay in any of our existing or future collaborative arrangements  future sales of equity or debt securities in connection with raising capital  the sale of shares held by our directors or management  the loss of our eligibility to have shares of our common stock traded on the nasdaq global or capital market due to our failure to maintain minimum listing standards  changes in accounting principles  failure to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of publicly owned companies  under the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the sarbanes oxley act of  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and more specifically the nasdaq global and capital markets and the market for biotechnology stocks in particular  have historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
volatility in the market price for a particular biotechnology company s stock has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of that company 
market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
due to this volatility  investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid 
we currently do not meet the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq global market  and there is no guarantee that we will meet these standards in the future 
if we are delisted the value of your investment may substantially decrease 
to maintain our listing on the nasdaq global market  our common stock must have a closing bid price of 
table of contents for ten consecutive days before july   in addition to meeting other continued listing requirements of nasdaq marketplace rule a 
if we are unable to meet the closing bid price requirement before july   we may apply to transfer our listing to the nasdaq capital market if our common stock satisfies all of the criteria under marketplace rule c for initial inclusion on such market  other than compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
if our application is approved  the nasdaq marketplace rules provide that we will be afforded an additional calendar days to comply with the minimum bid price rule while listed on the nasdaq capital market 
if we fail to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market  our shares will likely trade on the nasdaq otc market 
we may consider a reverse stock spilt of our common stock to increase the bid price above 
any future delisting or change in market class from nasdaq may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  significantly limit the liquidity of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional funds 
future issuances of shares of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline  even if our business is doing well 
the issuance of a significant number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that such future sales could occur  particularly with respect to our directors  executive officers  and other insiders or their affiliates  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities at a price we deem appropriate 
if we raise additional capital in the future  your ownership in us could be diluted 
we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in the future to support or fund our current strategy and our planned operations 
any issuance of additional equity we may undertake in the future could cause the price of our common stock to decline  or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past  which would result in those shares being dilutive 
if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities  these securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common stockholder 
insiders and affiliates continue to have substantial control over us  which could delay or prevent a change in control of us 
as of december   our directors and executive officers  together with their affiliates  beneficially owned  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  may have the ability to delay or prevent a change in control that may be favored by other stockholders and otherwise exercise significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote  including the appointment of directors  the appointment  change or termination of management  any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  the approval of some acquisitions or mergers and other significant corporate transactions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  or the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of delaware  the state in which we are incorporated  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions establish a classified  or staggered  board of directors  so that not all members of our board may be elected at one time  set limitations on the removal of directors  
table of contents limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and provide our board of directors the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to remove and elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item properties we lease our  square foot office and laboratory facility  which is located in alpharetta  georgia  a northern suburb of atlanta 
we entered into this lease in december and occupied this facility during the second quarter of our minimum lease obligations for this facility will approximate to million per annum for the lease term of ten years

item legal proceedings on april   we announced that we did not anticipate performing any additional clinical trials in very low birth weight infants with a donor selected immune globulin form of veronate and therefore would halt the manufacture of the clinical trial material used in the clinical development of veronate 
as a result  we terminated our contract manufacturing relationship with nabi biopharmaceuticals  inc  or nabi  and suspended future purchases of all raw materials used to manufacture the donor selected immune globulin form of veronate 
subsequent to the termination date  nabi invoiced us for approximately million in cancellation penalties and other amounts it contends are due as a result of our termination of the manufacturing agreement  which we disputed 
on july   nabi commenced an arbitration action against us seeking to recover a total of approximately million in connection with the termination of the manufacturing agreement 
on february   an arbitrator ruled we were liable to nabi biopharmaceuticals  inc for restitution and cancellation payments in the aggregate amount of approximately million  including million with respect to restitution for prior production under the agreement and million relating to cancellation fees  as a result of our termination of a contract manufacturing agreement with nabi during we incurred a charge of million in as a result of the arbitrator s ruling 
the ruling provided for interest at a rate of per annum commencing days after the date of the award 
in march  nabi filed a petition with the supreme court of the state of new york the court to confirm the arbitrator s award  and we cross petitioned to have the award set aside 
on october   we learned that the court had vacated approximately million out of a total of approximately million that an arbitrator had awarded nabi in february the court confirmed the million award of restitution and vacated the million award of cancellation fees 
on january   we paid the million award with accrued interest 
on january   nabi filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision to the extent it vacated the portion of the arbitration award relating to the million of cancellation fees

overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated anti infective products to prevent and treat serious infections 
in we adopted a strategy to pursue pre clinical or clinical stage antiviral development programs via in licensing  or acquisition  and postponed the initiation of any additional clinical trials of aurexis pending the finalization of these strategic activities 
in connection with this strategy  we entered into the following transactions as described below 

table of contents on april   we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with fermavir pharmaceuticals  inc or fermavir 
on september   we consummated the acquisition of fermavir 
fermavir s development stage antiviral pipeline included fv  a nucleoside analogue for the treatment of herpes zoster infections shingles  and a series of preclinical nucleoside analogue compounds for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus  or cmv disease 
on september   we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the university of georgia research foundation  or ugarf  for intellectual property covering a series of human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  integrase inhibitors and other antiviral compounds in exchange for an upfront license fee  future milestone payments and royalties on future net sales 
the license agreement also includes intellectual property related to hepatitis c polymerase  or hcv  inhibitors 
in connection with this license agreement  we also entered into a sponsored research agreement with ugarf to provide up to three years of financial support for specified research and development activities related to the licensed compounds and intellectual property 
on november   we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with cardiff university in wales  united kingdom and katholieke universiteit in leuven  belgium for intellectual property covering a series of hepatitis c virus hcv polymerase inhibitors in exchange for an upfront license fee  future milestone payments and royalties on future net sales 
as a result of these transactions  we have changed our strategic focus with respect to the anti infective market and are primarily concentrating our efforts on the development of antiviral small molecules 
we intend to target our antiviral development efforts on treatments for shingles  hiv infection  chronic hepatitis c  and cytomegalovirus  or cmv 
due to this strategic transformation  we have exited the development stage for financial statement presentation and all periods prior to october  were presented as a development stage company 
from our inception in to until mid  we devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts towards the discovery and development of novel antibody based products for the prevention and treatment of serious bacterial and fungal infections  all of which were based upon our proprietary mscramm protein platform 
in november  we completed enrollment of a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of veronate  our lead product candidate at that time  which we had been developing for the prevention of hospital associated staphylococcal aureus infections in premature  very low birth weight infants 
on april   we announced that this pivotal phase iii trial did not achieve its primary endpoint  or any of its secondary endpoints 
in light of these phase iii trial results  we discontinued the development of veronate  reduced our workforce and realigned our operations consistent with the status of other mscramm based development programs 
we do not plan to allocate any additional resources to advance the clinical development of programs based upon our mscramm protein platform  but rather further leverage our capabilities and intellectual property associated with our mscramm protein platform by pursuing licenses  co development  collaborations or other business arrangements that can provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development and potential of these programs  including aurexis 
we have neither received regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  nor do we have any commercialization capabilities  therefore  it is possible that we may never successfully derive significant collaboration revenues or any commercial revenues from any of our existing or future product candidates or preclinical development programs 
we expect that our future operations will result in a net loss on a quarterly and yearly basis for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
financial operations overview revenue 
we have begun to generate revenues from the licensing of our products  but would not expect substantial product related revenues until we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates 
our revenues represented the amortization of an up front license fee and periodic research and 
table of contents development support payments we have received in connection with a license and collaboration agreements with wyeth and m  and from time to time  grant revenue and proceeds from research activities we performed under a materials transfer agreement not covered by a license or collaboration agreement 
we may generate future revenues from up front license fees or milestone payments in connection with existing or future collaborators  or other strategic relationships and royalties resulting from the licensing of our intellectual property 
if our or any of our collaborators future development efforts result in regulatory approval and the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates or collaborated product candidates  we expect the majority of our future revenues would then result from milestones  royalties  or other product revenue agreements 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of the costs incurred to discover  develop  test and manufacture our product candidates 
these costs consist primarily of research activities and preclinical studies and supplies associated with development activities by internal staff  professional fees paid to third party service providers in conjunction with treating patients enrolled in our clinical trials and monitoring  accumulating and evaluating the related data  salaries and personnel related expenses for our internal staff  including share based compensation  the cost of product candidates  including contract manufacturing services  legal fees associated with patents and intellectual property  consulting  depreciation  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and facilities costs 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and direct external costs represent expenses paid to third parties that specifically relate to product candidates in pre clinical or clinical development  such as payments to third parties that perform development services  such as toxicological tests  contract research organizations that monitor  accumulate and analyze data from our clinical trials  investigators who treat the patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the cost of manufacturing clinical trial material including raw materials 
all remaining research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel related expenses  supplies  depreciation  legal patent services  consulting  general licenses and sponsored research  facility costs and other overhead costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program and are included in unallocated costs and overhead 
research and development spending for past periods is not indicative of spending in future periods 
years ended december  in millions direct external costs veronate aurexis fv preclinical programs unallocated costs and overhead total research and development expenses for the year ended december   fv includes million of in process research and development expense incurred in connection with the fermavir acquisition 
we anticipate that our research and development costs will increase in  as compared to our annualized expense for fourth quarter of due to our development plans for fv and our other preclinical other programs 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and regulatory approval of clinical trails and preclinical studies  our future expenditures are likely to be highly volatile in future periods depending on the outcomes 
from time to time  we will make determinations as to how much funding to direct to these programs in response to their scientific  clinical and regulatory success  and anticipated market opportunity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of our existing or future product candidates  if at all  and some of the possible consequences of failing to do so  is set forth in the risk factors section of this form k 

table of contents in process research and development expense 
in connection with the acquisition of fermavir  we recorded an in process research and development ipr d charge of million during the third quarter of the acquired ipr d project is fv  a compound in development as a potential treatment of varicella zoster virus vzv  the causative agent for shingles and chickenpox 
the cmv program acquired did not qualify as a project for ipr d purposes and was excluded from the purchase price allocation 
the fair value of the ipr d project was determined utilizing the income approach  assuming that the rights to the ipr d project will be sublicensed in the future to third parties in exchange for certain upfront  milestone and royalty payments  and the combined company will have no further involvement in the ongoing development and commercialization of the projects 
under the income approach  the expected future net cash flows from sublicensing the ipr d project are estimated  risk adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the development process and discounted to their net present value 
because the acquired ipr d project is in the early stages of the development cycle and has no alternative future use  the amount allocated to ipr d was recorded as an expense immediately upon completion of the acquisition 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  including share based compensation for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  sales and marketing  business development and human resources functions 
other significant costs include professional fees for legal  auditing  market research and other consulting services  as well as premiums for insurance  other expenses a result of being publicly traded  and depreciation and facility expenses 
in  we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively consistent as those we incurred in interest and other income expense  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents short term investments and long term investments 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and notes payable 
other income and expense has historically consisted of the proceeds from the sale of excess raw materials  the gain or loss on the disposal of equipment  and the reversal of a liability for which the obligation to provide further services or settlement is not required 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our current financial condition and historical results of operations are based on our audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are important in understanding our financial statements and operating results 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions  and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under licensing and other collaborative research and development agreements as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 
accordingly  up front  non refundable license fees under agreements in which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the term of our ongoing obligations under the agreement 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative arrangements are recognized as the research and development activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
in the event we receive milestone payments in the future  we will recognize such payments when all of the terms of such milestone are achieved 
accrued expenses 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to estimate expenses that we believe have 
table of contents been incurred  but for which we have not yet received invoices from our vendors 
this process involves identifying services and activities that have been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of significant expenses for which we generally accrue based on estimates include fees for services  such as those provided by certain clinical research and data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  certain research organizations that perform preclinical studies and fees owed to certain contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of materials for our clinical trials 
in order to estimate costs incurred to date  but have not yet have been invoiced  we analyze the progress and related activities  the terms of the underlying contract or agreement and invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
we make these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

lease accounting 
we have entered into a lease for our facility pursuant to which leasehold improvements paid by the lessor pursuant to the lease agreement were capitalized 
the leasehold improvement assets are being amortized over seven years and the liability is being amortized over life of the lease  which is ten years for the liability 
the amortization is recorded as a discount to rent expense for the liability and the amortization expense to leasehold improvements for the asset 
the balances of the capitalized lessor paid leasehold improvements are classified in the balance sheet as leasehold improvements for the asset and other liabilities for the liability  respectively 
in addition  we took possession  or control of  the physical use of the facility in january  at which time the work was initiated on the leasehold improvements 
the leasehold improvements were completed in may this four month gap constituted a rent holiday 
as such  we accrued rent for that time period 
this accrued rent is being amortized as a discount to rent over the remaining year life of the lease 
the balance of this rent accrual is classified in the balance sheet as other liabilities

clinical trial expenses decreased by million due to the completion of the veronate phase iii clinical trial in april  and a decrease of million in clinical trial expenses for the aurexis program  offset in part by a million increase for trial expenses for the fv program in related to the recently completed exploratory phase i trial 
preclinical development costs increased by million in due to preclinical studies related to our fv program  offset by a slight decrease in sponsored research activities 
manufacturing expenses decreased by million in due to the non recurring costs being recorded in related to the termination of a contract manufacturing agreement in and the completion of trial material for the veronate program in salaries  benefits  and share based compensation expenses decreased in due to reductions in personnel levels and lower severance and termination obligations of million that were recorded in  as well as a reduction in share based compensation expense of million

table of contents in the increase of million was the result of a million increase in other income from the sale of excess raw material that was originally purchased for the manufacture of veronate  offset in part by a decrease of million decrease in net interest income due to lower average cash balances on investments and higher interest expenses 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception in may through december   we have funded our operations primarily with million in gross proceeds raised from a series of five private equity financings  our ipo in june  and two pipe financings  or private placement of public equity financings 
from inception through december   we have also borrowed a total of million under various notes payable  a credit facility with a commercial bank and capital leases  and have received approximately million in license fees  collaborative research payments and grants  of which million and million were recorded as deferred revenue as of december  and december   respectively 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and we held no investments with a maturity greater than months 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are generally held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of united states government agency securities  high grade corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and money market accounts that have an average maturity date of less than months 
cash flows for the year ended december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased by million  from million to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from cash used for operating activities as well as from acquisition and in licensing activities  the payment of accrued restructuring charges  the repayment of capital lease obligations and notes payable and capital expenditures 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  which reflects our net loss for the period of million plus net cash used from changes in operating accounts of million  excluding those operating accounts acquired in the fermavir acquisition  offset by non cash charges of million included in our net loss 
our net loss was largely the result of the acquisition of fermavir  cost of funding our preclinical studies and clinical trials associated with fv  other research and development activities  general and administrative expenses and expenses associated with the in licensing of our new product candidates  offset by the sale of excess raw materials  the amortization of deferred revenue from license and collaboration agreements  and net interest income 
the million net cash used by the net changes in operating accounts  excluding those operating accounts acquired in the fermavir acquisition  consisted of million in decrease accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated largely with the payment of severance and termination obligations  and professional and legal fees associated with merger and acquisition activities  offset by million decrease in receivables and a million increase in deferred revenue due to revenue earned 
we received approximately million of cash from investing activities during  which primarily consisted of net sales of short term investments of million  offset by million of cash paid in connection with the acquisition of fermavir 
we used net cash of million from financing activities during  which consisted of largely of payments on our capital leases and promissory notes 

table of contents funding requirements our future funding requirements are difficult to determine and will depend on a number of factors  including any changes in our strategy in the future  the development plans and timing of our pipeline  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting pre clinical studies  the cost of manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials for our product candidates  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting clinical trials  the rate of enrollment in such clinical trials and the results of these clinical trials  the cost to obtain and timing of regulatory approvals required to advance the development of our programs or product candidates  the number of product candidates we may advance into clinical development  future payments we may receive or make under existing or future license or collaboration agreements if any  whether we obtain additional preclinical or clinical stage product candidates or programs through future in licensing or acquisition  the cost to maintain a corporate infrastructure to support being a publicly traded company  the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims  and the future need to acquire additional licenses or acquire product candidates or programs 
based on our current strategy and operating plan  and considering the potential costs associated with advancing the development of our existing pipeline on our planned timelines  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments of million as of december   including proceeds from anticipated existing licensing agreements and collaborations will enable us to operate for a period of at least months from the date of this filing  even if the lower court s decision in our favor is overturn on appeal or the dispute is otherwise resolved 
our estimate assumes that we advance fv  and one or two of our other antiviral programs into clinical development 
this estimate does not include the potential costs for the further development of the mscramm platform  including aurexis  and any other significant transaction or change in our strategy or development plans 
we currently do not have any commitments for future funding  nor do we anticipate that we will generate significant revenue from the sale of any products in the foreseeable future 
therefore  in order to meet our anticipated liquidity needs beyond months  or possibly sooner in the event we enter into other transactions or change our strategy or development plans  we may need to raise additional capital 
we would expect to do so primarily through the sale of additional common stock or other equity securities or licensing agreements  strategic collaborations  forms of debt financing  or any other financing vehicle 
funds from these sources may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our failure to raise such funds could have a material adverse impact on our business strategy  plans  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available to us in the future  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  delay or curtail our preclinical studies and clinical trials  or obtain funds through license agreements  collaborative or partner arrangements pursuant to which we will likely have to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise choose to develop or commercialize independently 
additional equity financings may be dilutive to 
table of contents holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant payment obligations and restrictive covenants that restrict how we operate our business
