item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an assessment of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management s determination of estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities requires the exercise of judgment in the selection and application of assumptions based on various factors  including historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we routinely evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer returns and promotions  provisions for bad debts  inventory valuations  useful lives of fixed assets  hedge transactions  supplemental retirement benefits  intangible asset valuations  incentive compensation  income taxes  self insurance  postretirement benefits  contingencies and legal proceedings 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
executive summary our focus for included integrating the operations and management of all of our facilities  while continuing to implement the key initiatives of our strategic plan which we expect will provide a strong foundation for future growth 
the key initiatives include the following organizational development and effectiveness  operational efficiencies in our dsd operations  supply chain process  and information technology systems  focused growth in core channels and product lines 
in  we continued to improve our leadership team through key additions in sales  marketing  information technology  human resources and supply chain 
in addition to centralizing our organization  we continued to build on cross functional  multi facility team initiatives to improve the cost effectiveness of the organization 
another significant undertaking in was the review and analysis of the alignment of the dsd system in order to improve dsd retention  increase weekly route sales averages  improve dsd profitability and enhance customer satisfaction 
during  we significantly improved the retention rate of our route sales representatives 
we also increased weekly route sales averages by approximately 
in order to support the dsd system  we spent million on route trucks and million for new handheld computers in order to replace aging equipment 
we also significantly realigned our dsd system by reducing the total number of routes and improving the sales support structure to strengthen overall revenue and profitability 

table of contents our supply chain team made significant strides in improving the operations of the organization 
in  we began the implementation of a demand planning system in order to reduce overall inventory levels  product obsolescence and overtime for the production of out of stock inventory 
we continued to centralize procurement opportunities for supplies and services to provide economies of scale in purchasing  including common third party agreements of outside freight for all plant locations 
we continued to invest an additional million in higher capacity trailers in order to reduce the number of miles driven 
these initiatives aided in the reduction of service and distribution costs in in  we invested million  in information systems as we began the implementation of an erp oracle system  which will be phased in over the next years 
in addition to the oracle system implementation that is currently underway  we also implemented other information systems during to provide greater access to sales data and improve the efficiency of financial planning and reporting 
during the third quarter of  we successfully completed the discontinuation of our vending business with minimal impact to our financial results 
although the discontinuation was a time consuming process  we are now able to better focus on the profitable areas of our business 
our approach to revenue growth has two phases 
the first phase focuses on our core strengths and simplification of our business 
in  in addition to discontinuing our vending business  we also continued to rationalize our product offerings and focused our attention on products  channels and geographical locations where we can profitably grow our business 
our second phase for revenue growth focuses on accelerating sales in both our branded and non branded products through internal innovation  partnerships and acquisitions that will allow us to be a better partner for our customers and leverage the talents of our team  customer relationships  operational capabilities and capacity 
during  we invested in an organic snack food company and introduced new products to meet the demands of a more diversified customer base 
despite the significant improvements in our core operations  the challenge that our organization faced in was the unprecedented increase in flour and vegetable oil prices that began significantly affecting us during the third quarter of and continued throughout the remainder of the year 
the cost of wheat  the main ingredient for flour  more than doubled in from a bushel at the beginning of the year to approximately a bushel for most of the fourth quarter 
in addition  soybean oil  the basis for most vegetable oil prices  increased approximately compared to for  the net increase in ingredient costs compared to was million  of which million of the increase occurred during the fourth quarter of this was in addition to the increases that occurred in for ingredients of million compared to based on our current production and without corresponding price increases to our customers  an increase of in the price per bushel of wheat reduces our diluted earnings per share by approximately  and a increase in a pound of soybean oil reduces our diluted earnings per share by approximately 
moving into  we expect that the increase in ingredient costs will continue to negatively affect financial results  especially during the first half of  despite planned price increases 
the impact of the weakening us dollar compared to the canadian dollar also had an unfavorable impact to earnings of million in compared to the effect of foreign exchange on earnings is included in both cost of goods sold and other income loss on our income statement 

table of contents revenue from continuing operations increased million or 
million of the increase related to branded revenue as we continued to demonstrate strong growth in the lance sandwich crackers  cape cod potato chips  tom s hot fries and bugles 
private brand revenue increased million and revenue from contract manufacturing increased million 
in  net income from continuing operations increased million compared to during  we had million of expenses  after tax related to the integration of the tom s facilities 
excluding the costs related to the integration of the tom s facilities  net income increased million compared to despite the impact of increased ingredient costs  gross margin increased million 
selling  marketing and delivery expenses decreased million because of improved efficiencies in distribution costs and reductions in dsd operation expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million due to increased professional fees and salaries and benefits in order to support our objective of increasing revenue and profitability and to position the company with the infrastructure to support future growth 
due to the decision to implement a new erp system  we wrote off million of previously capitalized system costs that will not be utilized in the income tax rate decreased from in to in due in part to reductions in foreign income tax rates 
accordingly  our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for were as compared to in during  expenses related to the integration of tom s lowered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 
critical accounting estimates preparing the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe the following estimates and assumptions to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions and estimates may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and may have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our policy on revenue recognition varies based on the types of products sold and the distribution method 
we recognize operating revenue when title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
allowances for sales returns  stale products  promotions and discounts are also recorded as reductions of revenue in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue for products sold through our dsd system is recognized when the product is delivered to the retailer 
our sales representative creates the invoice at time of delivery using a handheld computer 
the invoice is transmitted electronically each day and sales revenue is recognized 
customers purchasing products through the dsd system have the right to return product if it is not sold by the expiration date on the product label 
we have recorded an estimated allowance for product that might be returned as a reduction to revenue 
we estimate the number of days until product is sold through the customer s location and the percent of sales returns using historical information 
this information is reviewed on a quarterly basis for significant changes and updated no less than annually 

table of contents revenue for products shipped directly to the customer from our warehouse is recognized based on the shipping terms listed on the shipping documentation 
products shipped with terms fob shipping point are recognized as revenue at the time the shipment leaves our warehouses 
products shipped with terms fob destination are recognized as revenue based on the anticipated receipt date by the customer 
we record certain reductions to revenue for promotional allowances 
there are several different types of promotional allowances such as off invoice allowances  rebates and shelf space allowances 
an off invoice allowance is a reduction of the sales price that is directly deducted from the invoice amount 
we record the amount of the deduction as a reduction to revenue when the transaction occurs 
rebates are offered to customers based on the quantity of product purchased over a period of time 
based on the nature of these allowances  the exact amount of the rebate is not known at the time the product is sold to the customer 
an estimate of the expected rebate amount is recorded as a reduction to revenue and an accrued liability at the time the sale is recorded 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the period covered by the promotion 
the accrual is based on historical information and the progress of the customer against the target amount 
shelf space allowances are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the agreement or three years and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
capitalized shelf space allowances are evaluated for impairment on an ongoing basis 
we also record certain allowances for coupon redemptions  scan back promotions and other promotional activities as a reduction to revenue 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the period covered by the coupon or promotion 
total allowances for sales returns  rebates  coupons  scan backs and other promotional activities are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and were million and million at december   and december   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimate of uncollectible accounts receivables 
we record a general reserve based on analysis of historical data 
in addition  management records specific reserves for receivable balances that are considered at higher risk due to known facts regarding the customer 
the assumptions for this determination are regularly reviewed to ensure that business conditions or other circumstances are consistent with the assumptions 
allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
self insurance reserves we maintain reserves for the self funded portions of employee medical insurance and for post retirement healthcare benefits 
the employer s portion of employee and retiree medical claims is limited by stop loss insurance coverage each year to million per person 
in addition  we maintain insurance reserves for the self funded portions of workers compensation  auto  product and general liability insurance 
self insured accruals are based on claims filed and estimated claims incurred but not reported based on historical claims trends 

table of contents for casualty insurance obligations  we maintain self insurance reserves for workers compensation and auto liability for individual losses up to million 
in addition  general and product liability claims are self funded for individual losses up to million 
we evaluate input from a third party actuary in the estimation of the casualty insurance obligation on an annual basis 
in determining the ultimate loss and reserve requirements  we use various actuarial assumptions including compensation trends  healthcare cost trends and discount rates 
we also use historical information for claims frequency and severity in order to establish loss development factors 
in  this estimate of loss reserves ranged from million to million 
consistent with prior periods  the th percentile of this range represents our best estimate of the ultimate outstanding casualty liability 
we used a investment rate in and to discount the estimated claims based on the historical payout pattern 
impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the annual impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets requires us to project future financial performance  including revenue and profit growth  fixed asset and working capital investments  income tax rates and cost of capital 
these projections rely upon historical performance  anticipated market conditions and forward looking business plans 
the analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  assumes combined average annual revenue growth of approximately during the valuation period 
we also use a combination of internal and external data to develop the weighted average cost of capital 
significant investments in fixed assets and working capital to support this growth are estimated and factored into the analysis 
if the forecasted revenue growth is not achieved  the required investments in fixed assets and working capital could be reduced 
even with the excess fair value over carrying value  significant changes in assumptions or changes in conditions could result in a goodwill impairment charge in the future 
depreciation and impairment of fixed assets depreciation of fixed assets is computed using the straight line method over the lives of the assets 
the lives used in computing depreciation are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will provide economic benefits 
estimated lives are based on historical experience  maintenance practices  technological changes and future business plans 
depreciation expense was million and million during and  respectively 
changes in these estimated lives and increases in capital expenditures could significantly affect depreciation expense in the future 
fixed assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of fixed assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if this comparison indicates that an asset s carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized  and the adjusted carrying amount is depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 
assets that are to be disposed of by sale are recognized in the financial statements at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  and are not depreciated once they are classified as held for sale 
in order for an asset to be classified as held for sale  the asset must be actively marketed  available for immediate sale and meet certain other specified criteria 

table of contents equity incentive expense determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited before vesting 
in addition  our long term equity incentive plans require assumptions and projections of future operating results and financial metrics 
actual results may differ from these assumptions and projections  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
provision for income taxes we estimate valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for the portions that we do not believe will be fully utilized based on projected earnings and usage 
our effective tax rate is based on the level and mix of income of our separate legal entities  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions that affect the annual tax rate 
unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are established in accordance with fin when  despite the fact that the tax return positions are supportable  we believe these positions may be challenged and the results are uncertain 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risks that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position are changes in raw material prices  energy and fuel costs  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and credit risks 
we selectively use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
there are no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
at times  we may enter into commodity futures and other derivative contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials 
our policy is to use these commodity derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage these exposures 
as of december   and december  there were no outstanding commodity futures contracts or other derivative contracts related to raw materials 
for the year ended december   the increase in commodity costs increased our cost of sales by million as compared to our debt obligations incur interest at floating rates  based on changes in the eurodollar rate  canadian bankers acceptance discount rate  canadian prime rate and us base rate interest 
to manage exposure to changing interest rates  we selectively enter into interest rate swap agreements to maintain a desirable proportion of fixed to variable rate debt 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to manage the risk associated with variable interest rates 
the variable to fixed interest rate swap was accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity date of the swap matched the principal  interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt

a majority of the revenue of our canadian operations is denominated in us dollars and a substantial portion of the operations costs  such as raw materials and direct labor  are denominated in canadian dollars 
we have entered into a series of forward contracts to mitigate a portion of this foreign exchange rate exposure 
these contracts have maturities through december as of december   the fair value of the asset related to the forward contracts as determined by a third party financial institution was million 
net cash settlements under the forward contracts are reflected in revenue in the consolidated statements of income in the applicable period
