item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture and sell versatile and high performance video products and system solutions that enable service providers to efficiently deliver the next generation of broadcast and on demand services  including high definition television  or hdtv  video on demand  or vod  network personal video recording and time shifted tv 
historically  the majority of our sales have been derived from sales of video processing solutions and edge and access systems to cable television operators and from sales of video processing solutions to direct to home satellite operators 
we also provide our video processing solutions to telecommunications companies  or telcos  broadcasters and internet companies that offer video services to their customers 
harmonic s net sales increased in from  and decreased in from the increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to stronger demand from our domestic and international satellite operators and our domestic cable operators  and sales of our recently introduced products 
the decrease in sales in compared to was primarily due to lower fttp product sales and sales of third party products in we believe that the improvement in the industry capital spending environment has been  in part  a result of the intense competition between cable and satellite operators to offer more channels of digital video and new services  such as vod and hdtv  and in part the result of the entry of telephone companies into the business of delivering video services to their subscribers 
we also believe that the improvement has been due to more favorable conditions in industry capital markets and the completion or resolution of certain major business combinations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
historically  a majority of our net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  sales to comcast and echostar accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
sales to comcast accounted for and of net sales in and  respectively 
sales to customers outside of the us in   and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
in  net sales increased by compared to  primarily due to stronger demand from domestic and international satellite operators and from domestic cable operators  and sales of our recently introduced products 
the improved gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher gross margins from new products and an increase in the proportion of net sales from software  which has higher margins that our hardware products 
in addition  in we continued to reduce our sales of fttp products which have significantly lower gross margins than our other products 
our operating results for also included a charge of million for the expected settlement of the securities class action lawsuit and a net credit of million consisting of a million credit from a revised estimate of expected sublease income due to the extension of a sublease of a building to the lease expiration which was partially offset by a charge of million from a change in estimated sublease income for a sunnyvale building and a charge of million from the closure of the manufacturing and research and development activities of btl 
in  net sales decreased by compared to which was primarily due to lower fttp sales and sales of third party products 
harmonic reported net income of million in which was primarily the result of higher gross margins 
the improved gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher gross margins from new products and an increase in the proportion of net sales from software and services 
in addition  we reduced our sales of fttp and third party products which have significantly lower gross margins than our other products 
cost of sales and operating expenses include an expense for stock based compensation of million related to the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents restructuring charges totaling million were recorded in as a result of a management reorganization and a sunnyvale campus consolidation 
prior to  harmonic was organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks  or ban  for fiber optic systems and convergent systems  or cs  for digital headend systems 
effective january   an organizational restructuring combined the company s cs division and ban division into a single segment with financial results reported as a single segment as of the first quarter of our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly due to delays in project completion  revenue recognition policies and the timing of the receipt of orders 
harmonic often recognizes a significant portion  or the majority  of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders  delays in project completion and revenue recognition policies can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
in the fourth quarter of  due to an organizational restructuring that combined our product development  marketing and manufacturing operations into a single segment  harmonic reduced its workforce by approximately employees and recorded severance charges of approximately million 
the acquisition of entone in the fourth quarter of increased our headcount by employees  primarily in research and development 
the acquisition of rhozet in july increased our headcount by employees  primarily in research and development 
in may  our board of directors appointed patrick j 
harshman as president and chief executive officer  replacing anthony ley  who retired after years 
mr 
ley carries on as chairman of our board of directors and has a consulting agreement with harmonic through june following dr 
harshman s appointment  we announced a reorganization of our senior management  resulting in a charge of approximately million in severance costs in the second quarter of in and excess facilities charges totaling million were recorded due to harmonic s reduced headcount  difficult business conditions and a weak local commercial real estate market 
the excess facilities charges were for facilities that we no longer occupied  that we did not intend to occupy and that we planned to sublease 
in  the excess facilities liability was reduced by million due to a revision in the assumptions as to the unoccupied portion of a building 
in the fourth quarter of  the excess facilities liability was decreased by million due to subleasing a portion of the unoccupied portion of one building for the remainder of the lease 
although we entered into new subleases for approximately  square feet of space in  approximately  square feet of space in and approximately  square feet of space in  in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability  which could materially impact our financial position  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in the third quarter of  we completed our facilities rationalization plan resulting in more efficient use of our sunnyvale campus and vacated several buildings  some of which were subsequently subleased 
this resulted in a net charge for excess facilities of million in the third quarter of in the third quarter of  we recorded a credit of million from a revised estimate of expected sublease income due to the extension of a sublease of a sunnyvale building to the lease expiration 
in addition  in we recorded a restructuring change of million on a reduction in estimated sublease income for a sunnyvale building  and a charge of million from the closure of the manufacturing and research and development activities of broadcast technology limited 

table of contents on december   harmonic completed its acquisition of entone technologies  inc pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  or entone agreement dated august   for a total purchase consideration of million 
the purchase consideration consisted of a payment of million  the issuance of  shares of harmonic common stock with a value of million  issuance of  options to purchase harmonic common stock with a value of million and acquisition related costs of million 
under the terms of the entone agreement  entone spun off its consumer premises equipment  or cpe  business into a separate private company prior to the closing of the merger 
as part of the terms of the entone agreement  harmonic purchased a convertible note with a face amount of million in the new spun off private company in july on july   harmonic completed its acquisition of rhozet corporation  pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  or rhozet agreement  dated july  under the rhozet agreement  harmonic paid or will pay an aggregate of approximately million in total merger consideration  comprised of approximately million in cash   shares of harmonic s common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of rhozet  and approximately million of cash which was paid in the first quarter of  as provided in the rhozet agreement  to the holders of outstanding options to acquire rhozet common stock 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition  harmonic incurred approximately million in transaction costs 
pursuant to the rhozet agreement  approximately million of the total merger consideration  consisting of cash and shares of harmonic common stock  are being held back by harmonic for at least months following the closing of the acquisition to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of rhozet s shareholders pursuant to the terms of the rhozet agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold and issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  which was net of underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million and related legal  accounting  printing and other costs totaling approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including payment of existing liabilities  research and development  the development or acquisition of new products or technologies  equipment acquisitions  strategic acquisitions of businesses  general working capital and operating expenses 
the offering was made pursuant to our registration statement on form s file no

revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from sales of hardware products  software products  solution sales  services and hardware and software maintenance agreements 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we account for the product as a software product 
revenue on software products and software related elements are recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
revenue from hardware product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
subject to other revenue recognition provisions  revenue on product sales is recognized when risk of loss and title has transferred  which is generally upon shipment or delivery  based on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally recognized on delivery or sell in 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific capital equipment projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our equipment to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we have had extensive experience monitoring product returns from our distributors and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns and allowances can be reasonably estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  and sab with respect to these sales  we evaluate the terms of sale and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred 
when arrangements contain multiple elements  harmonic evaluates all deliverables in the arrangement at the outset of the arrangement based on the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
if the undelivered elements qualify as separate units of accounting based on the criteria in eitf  which include that the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements  harmonic allocates the arrangement fee based on the relative fair value of the elements of the arrangement 
if a delivered element does not meet the criteria in eitf to be considered a separate unit of accounting  revenue is deferred until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
we establish fair value by reference to the price the customer is required to pay when an item is sold separately using contractually stated  substantive renewal rates  where applicable  or the average price of recently completed stand alone sales transactions 
accordingly  the 
table of contents determination as to whether appropriate objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists can impact the timing of revenue recognition for an arrangement 
for multiple element arrangements that include both hardware products and software products  harmonic evaluates the arrangement based on eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf  the arrangement is divided between software related elements and non software deliverables 
software related elements are accounted for as software 
software related elements include all non software deliverables for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality 
when software arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  harmonic accounts for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop no 
in arrangements where vsoe of fair value is not available for all undelivered elements  we defer the recognition of all revenue until all elements have been delivered 
fair value of software related elements is based on separate sales to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
we also enter into solution sales for the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of products to the specifications of harmonic s customers  including equipment acquired from third parties to be integrated with harmonic s products 
these arrangements typically include the configuration of system interfaces between harmonic product and customer third party equipment  and optimization of the overall solution to operate with the unique features of the customer s design and to meet customer specific performance requirements 
revenue on these arrangements is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction production contracts 
we measure performance under the percentage of completion method using the efforts expended method based on labor hours expended in proportion to total estimated hours  based on current estimates of labor hours to complete the project 
management believes that for each such project  labor hours expended in proportion to total estimated hours at completion represents the most reliable and meaningful measure for determining a project s progress toward completion 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized  net of deferred costs of sales 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor hours to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position or cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
revenue from hardware and software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
first year maintenance typically is included in the original arrangement and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
services revenue is recognized on performance of the services and costs associated with services are recognized as incurred 
fair value of services such as consulting and training is based upon separate sales of these services 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
because of the concentrated nature of our customer base  different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract or customer could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience  our operating results  financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 
at december   our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts totaled million 

table of contents valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the cost of excess or obsolete inventory to net realizable value based on future demand forecasts and historical demand 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management is of critical importance in order to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
impairment of goodwill or long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis and of intangibles and other long lived assets whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles  goodwill or long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
our review of intangibles in determined that the remaining balance of million of the intangibles acquired as a result of the btl acquisition in february had been impaired based on the discontinuance of the decoder product line obtained in the acquisition 
at december   our carrying values for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities to determine our excess facility accruals we estimate expected sublease rental income on each excess facility 
in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability which could materially impact our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
at december   our accrual for excess facilities totaled million 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on a tentative agreement to resolve its outstanding securities class action lawsuit  harmonic believes that a probable and estimable liability has been incurred  and  accordingly  has recorded a provision of million in its statement of operations for the year ended december  in other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it either has meritorious defenses with respect to those actions and claims or is unable to predict the impact of an adverse action and  accordingly  no loss contingencies have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of these legal proceedings or failure to settle the securities litigation on the terms proposed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results or cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
based on our judgment that the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions will be recovered from future taxable income is not more likely than not  we have maintained a full valuation allowance at december  in such jurisdictions 

table of contents our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our accompanying combined balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow the guidelines set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
determining necessary allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
as of december   we had an approximate million valuation allowance recorded as an offset against certain of our net deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas  we have evaluated our need for a valuation allowance based on historical evidence  trends in profitability and expectations of future taxable income 
the company will continue to monitor available positive and negative evidence in future periods to determine if any or all of the remaining valuation allowance should be released 
if we were to release the entire million valuation allowance it would result in a credit to tax expense of million  a credit to goodwill of million and a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity of million 
in periods following the release of our valuation allowance our expectation is that the company will experience a substantial increase in our effective tax rate 
we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities on a periodic basis 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of the beginning of prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
the effects of final resolution  if any  were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  fin permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves and penalties as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas r  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
sfas r supersedes the company s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations  and provided the required pro forma disclosures prescribed by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas as amended 
in addition  we have applied the provisions of sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission  in our adoption of sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee equity awards and employee stock purchases 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee equity awards and employee stock purchases recognized during the year ended december  
table of contents sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for employee equity awards and employee stock purchases using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under sfas under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations because the exercise price of the company s stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of attributing the value of stock based compensation costs to expense from the accelerated multiple option method to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards related to stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted subsequent to december  are recognized using the straight line method 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in our results for the years ended december  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to fiscal year  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred for the purposes of pro forma information under sfas  as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the related periods 
the fair value of share based payment awards is estimated at grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as the assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  fsp r 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method provides a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of fsp r did not have an impact on our overall consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
consistent with prior years  we use the with and without approach as described in eitf topic no 
d in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also consistent with prior years  we consider the indirect effects of the windfall deduction on the computation of other tax attributes  such as the r d credit and the domestic production activities deduction  as an additional component of equity 
this incremental tax effect is recorded to additional paid in capital when realized

table of contents net sales increased in compared to principally due to stronger demand from domestic and international satellite operators and domestic cable operators  and sales of our recently introduced products 
in the video processing product line  the sales increase in compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to higher spending across all types of customers except telco 
the increase in the edge and access product lines was principally attributable to an increase of approximately million in sales of vod and video transmission products for deployments for domestic and international cable operators  offset by a decrease of million in sales of lower margin fttp products 
software and other revenue increased in compared to primarily due to sales of recently introduced software products  including products acquired from the acquisitions of entone and rhozet 
service and support revenue  consisting of maintenance agreements  system integration and customer repairs  increased in compared to principally due to an increased customer base 
net sales decreased in compared to principally due to the decrease in the sale of fttp products and third party products to our end customers  delays in the completion of certain projects for international telco customers and decreased spending by domestic cable customers for major digital headend projects 
in the video processing product line  sales of encoder and stream processing products decreased by approximately million in compared to due to lower spending for major digital headend projects by domestic cable companies 
in addition  sales of third party products to end customers decreased by approximately million in compared to the decrease in our net sales in from were partially offset by increases in sales from our edge and access products line 
sales of vod products increased as telcos and cable operators continued to introduce and expand video and other services  primarily in the us and european markets

in  million of expense related to intangibles was included in cost of sales compared to million in we expect to record a total of approximately million in amortization of intangibles in cost of sales in related to acquisitions of entone and rhozet 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to an increase in gross margin  which was partially offset by higher amortization and impairment of intangibles and stock based compensation expense 
the gross margin percentage in compared to was higher primarily due to increased gross margins on video processing products from the introduction of new products and a higher proportion of software and service revenue  which carry higher gross margins than the average gross margins for our products  and lower sales of third party products to our end customers in compared to  sales of which products have significantly lower gross margins than the average gross margin on sales of our products

liquidity and capital resources fiscal year ended december  in thousands  except percentages cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million as of december  cash provided by operations was million in  resulting from net income of million  adjusted for million in non cash charges and a million net change in assets and liabilities 
the non cash charges included depreciation  amortization  write off of acquired in process technology and stock based compensation expense 
the net change in assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts payable primarily from the payment for inventory purchases  a decrease in accrued excess facilities costs  an increase in prepaid expenses primarily from the increase in deferred cost for projects  which was partially offset by a decrease in inventories and an increase in deferred revenue and an increase in accrued liabilities primarily from the provision for the tentative litigation settlement 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities resulted from changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and other liabilities 
we generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
in addition  we usually pay our annual incentive compensation to employees in the first quarter 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  resulting primarily from the net purchase of investments of million  the payment of million of capital expenditure primarily for test equipment  payment of million in merger costs related to the entone technologies  inc acquisition in december  the purchase of a convertible note from entone  inc for million  and a payment of million to rhozet shareholders 
in accordance with the terms of the rhozet acquisition  harmonic paid million to the rhozet option holders in the first quarter of harmonic currently expects capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million during net cash provided by financing activities was million in  resulting primarily from the net proceeds of million received from the issuance of million shares of common stock  proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and the sale of our common stock under our espp  less the repayment of million of the remaining outstanding balance under our term loan facility 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger liabilities 
approximately million of pre merger liabilities remained outstanding at december  and are included in accrued liabilities 
these liabilities represent estimates of c cube s pre merger obligations to various tax 
table of contents authorities in eight countries 
we are working with lsi logic  which acquired c cube s spun off semiconductor business from us in june and assumed its obligations  to settle these obligations  a process which has been underway since the merger in we paid million to satisfy a portion of this liability in january  but are unable to predict when the remaining obligations will be paid  or in what amount 
the full amount of the estimated obligation has been classified as a current liability 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amounts provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
conversely  if the settlements are more than the remaining million pre merger liability balance after the january payments  lsi is obligated to reimburse harmonic 
harmonic has a bank line of credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides for borrowings of up to million that matures on march  in march  harmonic paid in full the outstanding balance of its secured term loan for equipment and canceled its term loan facility as part of the renewal process for the bank line of credit 
as of december   other than standby letters of credit and guarantees  there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit facility and there were no borrowings in or this facility  which was amended and restated in march  contains a financial covenant with the requirement for harmonic to maintain cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of credit extensions  of not less than million 
if harmonic is unable to maintain this cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance or satisfy the affirmative covenant requirement  harmonic would be in noncompliance with the facility 
in the event of noncompliance by harmonic with the covenants under the facility  silicon valley bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the facility which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable if obligations were not repaid 
at december   harmonic was in compliance with the covenants under this line of credit facility 
the march amendment requires payment of approximately  of additional fees if the company does not maintain an unrestricted deposit of million with the bank for consecutive days 
future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  or prime plus for equipment borrowings 
borrowings are payable monthly and are not collateralized 
harmonic s cash and investment balances at december  were million 
as of december   harmonic held approximately million of auction rate securities  or arss 
as of february   we have million invested in arss which are invested in municipal government obligations and preferred securities in closed end mutual funds  and all have a credit rating of aa or better 
through february   auctions for approximately million of these securities were not successful  resulting in our continuing to hold these securities and issuers paying interest at a maximum contractual rate 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that future auctions related to these securities will be unsuccessful in the near term 
unsuccessful auctions will result in our holding these securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been affected 
if the credit rating of the security issuers deteriorates or does not meet our investment criteria  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge or dispose of these securities  possibly at a loss 
excluding arss  at february   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including our bank line of credit facility  will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger liabilities and our expectation that we will pay million to settle the outstanding securities litigation 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations or estimates change or prove inaccurate  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
in addition  we actively review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  as well as conditions in capital markets and the cable and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

harmonic indemnifies some of its suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
there have been no claims for indemnification and  accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at december  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as income tax payable long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
in addition  harmonic has various international branch offices that provide sales support and systems integration services 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of net sales in and of net sales in periodically  harmonic enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to manage exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
harmonic does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had a forward exchange contract to sell euros totaling million that matures within the first quarter of while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investments balance was million 
based on our estimates  a basis points  or  change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investments by approximately million 
auction rate securities harmonic s cash and investment balances at december  were million 
as of december   harmonic held approximately million of auction rate securities  or arss 
as of february   we have million invested in arss which are invested in municipal government obligations and preferred securities in closed end mutual funds  and all have a credit rating of aa or better 
through february   auctions for approximately million of these securities were not successful  resulting in our continuing to hold these securities
