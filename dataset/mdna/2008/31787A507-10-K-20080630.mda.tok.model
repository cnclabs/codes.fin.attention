forward looking statements the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
business overview we are a leading provider of optical subsystems and components that connect local area networks  or lans  storage area networks  or sans  and metropolitan area networks  or mans 
our optical subsystems consist primarily of transceivers which provide the fundamental optical electrical interface for connecting the equipment used in building these networks 
these products rely on the use of digital semiconductor lasers in conjunction with integrated circuit design and novel packaging technology to provide a cost effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable using a wide range of network protocols  transmission speeds and physical configurations over distances of meters to kilometers 
our line of optical components consists primarily of packaged lasers and photodetectors used in transceivers  primarily for lan and san applications and passive optical components used in building mans 
our manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and include integrated circuit design and internal assembly and test capabilities for our optical subsystem products  as well as key components used in those products 
we sell our optical subsystem and component products to manufacturers of storage and networking equipment such as brocade  cisco systems  emc  emulex  hewlett packard company  huawei  ibm and qlogic 
we also provide network performance test systems primarily to original equipment manufacturers such as brocade  emc  emulex  hewlett packard company and qlogic for testing and validating equipment designs 
since october  we have completed the acquisition of ten privately held companies and certain businesses and assets from six other companies in order to broaden our product offerings and provide new sources of revenue  production capabilities and access to advanced technologies that we believe will enable us to reduce our product costs and develop innovative and more highly integrated product platforms while accelerating the timeframe required to develop such products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we allocate revenue to the separate elements based upon each element s fair value as determined by the list price for such element 
we sell our products through our direct sales force  with the support of our manufacturers representatives  directly to domestic customers and indirectly through distribution channels to international customers 
the evaluation and qualification cycle prior to the initial sale for our optical subsystems may span a year or more  while the sales cycle for our network performance test systems is usually considerably shorter 
the market for optical subsystems and components is characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from factors such as industry over capacity  increased competition  the introduction of new products and the growth in unit volumes as manufacturers continue to deploy network and storage systems 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decrease in future periods  although the timing and amount of these decreases cannot be predicted with any certainty 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead  warranty expense  inventory adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory and the amortization of acquired developed technology associated with acquisitions that we have made 
we have been manufacturing our optical subsystem products at our subsidiary in ipoh  malaysia  since fiscal we manufacture vcsels used in our lan san products at our facility in allen  texas 
we manufacture long wavelength fp and certain dfb lasers used in our man and telecom products at our facility in fremont  ca 
we manufacture certain passive components used in our man and telecom products at our facility in shanghai  china 
we conduct manufacturing engineering  supply chain management  quality assurance and documentation control at our facility in sunnyvale  california 
as a result of building a vertically integrated business model  our manufacturing cost structure has become more fixed 
while this can be beneficial during periods when demand is strong  it can be more difficult to reduce costs during periods when demand for our products is weak  product mix is unfavorable or selling prices are generally lower 
while we have undertaken measures to reduce our operating costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our cost of revenues enough to achieve or sustain profitability 
our gross profit margins vary among our product families  and are generally higher on our network test systems than on our optical subsystems and components 
our optical products sold for longer distance man and telecom applications typically have higher gross margins than our products for shorter distance lan and san applications 
our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of overall revenue levels  shifts in product mix  the introduction of new products  decreases in average selling prices and our ability to reduce product costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel  the cost of developing prototypes and fees paid to consultants 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long term success 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to manufacturers representatives  salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and field support activities and other costs associated with the promotion of our products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
acquired in process research and development represents the amount of the purchase price in a business combination allocated to research and development projects underway at the acquired company that had not reached the technologically feasible stage as of the closing of the acquisition and for which we had no alternative future use 
a portion of the purchase price in a business combination is allocated to goodwill and intangibles 
prior to may   goodwill and purchased intangibles were amortized over their estimated useful lives 
subsequent to may   goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but subject to annual impairment testing 
the cost of definite lived intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic life 
costs of such intangibles includes external costs to apply for and maintain our internally developed patents 
impairment charges consist of write downs of the carrying value of certain intangible assets and goodwill arising from various business combinations to their fair value 
restructuring costs generally include termination costs for employees associated with a formal restructuring plan and the cost of facilities or other unusable assets abandoned or sold 
other acquisition costs primarily consist of incentive payments for employee retention included in certain of the purchase agreements of companies we acquired and costs incurred in connection with transactions that were not completed 
other income and expenses generally consist of bank fees  gains or losses as a result of the periodic sale of assets and other than temporary decline in the value of investments 
recent acquisitions acquisition of intersan  inc on may   we completed the acquisition of intersan  inc  a privately held company located in scotts valley  california 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  intersan merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of finisar and the holders of intersan s securities received  shares of finisar common stock having a value of approximately million at the time of the acquisition 
the results of operations of intersan beginning with the closing date of the acquisition and the estimated fair value of assets acquired were included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal acquisition of big bear networks  inc on november   we completed the purchase of certain assets of big bear networks  inc in exchange for a cash payment of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired assets beginning with the closing date of the acquisition and the estimated fair value of assets acquired were included in our consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal acquisition of azna llc on march   we completed the acquisition of azna llc  a privately held company located in wilmington  massachusetts for a purchase price of million  consisting of convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million and cash of million 
the results of operations of azna beginning with the closing date of the acquisition and the estimated fair value of assets acquired were included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal acquisition of kodeos communications  inc on april   we completed the acquisition of kodeos communications  inc  a privately held company located in south plainfield  new jersey for million in cash  with additional consideration of up to million in cash payable to holders of certain equity interests contingent on technical and financial performance 
during fiscal none of the technical or financial performance milestones had been achieved and no additional consideration was paid 
the results of operations of kodeos beginning with the closing date of the acquisition and the estimated fair value of assets acquired were included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures require that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue and operating results  as well as on the value of certain assets  contingent assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of other significant accounting policies 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the fiscal year ended april  compared to prior years 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas r 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april  and included compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  the adoption of sfas r  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the stock based payment awards granted subsequent to april  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards that were granted on or prior to april  was valued under the multiple option approach and will continue to be amortized using the accelerated attribution method 
subsequent to april   compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures 
revenue recognition  warranty and sales returns our revenue recognition policy follows sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
specifically  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  or in related arrangements with the same customer  the arrangement is divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
for units of accounting which include more than one deliverable  we generally recognize all revenue and cost of revenue for the unit of accounting over the period in which the last undelivered item is delivered 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
our standard warranty period usually extends months from the date of sale although it can extend for longer periods of three to five years for certain products sold to certain customers 
our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what actually transpire in the future 
if our actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  costs of revenue will increase in the future 
we also provide an allowance for estimated customer returns  which is netted against revenue 
this provision is based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
if the historical data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where  subsequent to delivery  we become aware of a customer s potential inability to meet its obligations  we record a specific allowance for the doubtful account to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
a material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could result in a material reduction in the estimated amount of accounts receivable that can ultimately be collected and an increase in our general and administrative expenses for the shortfall 
slow moving and obsolete inventories we make inventory commitment and purchase decisions based upon sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past and to fill orders with non standard configurations  we build inventory levels for certain items with long lead times and enter into certain longer term commitments for certain items 
we permanently write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
we periodically discard obsolete inventory 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we use a month demand forecast  and in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of our products  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
significant differences between our estimates and judgments regarding future timing of product transitions  volume and mix of customer demand for our products and actual timing  volume and demand mix may result in additional write offs in the future  or additional usage of previously written off inventory in future periods for which we would benefit from a reduced cost of revenues in those future periods 
investment in equity securities for strategic reasons  we may make minority investments in private or public companies or extend loans or receive equity or debt from these companies for services rendered or assets sold 
our minority investments in private companies are primarily motivated by our desire to gain early access to new technology 
our investments in these companies are passive in nature in that we generally do not obtain representation on the boards of directors 
our investments have generally been part of a larger financing in which the terms were negotiated by other investors  typically venture capital investors 
these investments are generally made in exchange for preferred stock with a liquidation preference that helps protect the underlying value of our investment 
at the time we made our investments  in most cases the companies had not completed development of their products and we did not enter into any significant supply agreements with the companies in which we invested 
in determining if and when a decline in the market value of these investments below their carrying value is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings and cash flows  price multiples  prospects for liquidity and other key measures of performance 
our policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists  such as a the completion of a new equity financing that may indicate a new value for the investment  b the failure to complete a new equity financing arrangement after seeking to raise additional funds or c the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders 
as of april   the carrying value of these investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results at any of the companies in which we hold a minority position could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of these investments 
restructuring accrual during the second quarter of fiscal  we consolidated our sunnyvale facilities into one building and permanently exited a portion of our scotts valley facility 
as a result of these activities  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these restructuring charges included  of miscellaneous costs required to effect the closures and approximately million of non cancelable facility lease payments 
of the million in restructuring charges  million related to our optical subsystems and components segment and million related to our network performance test systems segment 
the facilities consolidation charges were calculated using estimates that were based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources 
as of april    of committed facilities payments remains accrued and is expected to be fully utilized by fiscal goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets our long lived assets include significant investments in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in addition to acquired intangible assets with finite lives  we capitalize external costs  principally legal fees  that we incur to apply for and maintain our internally developed patents 
we amortize these costs on a straight line basis over their expected economic life  generally years 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
we operate two reporting units  optical subsystems and components and network performance test systems 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment would then be measured in the second step 
in which we determine the implied value of goodwill based on the allocation of the estimated fair value determined in the initial step to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
as of the first day of the fourth quarters of fiscal and  we performed the required annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that no impairment charge was required 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal the assessment was completed in late june  in connection with the closing of our fiscal year and concluded that the carrying value of our network performance test systems reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
this conclusion was based  among other things  on the assumed disposition of our netwisdom product line  which had been planned at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
accordingly  in late june  we performed an additional analysis  as required by sfas  which indicated that an impairment loss was probable because the implied fair value of goodwill related to our network performance test systems reporting unit was zero 
as a result  we recorded an estimated impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we will complete our determination of the implied fair value of the affected goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal  which could result in a revision of the estimated charge 
we are required to make judgments about the recoverability of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired or not recoverable 
in order to make such judgments  we are required to make assumptions about the value of these assets in the future including future prospects for earnings and cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we write those assets down to their fair value which is generally determined based on discounted cash flows 
judgments and assumptions about the future are complex  subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including industry and economic trends  our market position and the competitive environment of the businesses in which we operate 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that there had been an impairment in the net carrying value of intangible assets associated with certain products acquired in the acquisition of genoa corporation in april and in the acquisition of transwave fiber inc in may  and we recorded an impairment charge of  related to these assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that there had been an impairment in the net carrying cost of certain intangible assets associated with our internally developed patent portfolio  and  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to those assets 
at april   our investment in goodwill and intangible assets was million and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and their reported amounts  along with net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for income taxes based upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for the undistributed earnings of non united states subsidiaries 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of all foreign corporate subsidiaries accumulated in fiscal and subsequent years 
effective may   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold

revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal sales of optical subsystems and components and network test systems represented and  respectively  of total revenues in fiscal  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal optical subsystems and components revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal sales of products for short distance lan san applications decreased million  or  and sales of products for man and telecom applications increased million  or 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of products for short distance lan san applications was primarily due to a decrease in sales of components used in these applications 
the increase in revenues from the sales of man and telecom products was primarily the result of increased sales of gbps products to existing customers 
network performance test systems revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the introduction during fiscal of several new products for gbps fibre channel applications as oem system manufacturers began to design their product offerings for these higher speed applications and the introduction of products for gbps sas sata applicatons 
amortization of acquired developed technology 
amortization of acquired developed technology  a component of cost of revenues  increased  or  in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the increase reflects the amortization of additional assets as a result of the acquisitions of azna and kodeos which were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the roll off during fiscal of certain fully amortized assets associated with the honeywell and infineon acquisitions 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we recorded a write down of million for obsolete and excess inventory in fiscal and million in fiscal we sold inventory that was written down in previous periods resulting in a benefit of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result  we recognized a net non cash write down of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal manufacturing overhead includes non cash stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal also included in manufacturing expense in fiscal was a charge of million related to personal income taxes that we assumed related to the results of the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices 
excluding the amortization and impairment of acquired developed technology  the net impact of excess and obsolete inventory write downs  stock based compensation expense  and the assumed personal income taxes  gross profit would have been million  or of revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenue  in fiscal the decrease in adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to declines in sales prices for our lan san products as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of azna and kodeos which contributed an additional million in spending in fiscal  of which  million was related to azna purchase related retention payments 
also included in research and development expenses in fiscal were charges of million related to personal income taxes of certain employees that we assumed related to the results of the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices 
research and development expenses include non cash stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the remaining increase of million in research and development expense was primarily due to personnel costs related to spending for the development of new higher data rate transceiver products 
research and development expenses as a percent of revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal excluding the assumed personal income taxes of certain employees and the azna purchase related retention payments  fiscal research and development expenses would have been of revenue 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to personnel related costs added in anticipation of revenue growth in the last half of the fiscal year 
included in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were charges of  related to personal income taxes of certain employees that we assumed related to the results of the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and  related to retention payments as a result of the azna purchase 
sales and marketing expenses include non cash stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal excluding the assumed personal income taxes and the azna purchase related retention payments  fiscal sales and marketing expenses would have been of revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in professional services expense related to the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices  charges of  related to the assumption of personal income taxes  also a result of the investigation  and  related to azna purchase related retention payments 
total professional services expense related to the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal general and administrative expenses include non cash stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal excluding the charges associated with the investigation  general and administrative expenses would have been million or of revenue in fiscal compared to million  or of revenue in fiscal acquired in process research and development 
we recorded no in process research and development  or ipr d  expenses in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the fiscal ipr d charges were related to the fourth quarter acquisitions of azna and kodeos 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to the roll off of certain fully amortized assets during fiscal associated with the acquisition of assets from intersan in the amount of  offset by the additional amortization related to our fiscal acquisitions of azna and kodeos of  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
based on certain indicators of impairment  in the fourth quarter of we reviewed the net carrying value of our internally developed patent costs for impairment and determined that certain patents were impaired and had a fair value of zero 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  based on our annual goodwill impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill related to our network performance test systems reporting unit was impaired and had an estimated implied fair value of zero 
as a result  we recorded an estimated impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of decreasing investment balances and lower interest rates during fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense is primarily related to our convertible subordinated notes due in and interest expense related to these notes was approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  of which  million and million respectively  represented the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature of these notes 
the remaining interest expense in fiscal and consisted primarily of interest on a convertible note issued in connection with the azna acquisition  interest on a bank note  and imputed interest of a financing liability associated with the sale leaseback of a building 
loss on convertible debt exchange 
in fiscal  we exchanged million of our convertible subordinated notes due in for million of new convertible senior subordinated notes also due in among other features  the new notes eliminated a put option that would have allowed the holders to require the redemption of the debt on october  for cash or shares 
as a result of the exchange  we recorded a non cash charge for the extinguishment of the original notes of million in fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  consisted of a net expense of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal other expense primarily consists of non cash amortization of subordinated loan costs which was million in fiscal and million in fiscal also included in fiscal was a net gain of  which was primarily related to a non cash gain associated with marking to fair value the liability for certain stock option modifications and gains on the disposal of abandoned equipment  offset by a loss on the sale of shares and the issuance of a call option on the remaining shares held in a minority investment 
also included in fiscal was a net gain of  which was primarily related to gains on the disposal of abandoned equipment 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the income tax provision in fiscal and is primarily the result of establishing a deferred tax liability to reflect tax amortization of goodwill for which no book amortization has occurred 
the decrease of  was primarily due to the tax effect of the write off of goodwill in our network performance systems reporting unit 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of our future profitability  we have recorded a valuation allowance to offset potential income tax benefits associated with our operating losses 
as a result  we did not record any income tax benefit in either fiscal or there can be no assurance that deferred tax assets subject to the valuation allowance will ever be realized 
cumulative effect of adoption of sfas r 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  r on may   we recorded in fiscal an additional million cumulative benefit from change in accounting principle  net of tax  reflecting the net cumulative impact of estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options as of may  that were previously not included in the determination of historic stock based compensation expense under apb in periods prior to may  comparison of fiscal years ended april  and revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal sales of optical subsystems and components and network test systems represented and  respectively  of total revenues in fiscal  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal optical subsystems and components revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal of the total increase in optical subsystems and components revenues  sales of products for short distance lan san applications increased million  or  and sales of products for man and telecom applications increased million  or 
the increase in revenues from the sale of these products was primarily the result of an increase in the volume of units sold to new and existing customers 
network test systems revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in demand resulting from a product lifecycle transition as oem system manufacturers complete their transition from ghz to ghz models 
amortization of acquired developed technology 
amortization of acquired developed technology  a component of cost of revenues  decreased million  or  in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the decrease reflects the impairment charges recorded in fiscal and as well as the roll off of certain fully amortized assets during fiscal impairment of acquired developed technology 
impairment of acquired developed technology  a component of cost of revenues  decreased from  in fiscal to in fiscal the fiscal charges reflected the write off of technology for the linear optical amplifier product acquired with our acquisition of the assets of genoa corporation in april and technology related to the broadband lightsource product acquired with our acquisition of transwave fiber inc  in may each of these products was discontinued during the second quarter of fiscal gross profit

we expect documentation of this arrangement to be completed in late june or early july we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with the cash expected to be generated from our future operations and borrowings available under our bank credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  unless our payment obligations under our outstanding convertible subordinated notes are accelerated 
see item legal proceedings matters related to historical stock option grant practices trust indenture litigation 
we may  however  require additional financing to fund our operations in the future  including the repayment of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
the objective of fas is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under fas  an entity may irrevocably elect to use fair value to measure eligible items including accounts receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees  and issued debt 
management has elected to not adopt the optional treatment afforded by sfas no 
and therefore the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

we are currently assessing the impact of applying fas to our non financial assets and liabilities on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we place our investments with high credit issuers in short term securities with maturities ranging from overnight up to months or have characteristics of such short term investments 
the average maturity of the portfolio will not exceed months 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when our ownership interest is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
for entities in which we hold greater than a ownership interest  or where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  we use the equity method 
we recorded losses of in fiscal   in fiscal  and million in fiscal  for investments accounted for under the equity method 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired 
there were no impairment losses on these assets during fiscal  or if our investment in a privately held company becomes marketable equity securities upon the company s completion of an initial public offering or its acquisition by another company  our investment would be subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market

due to the relative volume of transactions through these subsidiaries  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure 
in july  china and malaysia changed the system by which the value of their currencies are determined 
both currencies moved from a fixed rate pegged to the us dollar to a managed float pegged to a basket of currencies 
we expect that this will have a minor negative impact on our future costs 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency forwards or options in future years
