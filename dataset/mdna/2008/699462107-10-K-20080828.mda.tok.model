we conduct a significant portion of our operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were from non us operations 
because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our operating results 
for the fiscal year  of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros 
for the fiscal year  of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros 
as a result of the weakening us dollar against the pound sterling and the euro in fiscal year  our revenues and costs increased in fiscal year as compared with the amounts in fiscal year  translated using the fiscal year foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately of our contracts are fixed rate  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flows from these contracts typically consist of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  our clients can terminate their contracts with us upon thirty to sixty days notice or can delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or clinical drug manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the product 

table of contents acquisitions acquisitions are an important component of our business strategy 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
since june   we have completed the following acquisitions clinphone subsequent to the end of fiscal year in august  we completed the acquisition of clinphone  one of the world s leading clinical technology organizations for approximately million  comprised of million for the stock of clinphone and million as repayment of clinphone s existing debt 
we believe that the acquisition of clinphone will advance parexel s position as a clinical technology leader 
biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly demanded technology solutions and expertise to support the full range of clinical development activities while improving the speed and efficiency of clinical programs 
we believe that the combination of complementary capabilities of parexel and clinphone will enable us to provide clients with a more comprehensive suite of clinical information technologies 
apex in september  we acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of taiwan based apex international clinical research co  ltd 
apex and completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of apex in november for a total of approximately million 
the acquisition strengthened our global capabilities  providing clients with a wider range of clinical research service offerings throughout the asia pacific region  including mainland china  hong kong  india  taiwan  singapore  indonesia  south korea  malaysia  thailand  the philippines  new zealand  and australia 
bmr cct in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of behavioral and medical research  llc bmr and caused the transfer of all of the outstanding stock of california clinical trials medical group  inc cct

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved or the susceptibility of such matter to change and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition service revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized as services are performed 
we measure progress for fixed price contracts using the concept of proportional performance based upon a unit based output method 
changes in the scope of work generally result in a renegotiation of contract pricing terms 
renegotiated amounts are not included in net revenues until earned and realization is assured 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
historically  there have not been any significant variations between contract estimates provided to clients and the actual cost incurred that were not recovered from clients 
the majority of our revenue arrangements include multiple deliverables and are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  we allocate the consideration among separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we determine fair value of undelivered items based upon our historic selling prices 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
these conditions are sometimes subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned 
we maintain a provision for losses on receivables based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
in the event that we are unable to collect portions of our outstanding billed or unbilled receivables  there may be a material impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
income taxes parexel s global provision for corporate income taxes is determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

table of contents effective july   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a new methodology by which a company must identify  recognize  measure and disclose in its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has taken or expects to take 
fin requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances 
in addition  fin mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in income tax reporting positions 
interim tax provision calculations are prepared during the year based on estimates 
differences between these interim estimates and the final results for the year could materially impact our effective tax rate and our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we are required under financial interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes in interim periods an interpretation of apb opinion no 
to exclude from our quarterly worldwide effective income tax rate calculation losses in jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recognized 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we are subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities that may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is based on judgment 
we believe we have adequately provided for any uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit below its fair value 
the impairment testing involves determining the fair market value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing that value with the reporting unit s carrying value 
based on this assessment  there have been no required adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill at any of our reporting units 
any future impairment of goodwill could have a material impact to our financial position or our results of operations

on june   we and jpmorgan bank  na amended the credit facility to facilitate our ability to enter into cash pooling arrangements  to increase from million to million the limit on our capital expenditures for fiscal years and  effective april   to cure any default that may have existed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in connection with the capital expenditure covenant set forth in the credit facility  to increase from million to million the limitation on certain permitted investments  and to provide us with the ability to make certain additional investments of up to million the june amendment 
as noted above  the company discovered on june  that it may have been in default under the credit facility for breaching the capital expenditure covenant of the credit facility  with the potential consequences described above 
any such default was cured by the june amendment 
additional lines of credit we have a line of credit with abn amro bank  nv in the amount of euro million 
this line of credit is not collateralized  is payable on demand  and bears interest at a rate ranging between and 
the line of credit may be revoked or canceled by the bank at any time at its discretion 
we primarily entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions with the bank 
at june   we had euro million available under this line of credit 
parexel has other foreign lines of credit with banks totaling million 
these lines of credit are used as overdraft protection and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the lines of credit are payable on demand and are supported by parexel international corporation 
at june   we had million available under these arrangements 
we have a cash pooling arrangement with abn amro bank 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating interest 
each legal entity owned by parexel and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit or debit balance 
therefore  interest income is earned in legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 

table of contents financing needs our primary cash needs are for operating expenses  such as salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting  business development and facilities  and for business acquisitions  capital expenditures and repayment of principal and interest on our borrowings 
our only committed external source of funds is under our credit facility described above 
our principal source of cash is from the performance of services under contracts with our clients 
if we were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increased  our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected see part ii  item a risk factors for further detail

in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas creates a fair value option under which an entity may elect to record certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the election of the fair value option would be made on a contract by contract basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy 
sfas requires an entity to separately disclose the fair value of these items on the balance sheet or in the footnotes to the financial statements and to provide information that would allow the financial statement user to understand the impact on earnings from changes in the fair value

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal year ended june  from operations outside of the us  of which was denominated in pounds sterling and was denominated in euros 
we derived of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal year ended june  from operations outside of the us  of which was denominated in pounds sterling and was denominated in euros 
we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
we may be subjected to foreign currency transaction risk when our foreign subsidiaries enter into contracts or incur liabilities denominated in a currency other than the foreign subsidiary s functional local currency 
to the extent that we are unable to shift the effects of currency fluctuations to our clients  foreign exchange fluctuations as a result of currency exchange losses could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we have a derivative hedging policy to hedge certain foreign denominated accounts receivable and intercompany payables  as well as variable to fixed interest rate swaps 
under this policy  derivatives are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the notional contract amount of these outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts totaled approximately million at june  occasionally  we enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations 
these foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into as economic hedges  but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes as defined under sfas the notional contract amount of these outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was approximately million at june  the potential change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts that would result from a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would be approximately million 
during the fiscal years and  we recorded foreign exchange losses of million and gains of million  respectively 
we acknowledge our exposure to additional foreign exchange risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge program  but quantification of this risk is very difficult to assess at any given point in time 
interest rates our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to the amount of our short term and long term debt and the value of our holdings of any marketable securities 
short term debt was approximately million at june  and approximately million at june  long term debt was approximately million at june  and approximately million at june  in connection with the borrowings under our credit facilities as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  we entered into interest rate exchange agreements to swap  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the mark to market values of both the hedge instrument and underlying debt obligations are recorded as equal and offsetting amounts in interest expense 
we had interest rate exchange agreements with a notional amount of million at june  and million at june
