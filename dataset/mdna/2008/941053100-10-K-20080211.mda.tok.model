item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
industry overview the solid waste industry is a local and highly competitive business  requiring substantial labor and capital resources 
the participants compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and  to a lesser extent  the quality of service  and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees  geographic location and quality of operations 
the solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors  including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance 
many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources  management  operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment 
the consolidation trend has caused solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company owned disposal capacity 
controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves further from collection markets 
generally  the most profitable industry operators are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long term collection contracts 
a vertically integrated operator will benefit from the internalization of waste  which is bringing waste to a company owned landfill  the ability to charge third party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations  and the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling 
executive overview we are an integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in mostly secondary markets in the western and southern us we also provide intermodal services for the rail haul movement of cargo containers in the pacific northwest through a network of five intermodal facilities 
we seek to avoid highly competitive  large urban markets and instead target markets where we can provide either solid waste services under exclusive arrangements  or markets where we can be integrated and attain high market share 
in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements  or where waste disposal is municipally funded or available at multiple municipal sources  we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills 
operating results revenue in grew as internal growth from operations owned at least months and new contracts commenced in was during the year  and acquisitions contributed an additional growth in revenue 
internal growth increased from in due primarily to the commencement of two long term contracts in early  broad based pricing initiatives to offset or recover significant cost increases over the past two years  primarily in fuel and related items  and rising recycled commodity prices 
our local area management achieved pricing growth of in volume growth was for the year  and we anticipate that volume growth will decrease in compared to due both to the anniversary of two new contracts that commenced in early and a more difficult economic environment 
the cost environment remained relatively stable during most of  until the fourth quarter when fuel and insurance costs increased  along with unanticipated costs we incurred associated with a labor disruption in el paso  texas 
margin expansion during the first nine months of more than offset the margin decline experienced during the fourth quarter due to these cost pressures  resulting in our operating income margin for the full year increasing from in  to in this operating income margin exceeded the outlook for that we publicly announced in february free cash flow free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation of free cash flow  increased to million in  from million in free cash flow declined as a percentage of revenue to in  from in  due to a million increase in capital expenditures during  a majority of which was related to the commencement of a new long term collection contract in the first quarter of capital deployment we believe our financial profile and operating performance provide us the flexibility to fund our growth strategy and repurchase stock while remaining within our targeted debt ratios 
during  we deployed approximately million of capital as follows million for capital expenditures  million for acquisitions  and million for common stock repurchases 
despite these outlays  our leverage ratio  as defined in our credit facility  improved to approximately x of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  at year end  from approximately x at year end in june  standard and poor s upgraded our credit rating to investment grade bbb 
we maintain targeted leverage ratios between x and x ebitda 
as a result of the improvement in our capital structure  our board of directors in may authorized a million common stock repurchase program in an effort to rebalance our capital structure 
our board of directors subsequently authorized a million increase to the repurchase program in july and an additional million increase in october depending on acquisition activity  we expect to repurchase approximately million of additional stock under the program in  representing approximately of outstanding shares based on the number of shares outstanding and our stock price as of january  critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the sec  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company 
based on this definition  we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 
insurance liabilities 
we maintain insurance policies for automobile  general  employer s  environmental and directors and officers liability as well as for employee group health insurance  property insurance and workers compensation 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from our third party actuary and third party claims administrator 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
if our judgment and estimates concerning assumptions made in calculating our expected future income tax rates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets and liabilities would change 
based on our net deferred tax liability balance at december   each percentage point change to our expected future income tax rate would change our net deferred tax liability balance and income tax expense by approximately million 
effective january  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires a company to evaluate whether the tax position taken by a company will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
it also provides guidance on how a company should measure the amount of benefit that the company is to recognize in its financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
for additional information regarding the adoption of fin  see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounting for landfills 
we recognize landfill depletion expense as airspace of a landfill is consumed 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills  considering both permitted and expansion airspace 
landfill final capping  closure and post closure liabilities are calculated by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized as depletion expense as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with expansion airspace 
expansion airspace is described below 
landfill development costs depend on future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
we accrue for estimated final capping  closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own  and the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to final capping  closure and post closure costs at other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate or that we may own or operate in the future 
in  we calculated the net present value of our final capping  closure and post closure commitments assuming a inflation rate and a discount rate 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized as depletion expense as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill final capping  closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements could increase our costs related to our landfills  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we own two landfills for which the prior owners are obligated to reimburse us for certain costs we incur for final capping  closure and post closure activities on the portion of the landfill utilized by the prior owners 
we accrue the prior owner s portion of the final capping  closure and post closure obligation within the balance sheet classification of other long term liabilities  and a corresponding receivable from the prior owner in long term other assets 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and expansion airspace  at the landfills that we own and at the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the term of the operating agreement at our operated landfills that have capitalized expenditures 
expansion airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of expansion but is not actually permitted 
expansion airspace that meets certain internal criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace 
the internal criteria we use to determine when expansion airspace may be included as disposal capacity are as follows the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  and we either own the expansion property or it is under an option  purchase  operating or other similar agreement  total development costs  final capping costs  and closure post closure costs have been determined  internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  internal personnel or external consultants are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  and we consider it probable that we will achieve the expansion for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business or political restrictions or similar issues existing that could impair the success of the expansion 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for expansion disposal capacity at our landfills 
in such case  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate acquired assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions  anticipated cash flows and operational performance of our acquired assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could reduce our net worth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   goodwill and intangible assets represented of our total assets 
allocation of acquisition purchase price 
we allocate acquisition purchase prices to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either paid or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
one method we use to estimate the fair value of solid waste companies is based on a multiple of ebitda 
we determine the appropriate ebitda multiple to be used in the valuation of exchange transactions based on factors such as the size of the transaction  the type and location of markets serviced  the existence of long term contracts and the ebitda multiples we have paid in other similar cash based transactions 
stock based compensation 
effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas r for our share based compensation plans 
we previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  all share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
prior periods are not restated 
consistent with prior years  we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation  including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amounts recognized for the year ended december  in the consolidated statements of income within this report 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the years ended december  and  totaled approximately million million net of taxes and million million net of taxes  respectively  and consisted of stock option  restricted stock unit and restricted stock expense 
this expense was included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income within this annual report on form k 
during the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options 
as a result  stock based compensation in periods subsequent to the acceleration was significantly reduced 
a contra equity balance of million in deferred stock compensation on our consolidated balance sheet was reversed as a change in accounting policy upon the adoption of sfas r to additional paid in capital as of january  the excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation were approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
general our solid waste revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing residential  commercial and industrial services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements  municipal contracts or franchise agreements with governmental entities 
our existing franchise agreements and all of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended december   or we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton and or per yard basis for disposing their solid waste at our transfer stations and landfill facilities 
many of our transfer station and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices of our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index  that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs  or that limit increases to less than of the increase in the applicable price index 
our revenues from intermodal services consist mainly of fees we charge customers for the movement of cargo containers between our intermodal facilities 
we also generate revenue from the storage  maintenance and repair of cargo containers and the sale or lease of containers and chassis 
the table below shows for the periods indicated our total reported revenues attributable to services provided in thousands and as percentages of revenues 
years ended december  collection disposal and transfer recycling and other total intercompany elimination cost of operations includes labor and benefits  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  vehicle and equipment maintenance  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment insurance  insurance and employee group health claims expense  third party transportation expense  fuel  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
our significant costs of operations in were labor  third party disposal and transportation  cost of vehicle and equipment maintenance  taxes and fees  insurance and fuel 
we use a number of programs to reduce overall cost of operations  including increasing the use of automated routes to reduce labor and workers compensation exposure  utilizing comprehensive maintenance and health and safety programs  and increasing the use of transfer stations to further enhance internalization rates 
we carry high deductible insurance for automobile liability  property  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability and employer group health claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management  sales force  clerical and administrative employee compensation and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional services  bad debt expense and rent expense for our corporate headquarters 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of equipment and fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depletion expense includes depletion of landfill site costs and total future development costs as remaining airspace of the landfill is consumed 
remaining airspace at our landfills includes both permitted and expansion airspace 
amortization expense includes the amortization of definite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of long term franchise agreements and contracts and non competition agreements  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of certain perpetual rights to provide solid waste collection and transportation services in specified territories  are not amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that may become impaired  such as those that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any pending acquisition or landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
during the year ended december   we capitalized million of interest related to landfill and facility development projects 
at december   we had million in capitalized expenditures relating to pending acquisitions 
at december   we had million in capitalized expenditures for a landfill project in chaparral  new mexico  with respect to which we had obtained a permit to operate the landfill  on july   the supreme court of new mexico ordered the new mexico environment department to conduct an additional limited hearing to consider evidence that landfill opponents claim was wrongfully excluded 
the parties have agreed to reschedule the hearing for july to allow time to explore a possible relocation of the landfill 
if we are not ultimately issued a permit to operate the landfill  we will be required to expense in a future period the capitalized expenditures for this project  less the recoverable value of the applicable property and any other amounts recovered  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations for that period 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
if any impairment indicators are present  a test of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 
as of december  and  there have been no adjustments to the carrying amounts of intangibles resulting from these evaluations 
additionally  we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually 
as a result of performing the tests for potential impairment  we determined that no impairment existed as of december  and  and therefore  there were no write downs to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
at december  and  goodwill and other intangible assets represented and of total assets  respectively

increased recyclable commodity prices and volume during the year ended december   increased revenues by million 
other revenues increased by million during the year ended december  cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to operating costs associated with acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   operating costs incurred to support two long term contracts that commenced in  increased diesel fuel prices  increased labor expenses resulting from employee pay rate increases  increased vehicle and equipment maintenance and repair costs  increased franchise taxes  landfill taxes  third party trucking expenses and increased disposal expenses resulting from higher disposal volumes 
cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to leveraging existing personnel to support increased collection and disposal volumes  and increased prices charged to our customers being higher  on a percentage basis  than the majority of expense increases recognized subsequent to december  this decrease was partially offset by acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   and the commencement of a long term hauling contract in california that commenced in  which had an operating margin below our company average

interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher average borrowing rates on our credit facility  higher average debt balances and a million reduction of interest expense for the year ended december  on our floating rate convertible subordinated notes due  or notes  as a result of the timing of the conversion of the notes into common stock by the note holders after we called the notes for redemption  partially offset by interest income on increased cash balances  and a reduction in our average interest rate on debt incurred outside of our credit facility resulting from completing our offering of our convertible senior notes due  or notes  on march  the higher average borrowing rates on our credit facility were the result of the expiration in the first quarter of of million of interest rate swap agreements with a weighted average fixed borrowing cost of  plus applicable margin  which we were a party to during the year ended december  upon the expiration of these interest rate swaps  we entered into million of new interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed borrowing cost of  plus applicable margin 
other income expense 
other income expense changed to an income total of million for the year ended december   from an expense total of million for the year ended december  other expense in the year ended december   primarily consisted of million of costs associated with the write off of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our notes 
minority interests 
minority interests increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in minority interests was due to increased earnings by our majority owned subsidiaries 
income tax provision 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate during the year ended december   was due to recording adjustments to reduce income tax expense by million  resulting from the reconciliation of our current and deferred income tax liability accounts  the reversal of certain tax contingencies that expired in  and the reconciliation of the income tax provision to the federal tax return  which was filed in september net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income partially offset by increased interest expense and increased income tax expense

during the year ended december   increased prices charged to our customers and increased volume in our existing business resulted in net revenue increases of approximately million and million  respectively 
decreases in intermodal services due to lower cargo volume and lower recyclable commodity prices and volume during the year ended december   decreased revenues by million 
cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to operating costs associated with acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   higher fuel costs resulting from market price changes in fuel and the expiration of our fixed price fuel supply contract in  increased insurance expenses due to increases in both total claims and average settlement rates per claim  increased franchise and landfill taxes  increased labor expenses  increased operating expenses resulting from three new landfills opened during december and january  and increased third party transportation costs and equipment maintenance costs associated with higher collection and disposal volumes 
increases in total claims and our estimated average per claim cost for worker s compensation and automobile liability claims resulted in approximately million of increased insurance expense during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  additionally  during the year ended december   we recorded additional development costs for existing insurance claims of approximately million 
these additional development costs were based on actuarially projected losses on open claims determined by our third party administrator s review and a third party actuarial review of our estimated insurance liability  both of which are updated on a quarterly basis  and reviewed by us 
in  we benefited from a fixed price fuel supply contract that we entered into in late that fixed diesel prices on approximately million gallons purchased during the year 
this amount represented about of our fuel consumption in we estimate that this contract saved us approximately million on a pre tax basis compared to market prices paid during the year ended december  cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to increased fuel costs  increased insurance costs  increased franchise and landfill taxes  third party transportation costs  equipment maintenance costs  and acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   having operating margins below our company average  partially offset by a decrease in disposal expenses resulting from increased internalization of collected waste volumes

interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher average debt balances and increased interest rates on floating rate debt not fixed under our swap agreements  partially offset by interest income on increased cash balances and a million reduction of interest expense on our notes as a result of the timing of the conversion of certain of the notes into common stock by the note holders after we called the notes for redemption 
the notes converted into common stock prior to redemption by us were not entitled to receive interest accrued after may  we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion and redemption of the notes 
other income expense 
other income expense changed to an expense total of million for the year ended december   from an income total of million for the year ended december  other expense in the year ended december   primarily consists of million of costs associated with the write off of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our notes 
minority interests 
minority interests increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in minority interests was due to increased earnings by our majority owned subsidiaries 
income tax provision 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was primarily due to three factors i an increase in our estimated effective current tax rate to and our estimated deferred tax rate to as a result of the geographical apportionment of our state taxes  ii the recognition of an initial deferred tax liability from the impact of implementing a newly enacted texas margin tax  and iii the recognition for tax purposes of a cumulative interest recapture associated with a change in our tax accounting method related to the timing of recognizing landfill closure and post closure expenses 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in tax expense resulting from a detailed reconciliation and adjustment of deferred tax liabilities associated with property and equipment and intangible assets as well as the reserves related to the tax positions for which the statute of limitations expired in the tax rate increases  partially offset by the reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the reconciliation and adjustment of deferred tax liabilities associated with property and equipment and intangible assets  resulted in a million adjustment to our deferred tax account balances and a corresponding increase to income tax expense 
recording an initial deferred tax liability due to the texas margin tax resulted in a million adjustment to our deferred tax account balances and a corresponding increase to income tax expense 
the recognition for tax purposes of a cumulative interest recapture associated with a change in our tax accounting method associated with the timing of recognizing landfill closure and post closure expenses resulted in a permanent million increase to income tax expense 
the reserves related to the tax positions for which the statute of limitations expired in resulted in a million decrease to income tax expense 
loss on discontinued operations 
in the second quarter of  we disposed of a hauling operation in utah and exited a landfill operating contract with a finite term in california 
the amount recorded as loss on discontinued operations for the year ended december  of million consists of the net earnings for these operations 
net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to increased interest expense  increased minority interests expense and the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our notes  partially offset by increased operating income 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions and fixed asset purchases 
we expect that we will also make capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development  landfill closure activities and intermodal facility construction in the future 
we plan to meet our capital needs through various financing sources  including internally generated funds and debt financings 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and equivalents of million 
our working capital decreased million from a positive balance of million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce our indebtedness under our credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
the decrease in our working capital position from december   to december   resulted primarily from a decrease in our cash balances and an increase in current liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable

we intend to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through existing cash  internally generated funds  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
in addition  we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring solid waste collection and disposal businesses 
if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities 
we believe that our credit facility and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future

we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  however  at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
amount of commitment expiration per period unrecorded obligations total less than year to years to years over years operating leases we are party to operating lease agreements as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these lease agreements are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities at competitive  market driven prices 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december   nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we have obtained standby letters of credit as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and financial surety bonds as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these standby letters of credit and financial surety bonds are generally obtained to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december   nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the minority interests holders of a majority owned subsidiary of ours have a currently exercisable put option to require us to complete the acquisition of this majority owned subsidiary by purchasing their minority ownership interests for fair market value 
the put option calculates the fair market value of the subsidiary based on its current operating income before depreciation and amortization  as defined in the put option agreement 
the put option does not have a stated termination date 
at december   the minority interests holders pro rata share of the subsidiary s fair market value is estimated to be worth between million and million 
because the put is calculated at fair market value  no amounts have been accrued relative to the put option 
in the event the minority interests holders elect to exercise the put option  we intend to fund the transaction using borrowings from our credit facility 
from time to time we evaluate our existing operations and their strategic importance to us 
if we determine that a given operating unit does not have future strategic importance  we may sell or otherwise dispose of those operations 
although we believe our operations would not be impaired by such dispositions  we could incur losses on them 
new accounting pronouncements for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
free cash flow we are providing free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  because it is widely used by investors as a valuation and liquidity measure in the solid waste industry 
this measure should be used in conjunction with gaap financial measures 
management uses free cash flow as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities plus proceeds from disposal of assets and excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation  plus or minus change in book overdraft  less capital expenditures for property and equipment and distributions to minority interest holders 
other companies may calculate free cash flow differently 
our free cash flow for the years ended december  and  is calculated as follows in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities change in book overdraft plus proceeds from disposal of assets plus excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation less capital expenditures for property and equipment less distributions to minority interest holders free cash flow inflation other than volatility in fuel prices  inflation has not materially affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business 
however  competitive pressures or delays in the timing of rate increases under our contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  especially if cost increases  such as recent increases in the price of fuel  exceed the average rate of inflation 
management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities 
seasonality based on historic trends  we expect our operating results to vary seasonally  with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter  higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters 
we expect the fluctuation in our revenues between our highest and lowest quarters to be approximately to 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall  winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in the us in addition  some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months 
adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities  resulting in higher labor and operational costs 
greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected waste  resulting in higher disposal costs  which are calculated on a per ton basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and prices of certain commodities 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
at december   our derivative instruments consisted of nine interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the applicable notional amounts of our variable rate debt as follows dollars in thousands date entered notional amount fixed interest rate paid variable interest rate received effective date expiration date september month libor february february september month libor march march december month libor june june november month libor february february november month libor february february november month libor february february november month libor march march november month libor june june november month libor june june plus applicable margin 
all the interest rate swap agreements are considered highly effective as cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt  and we apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive hedge positions and all other debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the unhedged floating rate balances owed at december  and  of million and million  respectively  including floating rate debt under our credit facility  various floating rate notes payable to third parties and floating rate municipal bond obligations 
a one percent increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  and  would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million and million  respectively 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations 
although fuel and energy costs account for a relatively small portion of our total revenues  the market price of diesel fuel is unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly 
we purchase all of our fuel at market prices 
a significant increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins 
a per gallon increase in the price of fuel over a one year period would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing operations and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
certain of our municipal recycling contracts in the state of washington specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
if the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
in the event of a decline in recycled commodity prices  a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the prices that were in effect at december  and would have had a million and million impact on revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively
