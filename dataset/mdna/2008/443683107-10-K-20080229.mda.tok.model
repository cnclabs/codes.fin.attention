item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with hudson city bancorp s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in item  and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document 
executive summary we continue to focus on our traditional thrift business model by growing our franchise through the origination and purchase of one to four family mortgage loans and funding this loan production with increased borrowings and growth in deposit accounts 
we opened eight new branches during  increasing our total footprint to branches 
in addition  we have plans to open three branches in fairfield county  connecticut  three branches in new york in suffolk county and richmond county and two branches in new jersey in ocean county and middlesex county 
we expect to open these branches in our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which  in part  is a direct result of the market interest rate environment 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  primarily mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  interest bearing transaction deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve  the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet  and the prepayment rates on our mortgage related assets 
our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates  credit quality  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
our results are also affected by the market price of our stock  as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans is related to the current price of our common stock 
the federal open market committee of the federal reserve bank fomc decreased the overnight lending rate by basis points to during the second half of and continued to decrease the rate by an additional basis points during the first quarter of as a result  short term market interest rates decreased 
longer term market interest rates also decreased  but at a slower pace than the short term interest rates and  as a result  the yield curve steepened 
however  competitive pricing pressures prevented us from lowering our deposit costs to the same extent as the decreases in the yield curve 
as a result  our net interest rate spread and net interest margin decreased during net income increased for to million as compared to million for basic and diluted earnings per share for were and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  for our return on average stockholders equity was for  as compared to in the increase in the return on average equity is due primarily to decreases in average stockholders equity due primarily to our stock repurchase program and cash dividend payments 
our return on average assets for was as compared to for the decrease in the return on average assets reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads during net interest income increased to million due primarily to the overall growth in our balance sheet 
our total average interest earning assets increased for the year ended december   while the yields over those same periods increased basis points 
our total average interest bearing page 
table of contents liabilities increased  for the year ended december  and the average cost increased basis points 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for we did not record a provision for loan losses during the provision for loan losses reflects the risks inherent in our loan portfolio due to decreases in real estate values in our lending markets  the increase in non performing loans and the overall growth of our loan portfolio 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  as compared to at december  total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in net occupancy expense and a million increase in compensation and benefits expense 
we have been able to grow our assets by to billion at december  from billion at december   by originating and purchasing mortgage loans and purchasing mortgage backed securities 
loans increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  this increase is a result of our continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one to four family mortgage loans in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
during  we purchased billion of loans and originated billion of loans 
we have been able to increase our origination of loans as a result of the acquisition of sound federal and the expansion of our mortgage broker network 
the acquisition of sound federal has given us a presence in westchester county  new york and fairfield county  connecticut 
the connecticut market in particular has provided strong loan growth and is our second largest county for loan production 
total securities increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in securities was primarily due to purchases of mortgage backed securities of billion  partially offset by principal collections on mortgage backed securities billion 
the increase in our total assets was funded primarily by an increase in borrowings as well as by customer deposits 
borrowed funds increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  during  many of our competitors sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased  making time deposits a more expensive method of raising funds 
as a result  we increased our level of borrowed funds  which we believed to be a more cost effective alternative in the current interest rate environment 
deposits increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in deposits was attributable to growth in our time deposits and money market accounts 
the increase in these accounts was a result of our competitive pricing strategies that focused on attracting these types of deposits as well as customer preferences for time deposits rather than other types of deposit accounts 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during  our total assets increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  loans increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  due to continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
for  we purchased one to four family first mortgage loans of billion and originated mortgage loans and other loans of billion  compared with purchases of billion and originations of billion for the purchases of mortgage loans during allowed us to page 
table of contents continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model 
our first mortgage loan originations and purchases were substantially in one to four family mortgage loans 
approximately of mortgage loan originations were variable rate loans 
substantially all purchased mortgage loans were fixed rate loans since variable rate loans available for purchase are typically outside of our defined geographic parameters and include features  such as option arm s  that do not meet our underwriting standards 
at december   fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with at december  total mortgage backed securities increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  this increase was due primarily to purchases of billion  all of which are mortgage backed securities issued by a us government agency or us government sponsored enterprise and substantially all of which were variable rate instruments 
at december   variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for of our portfolio compared with at december  the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities is a component of our interest rate risk management strategy 
since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans  the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments 
federal funds sold increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase was due to liquidity that was made available to fund asset purchases entered into at the end of with january settlement dates 
accrued interest receivable increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase was due primarily to increased balances in loans and investments 
the million decrease in other assets was primarily due to a decrease of million in deferred tax assets 
total liabilities increased billion  or  to billion at december  compared with billion at december  borrowed funds increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in borrowed funds was the result of billion of new borrowings at a weighted average rate of  partially offset by repayments of billion with a weighted average rate of 
the new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates ranging from one to five years 
the additional borrowed funds were utilized as a more cost effective alternative to time deposits  which had become a relatively expensive method of raising funds in the current interest rate environment  as many of our competitors sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased 
these borrowed funds were used primarily to fund our asset growth 
borrowed funds at december  were comprised of billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and billion of federal home loan bank advances 
total deposits increased billion  or  during  due primarily to a billion increase in total time deposits  and a million increase in our money market accounts 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts  due primarily to customers shifting deposits to short term time deposits 
we experienced significant competitive pressure during with respect to the pricing of short term deposits in the new york metropolitan area 
the increase in time deposits reflects our competitive pricing of these deposits and customer preference for short term time deposits

table of contents other liabilities increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase is the result of an increase in accrued interest payable on our deposits and borrowings of million and an increase in accrued taxes of million  partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
at december   due to brokers amounted to million and represented securities purchased in with settlement dates in total stockholders equity decreased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease was primarily due to repurchases of  shares of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of million and cash dividends paid to common stockholders of million 
these decreases to stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of million and a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended december  the accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december  includes a million after tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale million pre tax 
we invest primarily in mortgage backed securities issued by ginniemae  fanniemae and freddiemac  as well as us government and agency securities 
these securities account for of total securities 
the company does not purchase unrated or private label mortgage backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub prime loans 
certain securities in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios had unrealized losses 
these unrealized losses were caused by increases in market yields subsequent to purchase and are not attributable to credit quality concerns 
there were no debt securities past due or securities for which the company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security 
because the company has the intent and the ability to hold securities with unrealized losses until a market price recovery which  for debt securities may be until maturity  the company did not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december  represented an improvement from the accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december  reflecting a net unrealized gain on securities available for sale as compared to a net unrealized loss at december   as a result of lower market interest rates 
as of december    shares were available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase programs 
at december   our stockholders equity to asset ratio was compared with at december  for  the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was compared with for the year the lower equity to assets ratios reflect our strategy to grow assets  repurchase our common stock and pay dividends 
our book value per share  using the period end number of outstanding shares  less purchased but unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares and less purchased but unvested recognition and retention plan shares  was at december  and at december  our tangible book value per share  calculated by deducting goodwill and the core deposit intangible from stockholders equity  was as of december  and at december  analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities  such as time deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them

table of contents average balance sheet 
the following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for   and the table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
we derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
we derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated 
interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields 
yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and therefore have a zero yield 
the yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan origination fees and costs  and purchase premiums and discounts that are amortized or accreted to interest income

interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income increased million  or  to billion for as compared to billion for the increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a billion  or  increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to billion for as compared to billion for the increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to for from for the comparable period in interest and fees on first mortgage loans increased million to billion for as compared to million for this increase was primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to billion for as compared to billion for  which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio 
the increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a nine basis point increase in the weighted average yield to  reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of slightly rising intermediate and long term market interest rates during the first half of interest income on consumer and other loans increased million to million for as compared to million for  primarily due to a million increase in the average balance of consumer and other loans to million and an increase of basis points in the weighted average yield to 
interest income on mortgage backed securities increased million to million for as compared to million for this increase was due primarily to a billion increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities to billion 
the increase in income was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average yield to for as compared to for the increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities was due to purchases of variable rate mortgage backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans  the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments 
the increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio as well as the repricing of securities in the existing portfolio 
dividends on fhlb stock increased million to million for as compared to million for this increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of fhlb stock to million and a basis point increase in the average dividend yield to for as compared to for page 
table of contents interest on investment securities decreased million to million during as compared to million for this decrease was due to a million decrease in the average balance of investment securities to billion 
the decrease in interest on investment securities was partially offset by a basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased million  or  to billion for from billion for this increase was due primarily to an billion  or  increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to billion for compared with billion for the increase in total interest expense was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to for as compared to for this increase in total interest bearing liabilities was used to fund asset growth 
the increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and a shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits as well as the growth and re pricing of our deposits and borrowings during the higher short term interest rate environment experienced during the second half of and first half of interest expense on our time deposit accounts increased million to million for as compared to million for this increase was due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost to and a billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts to billion as compared to billion for interest expense on money market accounts increased million due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost to  reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product  and a million increase in the average balance to billion 
the increases in the average balance of time deposits and money market accounts reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the branches added to our network during and as well as deposit growth in existing branches 
interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts decreased million to million for as compared to million for primarily due to a million decrease in the average balance to billion from billion 
this decrease was due primarily to customer preferences for short term time deposit products 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased million to million for as compared to million for this increase was primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to billion and a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds to for as compared to for we faced significant competition for time deposits from many of our competitors who  during the second half of  sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased 
as a result  we increased our level of borrowed funds  which we believed to be a more cost effective alternative in the current interest rate environment 
the increase in borrowed funds was used to fund the growth in interest earning assets 
the increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with higher interest rates than existing borrowings that were called 
substantially all of our borrowings are callable at the discretion of the issuer 
as a result  as interest rates decrease  these borrowings will probably not be called and therefore will not reprice until maturity or until market interest rates increase 
as interest rates increase  these borrowings would likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would be at higher rates than the called borrowing 
these call features are generally quarterly  after an initial non call period of three months to five years from the date of borrowing 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for compared with million for our net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for page 
table of contents from for our net interest margin decreased basis points to from for the same respective periods 
the decrease in our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread was primarily due to the larger increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities compared with the increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
changes in market interest rates during resulted in a return to a positively sloped yield curve 
however  competitive pricing pressures due in part to the liquidity crisis in the credit markets  prevented us from lowering our deposit costs to the same extent as the decreases in the yield curve and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits also contributed to the increase in the average cost of deposits 
in addition  while market interest rates decreased  our callable borrowings were not called and therefore did not reprice to lower rates 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for the year we did not record a provision for loan losses for the same period in the allowance for loan losses amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
we recorded our provision for loan losses during based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the amount of non performing loans  which increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  see critical accounting policies allowance for loan loses 
due to the nature of our homogenous loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed substantially on a pooled basis 
a component of our methodology includes assigning potential loss factors to the payment status of multiple residential loan categories with the objective of assessing the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
we also consider growth in the loan portfolio in our determination of the allowance for loan losses 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history  delinquency trends  the results of our foreclosed property transactions and market conditions 
we use this systematic methodology  as a tool  together with qualitative analysis performed by our asset quality committee to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located  changes in the trend of non performing loans  the current state of the local and national economy  changes in interest rates  the results of our foreclosed property transactions and loan portfolio growth 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties 
our loan growth was primarily concentrated in one to four family mortgage loans with loan to value ratios of less than 
the value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions 
as part of our estimation of the allowance for loan losses  we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations 
based on our analysis of the data for  we concluded that home values in the northeast quadrant of the united states  where most of our lending activity occurs  have deteriorated since as evidenced by reduced levels of sales  increasing inventories of houses on the market  declining house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market 
in addition  general economic conditions in the united states have also worsened as evidenced by slower economic growth 
however  the decline in the economic and housing conditions in the new york metropolitan area has not been as severe as the rest of the country 
approximately of our total loans are in the new york metropolitan area and are located throughout the remaining states in the northeast quadrant of the united states 
with respect to our non performing loans  approximately are in the new york metropolitan area and are located throughout the remaining states in the northeast quadrant of the united states 
we considered these trends page 
table of contents in market conditions in determining the provision for loan losses also taking into account the continued growth of our loan portfolio 
the second half of has been highlighted by significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital marketplaces 
this turbulence has been attributable to a variety of factors  including the fallout associated with the sub prime mortgage market 
one aspect of this fallout has been significant deterioration in the activity of the secondary residential mortgage market and the lack of available liquidity that previously existed through securitization transactions 
the disruptions have been exacerbated by the acceleration of the decline of the real estate and housing market 
we continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio 
sub prime mortgage lending  which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market  is not a market in which we participate 
we continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards 
however  based on our evaluation of the foregoing factors  and in recognition of the recent increases in non performing loans and net loan charge offs  our analyses indicated that a provision for loan losses was warranted during at december   first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for of total loans 
fixed rate mortgage loans represent of our first mortgage loans 
fixed rate loans possess less inherent credit risk since loan payments do not change in response to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we do not originate or purchase loans with payment options  negative amortization loans or sub prime loans 
we determined that a provision for loan losses was not required for the fiscal year ended december  based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considered a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including low levels of charge offs 
see critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses for a description of this methodology 
net charge offs amounted to  during charge offs were at very low levels as a result of our lending practices and the concentration of one to four family first mortgage loans in our portfolio 
as a result of our underwriting policies  our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans 
when a loan becomes delinquent  the borrower will usually sell the property to satisfy the loan rather than go to foreclosure 
since substantially all of our non performing loans are secured by residential real estate with adequate collateral  we determined that the ratio of the allowance to non performing loans was appropriate 
at december   first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for of total loans 
fixed rate mortgage loans represented of our first mortgage loans 
the value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions 
during  we monitored changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations 
based on our analysis of the data for  we concluded that the values of homes in our market areas were stable 
as a result  we believe that our loans were adequately collateralized  especially given the loan to value ratios that our underwriting guidelines require at origination 
non performing loans amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  non performing loans at december  included million of one to four family first mortgage loans as compared to million at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared with at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared with at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was at december  compared with at december  as a result of our underwriting policies  our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity  at the time of origination  in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans 
at december   our non performing mortgage loans had an average loan to value ratio of approximately based on the appraised value at the time of origination 
it has been our experience that when a loan becomes page 
table of contents delinquent  the borrower will usually sell the property to satisfy the loan rather than go to foreclosure 
since substantially all of our non performing loans are secured by residential real estate with adequate collateral at the time of origination  we determined that the ratio of the allowance to non performing loans was adequate 
net charge offs amounted to  for as compared to  for the increase in charge offs was related to non performing residential loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral 
see item business asset quality 
at december  and  loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan amounted to million and million  respectively 
based on this evaluation  we established an allowance for loan losses of  for loans classified as impaired at december  we had no allowance for loan losses for impaired loans at december  although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change

non interest income 
total non interest income was million for compared with million for the increase in non interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth 
non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in net occupancy expense and a million increase in compensation and benefits expense 
the increase in compensation and benefits expense was due to an increase of million in salary expense  a million increase in stock benefit plan expense and a million decrease in expense related to the esop restoration plan 
the increase in salary expense was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees to staff our new branches as well as normal salary increases 
the increase in stock benefit plan expense was primarily due to stock option grants which were made during and the option grants which were made in july during  two former executives ceased to participate in the esop restoration plan  resulting in the decreased expense related to the plan 
the increase in net occupancy expense and other non interest expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion  including the addition of branches from the sound federal acquisition in july as well as growth in the existing franchise 
our efficiency ratio was for each of the years ended december  and our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for was as compared to for income taxes 
income tax expense increased million to million for  from million for our effective tax rate for was compared with for the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the new jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company

the increase in total interest expense was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to for the year compared with for the year the increase in the average cost reflected the growth and re pricing of our interest bearing liabilities during the rising short term interest rate environment experienced in interest expense on borrowed funds increased million primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds 
the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth 
the increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the new borrowings with a higher rate than the existing borrowings

the million increase in interest expense on our time deposit accounts reflected a basis point increase in the weighted average cost  due to the rising short term market interest rate environment  and a billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts 
the million increase in interest expense on our money market accounts primarily reflected an increase in the weighted average cost of basis points  reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product 
the million decrease in interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts was primarily due to a billion decrease in the average balance  reflecting shifts to time deposit products 
time deposits accounted for of the average balance of interest bearing deposits compared to during we intend to continue to fund future asset growth using borrowed funds and customer deposits as our primary sources of funds 
we intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to pay competitive  but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year compared with million for the year this increase primarily reflected the investment of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion over the course of a full year and our balance sheet growth initiatives 
the increase due to our growth was partially offset by an increase in the costs of our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
our net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for from for and our net interest margin decreased basis points to for from for market interest rates resulted in an inverted us treasury yield curve during this market interest rate scenario has had a negative impact on our results of operations and our net interest margin as the yields on our interest earning assets have increased far less than the costs of our interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  our interest bearing liabilities will reprice to current market interest rates faster than the yields earned on our interest earning assets 
the increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities reflected the rising short term interest rate environment  affecting both our deposits and borrowed funds  and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits 
our net interest margin is likely to decrease further if the yield curve remains inverted in provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to the inclusion of sound federal s allowance for loan losses as a result of the acquisition 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was at december  compared with at december  we did not record a provision for loan losses during we did record a provision of  during net charge offs for the year were  compared with net recoveries of  for non performing loans  defined as non accruing and accruing loans delinquent days or more increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase reflected an increase in the number of non performing loans to loans at december  from loans at december  at december   our largest loan delinquent days or more was a construction loan with a balance of million that has become current subsequent to december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared with at december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans was at december  compared with at december  page 
table of contents although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
see critical accounting policies 
non interest income 
total non interest income decreased million to million for from million for the decrease in non interest income primarily reflected the million decrease in gains on securities transactions as there were minimal realized gains losses from sales of securities that occurred during non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to increases of million in compensation and employee benefits expense  million in net occupancy expense  and million in other non interest expense 
the increase in compensation and employee benefits expense primarily reflected a million increase in the expense related to our employee stock ownership plan  as a result of increases in our stock price 
the increase also reflected the expense related to stock options that amounted to million during the increase in net occupancy expense is the result of our branch expansion and the addition of branches from sound federal in july the increases in the other categories of non interest expense are due to an increase in professional services of million  operating expenses for new branches and increased costs related to our growth 
our efficiency ratio was for compared with for our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for was compared with for income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared with million for our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared with for the year the increase in income tax expense reflected the increase in income before income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan and security purchases  deposit withdrawals  repayment of borrowings and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  the maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds  and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the receipt of these sources of funds 
our membership in the fhlb provides us with access to additional sources of borrowed funds  which is generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned 
we also have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time  depending on market conditions 
our ability to access liquidity  as well as our capital levels  has allowed us to pursue our growth strategy 
our investment policy provides that we shall maintain a primary liquidity ratio  which consists of investments in cash  cash in banks  federal funds sold  securities with remaining maturities of less than five years and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities repricing within one year  in an amount equal to at least of total deposits and short term borrowings 
at december   our primary liquidity ratio was compared with at december  page 
table of contents our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans  the purchase of mortgage backed securities  and the purchase of investment securities 
these activities are funded primarily by borrowings  deposit growth and principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
we originated billion and purchased billion of loans during as compared to originations of billion and purchases of billion during purchases of mortgage backed securities during were billion as compared to billion during the increase in mortgage loan purchases and originations and the purchases of mortgage backed securities reflected the growth initiatives we have employed in recent periods 
during  principal repayments on loans totaled billion as compared to billion for principal payments on mortgage backed securities amounted to billion and billion for those same respective periods 
these increases in principal repayments were due primarily to the growth of the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios 
maturities and calls of investment securities amounted to billion during compared with maturities and calls totaling million during the increase in the maturities and calls of investment securities reflected slightly lower short and intermediate term market interest rates during that resulted in an increase in call activity 
as part of the membership requirements of the fhlb  we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of fhlb common stock based on our asset size or our borrowings from the fhlb 
during  we purchased a net additional million of fhlb common stock compared with million during our primary financing activities consist of gathering deposits  engaging in wholesale borrowings  repurchases of our common stock and the payment of dividends 
total deposits increased billion during as compared to billion for this increase reflects our growth strategy including branch offices added as part of the sound federal acquisition as well as growth in the existing franchise 
deposit flows are typically affected by the level of market interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  the volatility of equity markets  and other factors 
time deposits scheduled to mature within one year were billion at december  we anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment 
based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing interest rate 
we also used wholesale borrowings to fund our investing and financing activities 
new borrowings totaled billion  partially offset by billion in principal repayments of borrowed funds 
at december   we had billion of callable borrowed funds that have contractual call dates within one year and with a weighted average rate of 
we anticipate that million of these borrowings are likely to be called based on current market interest rates 
we anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate  or using funds generated by deposit growth 
cash dividends paid during were million 
during  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
at december   there remained  shares to be purchased under existing stock repurchase programs

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations hudson city is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements  which occur in the normal course of our business  to meet the credit needs of our customers and the growth initiatives of the bank 
these arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans  and to purchase mortgage backed securities 
we are also obligated under a number of non cancelable operating leases 
the following table summarizes contractual obligations of hudson city by contractual payment period  as of december  payments due by period less than one year to three years to more than contractual obligation total one year three years five years five years in thousands mortgage loan originations mortgage loan purchases mortgage backed security purchases operating leases total commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately days and other termination clauses 
since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

r 
the eitf reached a consensus that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified nonvested equity shares  nonvested equity share units  and outstanding equity share options should be recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the amount recognized in additional paid in capital for the realized income tax benefit from dividends on those awards should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies on share based payment awards 
unrealized income tax benefits from dividends on equity classified employee share based payment awards should be excluded from the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential future tax deficiencies 
the accounting treatment of the income tax benefits from these dividends would be applied on a prospective basis

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements of hudson city bancorp have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  commonly referred as gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our financial results 
in addition  note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses  the measurement of stock based compensation expense and the measurement of the funded status and cost of our pension and other post retirement benefit plans involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially 
these critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management  and are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and our board of directors 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  under which we are required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at december  we are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses  as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at december  as a result of our lending practices  we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio  we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  generally  and a decline in real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions 
we consider these trends in market conditions in determining the allowance for loan losses 
we consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at a level of probable and estimable losses given current economic conditions  interest rates and the composition of our portfolio 
page 
table of contents due to the nature of our loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed primarily on a pooled basis 
each month we categorize the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type one to four family  multi family  commercial  etc  loan source originated or purchased and payment status ie  current or number of days delinquent 
loans with known potential losses are categorized separately 
we assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history  delinquency trends  portfolio growth and the status of the regional economy and housing market  in order to ascertain that the loss factors cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the portfolio 
we use this analysis  as a tool  together with principal balances and delinquency reports  to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located  changes in the trend of non performing loans  the results of our foreclosed property transactions  the current state of the local and national economy  changes in interest rates and loan portfolio growth 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income 
we charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
we establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends  the allowance for loan loss analysis  the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance  loan portfolio growth  us generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory guidance 
we apply this process and methodology in a consistent manner and we reassess and modify the estimation methods and assumptions used in response to changing conditions 
hudson city defines the population of potential impaired loans to be all non accrual construction  commercial real estate and multi family loans 
impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows 
smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  are specifically excluded from the impaired loan portfolio 
we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels 
additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
stock based compensation we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards for all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  in accordance with sfas no 
r 
for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service was not rendered as of january   the recognition of the cost of employee services is based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosures 
we granted performance based stock options in and that vest if certain financial performance measures are met 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we assess the probability of achieving these financial performance measures and recognize the cost of these performance based grants if it is probable that the financial performance measures will be met 
this probability assessment is subjective in nature and may change over the assessment period for the performance measures 
we estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free page 
table of contents interest rate and expected option term 
these assumptions are based on our analysis of our historical option exercise experience and our judgments regarding future option exercise experience and market conditions 
these assumptions are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
the black scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets 
the per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction of changes in the expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees  including retired employees hired on or before july  who have met other eligibility requirements of the plans 
we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r as of december  this statement requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial condition an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize  in comprehensive income  changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial condition will be effective for the company as of december  the company s measurement date will not change at this effective date 
we provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation 
the most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations  and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements 
a lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense  while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense 
the discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans 
we compare this rate to certain market indices  such as long term treasury bonds  or the moody s or merrill lynch bond indices  for reasonableness 
a discount rate of was selected for the december  measurement date and the expense calculation 
for our pension plan  we also assumed a rate of salary increase of for future periods 
this rate is comparable to actual salary increases experienced over prior years 
we assumed a return on plan assets of for future periods 
we actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years 
the actual return on plan assets was for for our post retirement benefit plan  the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for was 
the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the premium level 
we monitor these rates in relation to the current market interest rate environment and update our actuarial analysis accordingly 
page 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general as a financial institution  our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
our net income is primarily based on net interest income  and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those that possess a short term to maturity 
the difference between rates on the yield curve  or the shape of the yield curve  impacts our net interest income 
during the second half of  short term interest rates decreased at a faster pace than intermediate and long term market interest rates resulting in a return to a positively sloped yield curve during the second half of due to our investment and financing decisions  the more positive the slope of the yield curve  that is the greater the increase in the interest rates in the longer maturity periods  the more favorable the environment is for our ability to generate net interest income 
our interest bearing liabilities generally reflect movements in short and intermediate term rates  while our interest earning assets  a majority of which has initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year  generally reflect movements in intermediate and long term interest rates 
a positive slope to the yield curve allows us to invest in interest earning assets at a wider spread to interest bearing liabilities 
the impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to differences in the timing of the placement of items on our balance sheet 
the timing of the placement of interest earning assets on our balance sheet generally lag the current market rates by to days due to normal commitments periods to settlement date 
in contrast  the placement of interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet generally time market interest rates as we generally fund purchases at the time of settlement 
during a period of decreasing interest rates  as was experienced during the second half of  this timing difference should have a positive impact on our net interest income in future periods 
also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment and call activity on our interest sensitive assets 
the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  availability of credit  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition 
generally  the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets  as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate 
prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate  thus  as market interest rates increase  prepayment rates tend to decrease 
prepayment rates on our mortage related assets have been relatively stable during  even during the last quarter of when market interest rates decreased 
we believe the lack of acceleration of the prepayment rate on these assets reflected the limited availability of credit during this time 
calls of investment securities and borrowed funds are also impacted by the level of market interest rates 
calls of investment securities are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate  meaning as rates decrease the likelihood of a security being called would increase 
the level of call activity generally affects the yield earned on these assets  as the payment received on the security would be page 
table of contents reinvested at the prevailing lower market interest rate 
during the last quarter of we saw an increase in call activity on our investment securities as market interest rates decreased 
the likelihood of a borrowed funds being called is directly related to the current market interest rates  meaning the higher the rates go the more likely the borrowing would be called 
the level of call activity generally affects the cost of our borrowed funds  as the call of a borrowing would necessitate the re borrowing of the funds at the higher current market interest rate 
during the last quarter of we experienced a decrease in calls of our borrowings as market interest rates decreased 
management of interest rate risk the primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts  determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan  the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
we seek to manage our asset liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products 
this committee consists of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer and other senior officers of the institution as required 
the asset liability committee presents periodic reports to the board of directors at its regular meetings and  on a quarterly basis  presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity 
historically  our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans 
our growth in variable rate mortgage related assets has helped reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability  as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase 
however  the prevailing interest rate environment  and the desires of our customers  has resulted in a demand for long term hybrid and fixed rate first mortgage loans 
this may have an adverse impact on our net interest income  particularly in a rising interest rate environment 
in the past several years  we have been originating a larger percentage of variable rate assets in order to better manage our interest rate risk 
included in variable rate loans and securities are loans or securities with a contractual annual rate adjustment after an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years 
these variable rate instruments are more rate sensitive  given the potential interest rate adjustment  than the long term fixed rate investments that we have traditionally held in our portfolio 
variable rate products constituted of loan originations  of loan purchases and of mortgage backed security purchases made during the year in aggregate  of our mortgage related asset originations and purchases had variable rates 
of the growth in our total mortgage related assets  was due to growth in our variable rate products 
page 
table of contents the strategy to originate and purchase a larger percentage of variable rate assets has lowered our percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets to at december  from at december  notwithstanding the decrease in the percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets  our fixed rate interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these interest earning assets would not reprice to current market interest rates as fast as the interest rates on our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds 
the strategy to originate a higher percentage of variable rate instruments may also have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net interest margin as variable rate interest earning assets generally have initial interest rates lower than alternative fixed rate investments 
in  we intend to originate and purchase similar percentages to of variable rate mortgage related assets 
our primary source of funds has traditionally been deposits  consisting primarily of time deposits and interest bearing demand accounts and borrowings 
our deposits have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio and borrowed funds 
the borrowings are generally long term to maturity  in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk 
these long term borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment 
we intend to continue to grow our borrowed funds  as part of our interest rate risk management strategy with new borrowings having maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of one to five years 
further  over the past year  we increased our level of borrowed funds  which we believe to be a more cost effective alternative to time deposits in the prevailing interest rate environment 
if we experience a significant rising interest rate environment where interest rates increase above the interest rate for the borrowings  these borrowings will likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would likely increase 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
our real estate loan portfolio  the majority of which is located in new jersey  new york and connecticut  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
we do not own any trading assets 
we did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps during the year and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at december  cash flow determination 
in preparing the following analyses  we were required to estimate the future cash flows of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these items are generally reported at their maturity date  subject to assumptions regarding prepayment rates  non maturity deposit decay rates  and the call of certain of our investment securities and borrowed funds 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on the simulation model 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rate  assumed calls of securities and borrowed funds  and deposit decay rates will approximate actual future cash flows 
increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets  as fewer borrowers refinance their loans  and reduce the anticipated calls of our investment securities 
at the same time  deposit decay rates and calls of our borrowed funds may tend to increase 
if these trends occur  we could experience larger negative percent changes in our model results in the varying rate shock scenarios 
the information presented in the following tables is based on the following assumptions we assumed an annual prepayment rate for fixed rate first mortgage loans of of the fhlmc fixed rate index of moderately seasoned loans and an annual prepayment rate for variable rate first mortgage loans of of the fhlmc five year balloon index of new loans  we assumed an annual prepayment rate for our mortgage backed securities using the prepayment rate associated with the security type  page 
table of contents for savings accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one year to two years  in two years to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  for our high value checking product  which is included in interest bearing transaction accounts  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three to five years  and in more than five years  for other interest bearing transaction accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  for money market accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  and callable investment securities and borrowed funds are shown at the earlier of their probable call date or maturity date given the rate of the instrument in relation to the current market rate environment and the call option frequency  the model assumed calls of investment securities of billion and calls of borrowed funds of million over the next year in the current zero basis point change scenario 
simulation model 
we use a simulation model as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio 
this model reports net interest income and the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into the same type of product  with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits  or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds 
we have not reported the minus basis point interest rate shock scenarios in either of our simulation model analyses  as we believe  given the current interest rate environment and historical interest rate levels  the resulting information would not be meaningful 
as a primary means of managing interest rate risk  we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period 
this model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period  but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income 
the following table reports the changes to our net interest income over various interest rate change scenarios 
our internal policy sets a maximum change of given a positive or negative basis point interest rate shock 
change in percent change in interest rates net interest income basis points page 
table of contents the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would expect to experience an decrease in net interest income as compared to an decrease at december  the negative change to net interest income in the positive rate change scenarios was primarily due to the anticipated calls of borrowed funds and the increased expense of our short term time deposits in the increasing interest rate environment scenario 
the preceding table also indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would expect to experience a decrease in net interest income as compared to a decrease at december  the slight negative change to net interest income in the minus basis point rate change scenario reflects the low current market interest rate environment 
we also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the present value of equity in the different rate environments 
the present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment no rate shock of  a minimum present value ratio of in the plus basis point interest rate shock scenario and a minimum present value ratio of in the minus basis point scenario 
present value of equity as percent of present value of assets change in present basis point interest rates value ratio change basis points in the basis point increase scenario  the present value ratio was at december  as compared to at december  the change in the present value ratio was negative basis points at december  as compared to a negative basis points at december  the decrease in the present value ratio  year over year  partially reflects the decrease in our equity to asset ratio to from over the same time periods 
the decrease in the sensitivity reflects the lower current market interest rate environment resulting in less anticipated calls of our borrowed funds

table of contents in the basis point decrease scenario  the present value ratio was at december  as compared to at december  the change in the present value ratio was negative basis points at december  as compared to a negative basis points at december  the decrease in the present value ratio  year over year  reflects the decrease in our equity to asset ratio over the same time periods 
the slight decrease in the sensitivity in the minus basis point rate change scenario reflects the low current market interest rate environment 
the methods we used in simulation modeling are inherently imprecise 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve  regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity 
gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
the following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except for prepayment activity and non maturity deposit decay rates  we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
for purposes of this table  assumptions used in decay rates and prepayment activity are similar to those used in the preparation of our simulation model 
callable investment securities and borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call date  for those that are callable within one year  or at their contractual maturity date 
we reported billion of investment securities and million of borrowings at their anticipated call date 
we have excluded non accrual mortgage loans of million and non accrual other loans of  from the table

the methods used in the gap table are also inherently imprecise 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase
