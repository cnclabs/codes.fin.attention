item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  both contained herein 
international operations we operate in over countries around the world and our corporate headquarters is in houston  texas 
we have significant manufacturing operations in various countries  including  but not limited to  the united states texas  oklahoma and louisiana  the united kingdom scotland and northern ireland  germany celle  and south america venezuela and argentina 
as of december   we had approximately  employees of which approximately work outside the united states 
the business operations of our divisions are organized around four primary geographic regions north america  latin america  middle east and asia pacific  and europe  africa  russia and the caspian 
each region has a council comprised of regional vice presidents from each division as well as representatives from various functions such as human resources  legal including compliance  marketing  finance and treasury  and health  safety and environmental 
the regional vice presidents report directly to each division president 
through this structure  we have placed our management closer to the customer  facilitating stronger customer relationships and allowing us to react more quickly to local market conditions and needs 
our operations are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in multiple countries with various laws and differing political environments 
these risks include the risks identified in item a 
risk factors 
although it is impossible to predict the likelihood of such occurrences or their effect on us  we routinely evaluate these risks and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks where possible 
however  there can be no assurance that an occurrence of any one or more of these events would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents further information is contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development  patents we are engaged in research and development activities directed primarily toward the improvement of existing products and services  the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs and the development of new products  processes and services 
for information regarding the amounts of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended december   see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein 
we have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection both inside and outside the united states for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance 
we believe our patents and trademarks to be adequate for the conduct of our business  and aggressively pursue protection of our patents against patent infringement worldwide 
although patent and trademark protection is important to our business and future prospects  we consider the reliability and quality of our products and the technical skills of our personnel to be more important 
no single patent or trademark is considered to be critical to our business 
seasonality our operations can be affected by seasonal weather patterns and natural phenomena  which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services  as well as customer s budgetary cycles for capital expenditures 
the widespread geographic locations of our operations and the timing of seasonal events serve to reduce the impact of individual events 
examples of seasonal events which can impact our business include the severity and duration of the winter in north america can have a significant impact on gas storage levels and drilling activity for natural gas  the timing and duration of the spring thaw in canada directly affects activity levels due to road restrictions  hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore operations  severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the north sea and russia  and large export orders which tend to be sold in the second half of a calendar year 
raw materials we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products 
the principal materials we purchase are steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  lead  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
these materials are generally available from multiple sources and could be subject to rising costs 
we have not experienced significant shortages of these materials and normally do not carry inventories of such materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production schedules 
we do not expect significant interruptions in supply  but there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long term 
employees on december   we had approximately  employees  as compared with approximately  employees on december  approximately  of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar type labor arrangements  of which the majority are outside the us based upon the geographic diversification of these employees  we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good

environmental matters we are committed to the health and safety of people  protection of the environment and compliance with laws  regulations and our policies 
our past and present operations include activities that are subject to domestic including us federal  state and local and international regulations with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
regulation in this area continues to evolve  and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations  as well as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation  may require us and our customers to modify  supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation 
we are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former manufacturing locations or other facilities  the majority of which relate to properties obtained in acquisitions or to sites no longer actively used in operations 
on rare occasions  remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency issued consent decree or agreed order 
estimated 
table of contents remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts  existing environmental permits  technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation  our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted 
such accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation  remediation or related activities  and such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
if the obligation can only be estimated within a range  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
such accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation 
ongoing environmental compliance costs  such as obtaining environmental permits  installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal  are expensed as incurred 
during the year ended december   we spent million to comply with domestic and international standards regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment collectively  environmental regulations 
this cost includes the total spent on remediation projects at current or former sites  superfund projects and environmental compliance activities  exclusive of capital expenditures 
in  we expect to spend approximately million to comply with environmental regulations 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  and we estimate we will incur approximately million during in addition  we estimate we will incur approximately million in capital expenditures for the relocation of an existing plant in the uk to comply with local environmental regulations 
depending on the resolution of environmental permitting  up to million may be spent in and the remainder in based upon current information  we believe that our compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our cost for that compliance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act known as superfund or cercla imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault  even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp in remedial activities related to various superfund sites  and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site 
with the joint and several liability imposed under superfund  a prp may be required to pay more than its proportional share of such costs 
we have been identified as a prp at various superfund sites discussed below 
the united states environmental protection agency the epa and appropriate state agencies supervise investigative and cleanup activities at these sites 
for the year ended december   we paid million in superfund costs and have accrued an additional million related to these sites 
payments made in are in addition to amounts previously paid in settlements  cash calls or other superfund costs  and these ongoing contributions reduce our financial liability for the total site cleanup costs shown below 
when used in the descriptions of the sites that follow  the word de minimis refers to the smallest prps  whose contribution rate is usually less than 
a in  baker oil tools  baker petrolite and predecessor entities of baker petrolite were named as prps by the state of california s department of toxic substances control for the gibson site in bakersfield  california 
remediation consisting of extensive soil excavation and removal is now complete at a cost of approximately million  with remaining costs estimated at less than million 
our combined volume allocation is for liquids and for solids 
b in  a hughes christensen predecessor  baker oil tools  inteq and one of our former subsidiaries were named as prps in the force road state superfund site located in brazoria county  texas 
the texas commission on environmental quality tceq is overseeing the investigation and remediation at the force road site 
we participate as a member of the steering and technical committees to effectively manage the project because our volumetric contribution is currently estimated at approximately 
the investigation phase of the project is essentially complete and the results indicate that the extent of the groundwater contamination is less than originally estimated 
these results along with new surveys indicate little to no offsite impact 
we believe that after the most effective remedial alternatives are identified  the remedial costs could be less than million 
an accurate calculation of site remediation costs will be available once the remedial action plan is developed  which will occur during early million was raised from the de minimis settlement process  which is now complete 
c in  baker petrolite predecessors  hughes christensen predecessors and several of our former subsidiaries were identified as prps for the malone site located on campbell bayou road in texas city  texas 
the epa oversees the investigation and remediation of the malone site and has engaged in emergency removal actions 
the investigation is complete and remedial alternatives have been developed and submitted to the epa for evaluation 
the epa has concluded that the remaining costs for the remedial action are million 
along with the epa oversight costs  project management fees and other expenses  the total outstanding project costs are not expected to exceed million 
our contribution was recently adjusted downward and is now 
a lawsuit filed by the current owners of the site and a related entity against the prp group malone cooperating parties seeking recovery of certain alleged damages was settled at a cost of million  and included arrangements for the eventual transfer of the property to a conservation organization or other non profit entity 

table of contents d in  we were identified as a de minimis prp by the epa for the operating industries  inc superfund site in monterrey park  california 
a settlement offer to all remaining de minimis parties has been repeatedly delayed 
the epa and steering committee have incurred approximately million and expect an additional million in cleanup costs 
information provided by the epa in indicates that our contribution is  although our ultimate liability has yet to be negotiated and may include a premium for early settlement 
e in  baker petrolite was notified by the epa of their potential involvement at the cooper drum superfund site located in south gate  california 
we responded to an additional inquiry from the epa in at this time  the estimate for comprehensive cleanup costs is approximately million but the extent of our responsibility for these costs is not yet known 
f in  we were one of five prps to receive an information request from the epa regarding the washington county lead district superfund site  a federal superfund located in washington county  missouri 
we have responded to the epa regarding our involvement with two of the six mines listed in the information request 
a preliminary screening and removal action has been completed by the epa to evaluate the impacts of lead and other heavy metals on the soil and groundwater in the area 
in late  the site was proposed for inclusion on the national priorities list 
there has been no formal assignment of responsibility and an estimate of potential cleanup costs has not been developed  therefore  we are unable to estimate the potential cost to the company 
g in  baker petrolite received a general notice of potential liability letter from the epa concerning the rrg clayton chemical superfund site in sauget  illinois and its impact on the adjacent sauget area groundwater superfund site 
we have participated in cleanup activities at the clayton site as a small party with an allocation just over the de minimis level 
our known costs are approximately of the estimated remedy cost of million 
however  our ultimate liability may now include some responsibility for the downgradient groundwater cleanup at the sauget area groundwater superfund site  however  sufficient information is not available to estimate the additional potential cost to the company 
h in  a settlement demand was received from the prp group for the pulvair superfund site located in millington  tennessee for waste sent to the site by milchem  a predecessor to baker hughes drilling fluids 
the matter has not yet been resolved  however  it is expected to be settled at a cost of less than million 
in addition to the sites mentioned above  there are six superfund sites where we have ongoing obligations 
the emergency removal actions and subsequent remedial work at most of these sites has been completed and remaining operations are limited to groundwater recovery and or monitoring 
the monitoring phase can continue for up to years 
our aggregate cost for these sites is estimated to be million over this period of time 
while prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability for all costs of remediation  it is not possible at this time to quantify our ultimate exposure because some of the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage  or allocation information is not yet available 
however  based upon current information  we do not believe that probable or reasonably possible expenditures in connection with the sites described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements because we have recorded adequate reserves to cover the estimate we presently believe will be our ultimate liability in the matter 
further  other prps involved in the sites have substantial assets and may reasonably be expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation  and  in some circumstances  we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover a portion of or the ultimate liability 
we are subject to various other governmental proceedings and regulations  including foreign regulations  relating to environmental matters  but we do not believe that any of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and improving our assurance programs

our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental regulations  including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  are only our forecasts regarding these matters 
these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which may be affected by the following factors changes in environmental regulations  a material change in our allocation or other unexpected  adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a prp  including without limitation the superfund sites described above  the discovery of new sites of which we are not aware and where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental regulations  an unexpected

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves various risks 
when considering an investment in our company  one should consider carefully all of the risk factors described below  as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this report 
there may be additional risks  uncertainties and matters not listed below  that we are unaware of  or that we currently consider immaterial 
any of these could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and  thus  the value of an investment in our company 
risk factors related to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry our business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry  therefore  our risk factors include those factors that impact  either positively or negatively  the markets for oil and natural gas 
expenditures by our customers for exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas are based on their expectations of future hydrocarbon demand  the risks associated with developing the reserves and the future value of the hydrocarbon reserves 
their evaluation of the future value is based  in part  on their expectations for global demand  global supply and other factors that influence oil and natural gas prices 
the key risk factors currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below 
demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
growth in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  as well as the demand for our services  is highly correlated with global economic growth  and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the us and china  who are significant users of oil and natural gas 
increases in global economic activity  particularly in china and developing asia  create more demand for oil and natural gas and higher oil and natural gas prices 
a slowing of global economic growth  and in particular in the us or china  will likely reduce demand for oil and natural gas  increase spare productive capacity and result in lower prices and adversely impact the demand for our services 
in addition  demand for hydrocarbons could be impacted by environmental regulation targeting reduction of greenhouse gas emissions including the cost for carbon capture and sequestration 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services 
while current energy prices are important contributors to positive cash flow for our customers  expectations about future prices and price volatility are generally more important for determining future spending levels 
while higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers  sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth  and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers 
our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk 
any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed  as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 
advanced technologies  such as horizontal drilling  improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline 
access to prospects and capital are also important to our customers 
access to prospects may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect 
access to capital is dependent on our customers ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based on their expectations of future energy prices  required investments and resulting returns 
government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations  may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 
supply can be interrupted by a number of factors including political instability  civil unrest  labor issues  terrorist attacks  war or military activity 
key oil producing countries which could be subject to supply interruptions include  but are not limited to  saudi arabia  iraq and other middle eastern countries  nigeria  norway  russia and venezuela 
the impact of supply disruptions on oil and 
table of contents natural gas prices and oil and natural gas price volatility is tempered by the size and expected duration of the disruption relative to the spare productive capacity at the time of the disruption 
supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual organization of petroleum exporting countries opec nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries  including  but not limited to  norway and russia  are willing and able to control production and exports of oil  to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives 
any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the worldwide oil and natural gas industry is subject to geopolitical and terrorism risks 
geopolitical risks and terrorist activity continue to grow in several key countries where the company does business 
these risks could lead to a loss of investment in the country as well as a disruption in business activities 
spare productive capacity and future demand impact our operations 
oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand 
high or increasing storage or inventories generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften 
low or decreasing storage or inventories are an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise 
measures of maximum productive capacity compared to demand spare productive capacity are also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies 
when spare productive capacity is low compared to demand  energy prices tend to be higher and more volatile reflecting the increased vulnerability of the entire system to disruption 
seasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for our services and operations 
weather can also have a significant impact on demand as consumption of energy is seasonal and any variation from normal weather patterns  cooler or warmer summers and winters  can have a significant impact on demand 
adverse weather conditions  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  may interrupt or curtail our operations  or our customers operations  cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities  which may or may not be insured 
risk factors related to our business our expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors we operate in a highly competitive environment  which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield services and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to maintain or increase prices for our products and services  maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers 
in order to be competitive  we must provide new technologies  and reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers 
our ability to maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry s capacity relative to customer demand  and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitor s products and services 
in addition  our ability to negotiate acceptable contract terms and conditions with our customers  especially state owned national oil companies  our ability to manage warranty claims and our ability to effectively manage our commercial agents can also impact our results of operations 
managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results 
development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results and can result in the potential impairment of long lived assets 
we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active 

table of contents the high cost or unavailability of infrastructure  materials  equipment  supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 
our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials  component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories 
our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business  including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals  control costs and avoid shortages of raw materials and component parts 
raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  lead  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers 
a lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog  which may limit our ability to respond to short lead time orders 
people are a key resource to developing  manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world 
our ability to manage the recruiting  training and retention of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business 
a well trained  motivated work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
rapid growth presents a challenge to us and our industry to recruit  train and retain our employees while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 
labor related actions  including strikes  slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business 
the terms and the impact of the settlement with the department of justice doj and sec may negatively impact our ongoing operations 
under the settlements in connection with the previously disclosed compliance investigations by the doj and sec  we are subject to ongoing review and regulation of our business operations  including the review of our operations and compliance program by an independent monitor appointed to assess our foreign corrupt practices act fcpa policies and procedures 
the activities of the independent monitor will have a cost to us and may cause a change in our processes and operations  the outcome of which we are unable to predict 
in addition  the settlements may impact our operations or result in legal actions against us in the countries that are the subject of the settlements 
also  the collateral impact of settlement in the united states and other countries outside the united states where we do business that may claim jurisdiction over any of the matters related to the doj and sec settlements could be material 
these settlements could also result in third party claims against us  which may include claims for special  indirect  derivative or consequential damages 
in addition  we could incur additional taxes as a result of our resolution with the doj and sec 
our failure to comply with the terms of our agreements with the doj and sec would have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 
under the settlements with the doj and sec  we are subject to a two year deferred prosecution agreement and enjoined by the federal district court against any further violations of the fcpa 
accordingly  the settlements reached with the doj and sec could be substantially nullified and we could be subject to severe sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a subsequent violation by us or any of our employees or our failure to meet all of the conditions contained in the settlements 
the impact of the settlements on our ongoing operations could include limits on revenue growth and increases in operating costs 
our ability to comply with the terms of the settlements is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program  including our ability to continue to manage our agents and business partners and supervise  train and retain competent employees and the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and the baker hughes business code of conduct 
compliance with and changes in laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect operating results 
our operations in the us and over countries can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate 
our ability to manage our compliance costs will impact our ability to meet our earnings goals 
compliance related issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries 
changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation  new regulation  new policies  investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of the existing legal rules and regulations  in particular  changes in export control laws or exchange control laws  additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions  and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate 
changes that impact the business environment include changes in accounting standards  changes in environmental laws  changes in tax laws or tax rates  the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities  and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits 
in addition  we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 
if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings  our effective tax rate could be materially impacted 

table of contents these changes could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct  or if we conduct  business in the affected countries 
uninsured claims and litigation could adversely impact our operating results 
we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings 
we have insurance coverage against operating hazards  including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products  to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available  however  no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation 
this insurance has deductibles or self insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions 
the insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices 
whenever possible  we obtain agreements from customers that limit our liability 
insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks  and our results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance 
compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our business is impacted by unexpected outcomes or material changes in environmental liability 
changes in our environmental liability could originate with the discovery of new environmental remediation sites  changes in environmental regulations  or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment 
control of oil and gas reserves by state owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and create additional risks in our operations 
much of the world s oil and gas reserves are controlled by state owned oil companies 
state owned oil companies may require its contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards that could be difficult for the company to meet 
the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact the company s operations in those countries 
in addition  many state owned oil companies may require integrated contracts or turn key contracts that could require the company to provide services outside its core business 
providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis generally require the company to assume additional risks 
changes in economic conditions and currency fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results 
fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our costs of doing business 
most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in us dollars or local currency indexed to us dollars 
local expenses and some of our manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone  venezuelan bolivar  australian dollar and brazilian real  can increase or decrease our expenses reported in us dollars and may adversely impact our results of operations 
the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing  if necessary
