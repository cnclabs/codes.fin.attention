table of contents but are not limited to  those described above under item a  risk factors 
we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements contained in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
overview we own and operate dental laboratories located in states and one canadian province  serving an active customer base of over  dentists 
our business consists of the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for dentists located primarily in the domestic marketplace 
our products are grouped into the following three main categories restorative products 
restorative products that our dental laboratories sell consist primarily of crowns and bridges 
a crown replaces the part of a tooth that is visible  and is usually made of gold  porcelain or zirconia 
a bridge is a restoration of one or more missing teeth that is permanently attached to the natural teeth or roots 
in addition to the traditional crown  we also make porcelain jackets  which are crowns constructed entirely of porcelain  onlays  which are partial crowns which do not cover all of the visible tooth  and precision crowns  which are restorations designed to receive and connect a removable partial denture 
we also make inlays  which are restorations made to fit a prepared tooth cavity and then cemented into place 
reconstructive products 
reconstructive products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of partial dentures and full dentures 
partial dentures are removable dental prostheses that replace missing teeth and associated structures 
full dentures are dental prostheses that substitute for the total loss of teeth and associated structures 
we also sell precision attachments  which connect a crown and an artificial prosthesis  and implants  which are fixtures anchored securely in the bone of the mouth to which a crown  partial or full denture is secured by means of screws or clips 
cosmetic products 
cosmetic products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of porcelain veneers and ceramic crowns 
porcelain veneers are thin coverings of porcelain cemented to the front of a tooth to enhance personal appearance 
ceramic crowns are crowns made from ceramic materials that most closely replicate natural teeth 
we also sell composite inlays and onlays  which replace silver fillings for a more natural appearance  and orthodontic appliances  which are products fabricated to move existing teeth to enhance function and appearance 
recent trends during fiscal  internal sales growth  meaning growth at laboratories held for longer than one year  was  including the effect of increased prices due to underlying increases in the prices of precious metals 
during fiscal  internal sales growth was essentially flat with a sales decline of  we believe that the low cost segment for united states based dental laboratories has begun to decline as competition from offshore laboratories  primarily those located in china  makes inroads into the domestic marketplace 
while our business has not focused on this low cost segment of the market  we have experienced price pressures from other laboratories in our marketplaces that have restrained our ability to increase prices 
during  these increasing competitive pressures in the form of low price competition were partially responsible for declines in revenues or revenue growth in several marketplaces 
in addition  we face growing competition from technology based solutions that allow dentists to fabricate their own restorations without the use of a dental laboratory 
both of these trends appear to be impacting industry growth  and have been inhibiting our results of operations 
technology based dental laboratory cad cam manufacturing solutions have required us to make additional investments in capital equipment 
we believe that these investments are critical to our business strategies 
the main components of our costs are labor and related employee benefits as well as raw materials  including precious metals 
over the past several years  competition for labor resources and increases in medical insurance premiums as well as volatility in the prices of many precious metals that we use  such as gold and palladium  have driven these costs higher 
in we evaluated and adjusted staffing levels as appropriate at each of our locations  while continuing to recognize the need to maintain an available and properly trained workforce 
since we have experienced cost pressures resulting from the implementation expenditures necessary to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the impact of these various section implementation costs 
table of contents on earnings for fiscal was approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes 
for fiscal  these costs were approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes  while in  these costs were approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes 
in  these costs further decreased to  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes  with the reduction primarily resulting from revisions to the standards governing the audit of internal control over financial reporting 
significant ongoing expenditures will continue to be required to maintain our compliance with the internal controls framework required by the sarbanes oxley act 
acquisitions we have also continued to pursue our acquisition strategy  which has played an important role in helping us increase sales from  in to  in we recognize acquired customer relationships and trade names as intangible assets which require the recognition of amortization expense for the customer relationships and impairment testing for the customer relationships  trade names and goodwill 
in march  we completed what was then our largest acquisition to date  green dental laboratories  inc green 
green is treated as a separate reportable segment for financial reporting purposes and retains a separate company identity as a wholly owned subsidiary 
in october  we completed our largest acquisition to date  that of keller group  incorporated keller of st 
louis  missouri 
keller is also a wholly owned subsidiary and is treated as a separate reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
keller differs from national dentex in its approach to marketing and to the marketplace 
in recent years keller has broadened its focus from local markets in the midwest to the national marketplace 
in order to sustain this strategy  keller invests significantly in product advertising  primarily in dental print publications  and in direct mail 
as a result  keller has returned lower net margins than our other operating segments 
however  it has obtained stronger sales growth and operating margins have improved 
in january  we announced a realignment of our corporate organization that reflects our recent acquisitions and is designed to help us better execute our operational strategy 
in order to finance the purchase of green and keller  we borrowed approximately  in long term debt 
future acquisitions may also be financed using available debt financing 
as a result of our acquisitions of green and keller  we are more highly leveraged than we were previously 
our interest expense has therefore become a more significant component of our pre tax earnings 
interest expense in was  compared to  in   in and  in overview of results of operations for the year ended december   sales increased  to  and net income increased  the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of  keller and impact  were primarily responsible for this sales growth 
in the ndx laboratories operating segment  consisting of our laboratories other than keller and green  the consolidation of certain laboratories and departments  with the goal of improving segment profitability  led to the loss of certain customers and contributed to the decline in same laboratory sales 
same laboratory sales  measured by business at dental laboratories owned more than one year  declined  in the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
for the year ended december   gross profit increased by  within the ndx laboratories operating segment  green s gross profit increased by  over the prior year and keller contributed  of acquired gross profit and fourth quarter sales growth of 
keller s results for included only fourth quarter sales 
overall results benefited from staffing adjustments which lowered labor costs and related health insurance expense  as well as from increasing returns in laboratory technology investments 
same laboratory labor and benefits expenses declined  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources on august  we entered into an amended and restated financing agreement the amended agreement with bank of america  na the bank 
the amended agreement included a revolving line of credit of  a revolving acquisition line of credit of  and a term loan facility of  the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit and the term loan was the prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of

the amended agreement required monthly payments of principal on the term loan  based on a seven year amortization schedule  with a final payment due on the fifth anniversary of the amended agreement 
the amended agreement required compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth  income and other financial ratios 
in october we borrowed against our acquisition line of credit to finance our acquisition of keller 
in order to refinance the borrowings incurred for the keller acquisition  we and the bank executed a second amended and restated loan agreement as of november  the second agreement comprising uncollateralized senior credit facilities totaling  the second agreement amended and restated the amended agreement a to increase the term loan facility to an aggregate principal amount of  and used the proceeds of the increase in the term loan to repay the portion of the outstanding principal balance under the acquisition line of credit and b to adjust the allocation of availability under the lines of credit by increasing the revolving line of credit to   of which may be used for future acquisitions and decreasing the acquisition line of credit from  to  the interest rate on both lines of credit and the term loan is now the prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of funds rate or the bank s fixed rate  plus  in each case  a range of to  depending on the ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as each is defined in the second agreement 
the term loan facility portion of the second agreement requires monthly interest payments and monthly payments of principal  based on a seven year amortization schedule  with a final payment due on the fifth anniversary of the second agreement 
the acquisition line of credit and the first line of credit mature on the third anniversary of the second agreement 
the second agreement requires compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth  income and other financial ratios 
the second agreement was amended effective june  to revise certain financial targets within these covenants

table of contents payments for acquisitions  including deferred purchase price payments associated with prior period dental laboratory acquisitions  totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   which resulted primarily from the acquisition of keller 
capital expenditures increased from  at december  to  at december  primarily due to leasehold improvements for new facilities 
in financing activities  current liabilities attributed to bank debt increased  during fiscal amounts borrowed on our revolving line of credit increased by  primarily due to new facility expenditures while the current portion of long term debt declined  as a result of the payment of acquired bank debt related to the acquisition of keller 
long term bank debt  less the current portion  declined  to  at december  from  at december  as a result of scheduled term loan repayments 
we believe that cash flow from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet contemplated operating and capital requirements such as those discussed below  for the foreseeable future

interest expense payments  included in the above table  related to the term loan facility have been projected using the interest rate associated with current borrowings 
we are committed under various non cancelable operating lease agreements covering office space and dental laboratory facilities  vehicles and certain equipment 
certain of these leases also require us to pay maintenance  repairs  insurance and related taxes 
laboratory purchase obligations totaling  classified as deferred acquisition costs  are presented in the liability section of the balance sheet 
these obligations  including deferred obligations associated with non competition agreements  represent purchase price commitments arising from dental laboratory acquisitions  irrespective of the acquired laboratory s earnings performance 
contingent laboratory purchase price includes amounts subject to acquisition agreements that are tied to laboratory earnings performance  as defined within the acquisition agreements  generally over a three year period 
as payments become determinable  they are recorded in our purchase price allocation 
the amount included in the table represents the maximum contractual amount that could be paid under the agreements 

table of contents results of operations our results are reported within three operating segments  ndx laboratories  green dental and keller 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated financial statements years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other expense interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   net sales increased  or over the prior year 
net sales increased by approximately  primarily as a result of acquisitions measured by business at dental laboratories owned less than one year 
net sales decreased approximately  at dental laboratories owned for both the year ended december  and the year ended december   primarily as a result of sales declines in the ndx laboratories operating segment 
competitive pressures from offshore laboratories that can produce crowns at fees lower than crowns manufactured in the united states continue to limit our ability to raise our prices during a time when we have experienced relatively higher costs for precious metals used in manufacturing 
in addition  these competitive pressures are partially responsible for declines in revenues or revenue growth in several marketplaces 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased by  or in the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from to  primarily resulting from decreases in labor and related benefits  partially offset by increases in materials expense and laboratory overhead 
excluding acquisitions  production labor and related benefits decreased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to reductions in our staffing levels at certain laboratories 
the cost of raw materials as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in the average cost of precious metals used as components of many dental alloys  including gold and palladium  increased by approximately for gold and for palladium over average costs in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  the average cost of gold increased by over the average cost in the fourth quarter of although we are able to pass a portion of precious metal cost increases on to our customers  prolonged higher metal costs have had and likely will continue to have a negative impact on gross profit percentages

in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis  based on a two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
we view the individual laboratories as reporting units 
we determine fair value using factors based on revenue and operating margins 
in the second quarter of  and we completed the annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment existed 
additionally  we also recognize the existence of value in trade names acquired in business combinations and believe the useful life of this intangible to be indefinite 
accordingly  trade names are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis using a single step method in accordance with sfas no 
impairment charges related to trade names are recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset 
impairment charges of   and  were recorded in the year ended december   and  respectively
