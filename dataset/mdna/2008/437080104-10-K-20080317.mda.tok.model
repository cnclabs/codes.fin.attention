item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the years described 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements and risk factors 
the operating results for the years presented were not significantly affected by inflation 
company overview we are a developer  manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced blood glucose monitoring systems and disposable supplies for diabetics worldwide 
we market our blood glucose monitoring systems both under our own hdi brands and through a unique co branding strategy in partnership with the leading food and drug retailers  mass merchandisers  distributors  mail service providers and third party payors in the united states and internationally 
our co branding distribution strategy allows our customers to leverage their brand strategy with ours and to deliver high quality  low cost blood glucose monitoring systems to their diabetic customers at attractive price points for the consumer and increased profit margins for the retailer or distributor 
our company was founded in and has focused exclusively on the diabetes market since inception 
we have two manufacturing facilities  one located in fort lauderdale  florida  and the other in hsinchu city  taiwan 
we manufacture  test and package our blood glucose test strips at our facility in fort lauderdale 
our blood glucose monitors are assembled in our taiwan facility 
labeling  final assembly  quality control testing and shipment of our blood glucose monitoring systems are conducted in our fort lauderdale facility 
we have a highly automated manufacturing process with sufficient capacity to continue to grow our business without significant incremental capital investments  other than for new product development 
we sell our products in the following distribution channels retail the retail channel generates the majority of sales of blood glucose monitoring products in the united states and includes chain drug stores  food stores and mass merchandisers 
we sell our products into the retail channel on a direct basis or through domestic distributors 
our retail net sales include products we sell directly into the retail channel for the larger food and drug retailers 
domestic distribution the domestic distribution channel includes sales to domestic wholesalers  including amerisourcebergen  cardinal health  mckesson  and invacare  who sell products to independent and chain food and drug retailers  primary and long term care providers  durable medical equipment suppliers and mail service providers 
mail service the mail service channel includes sales to leading mail service providers  who market their products primarily to the medicare population 
international the international channel consists of sales on a direct basis in the united kingdom and canada and through distributors primarily in latin america  germany  australia  and china 

table of contents our net sales by channel were as follows for the years indicated years ended december  in thousands retail domestic distribution mail service international we enter into agreements with certain of our customers from time to time addressing terms of sale  volume discounts  minimum requirements for maintaining exclusivity and the like 
however  we do not rely on written agreements to any significant extent  but rather on our relationships with our customers 
most of our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders  and we do not have any agreements that require customers to purchase any minimum amount of our products except with certain international distribution agreements 
we have an agreement with one of our largest customers  mckesson  that provides for its medical surgical division to be the exclusive private label or co brand distributor of our truetrack system for the long term care market  so long as certain minimum purchase thresholds were met 
although the agreement does not require mckesson to purchase any minimum amount of our products  other than to maintain exclusivity  over one half of our sales to mckesson in were pursuant to the agreement 
our gross margins have generally been in the range of to 
we strive to maximize our installed base of monitors to drive future sales of our test strips 
monitors  which are sold individually or in a starter kit with a sample of test strips and other supplies  are typically sold at or below cost 
it is also common for us to provide monitors free of charge in support of managed care initiatives and other market opportunities 
test strip sales are a significant driver of our overall gross margins 
we measure our operating performance in many ways  including the ratio of test strips to monitors sold in a given period 
our gross margins are affected by several factors  including manufacturing cost reductions  the ratio of test strips to monitors  free monitor distributions and product pricing 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing expenses  legal and regulatory costs  customer and technical service  finance and administrative expenses and stock based compensation expenses 
we have been involved in patent related litigation concerning certain of our products 
our legal costs excluding litigation settlements  which were  and of net sales in  and  respectively  can be significant  and the timing difficult to predict 
our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased for costs associated with being a publicly traded company  including accounting and auditing  legal  insurance  director compensation  sarbanes oxley compliance and other costs 
we have made significant investments in our research and development initiatives 
our research and development costs have generally been in the range of to of our net sales and include salaries and related costs for our scientists and staff as well as costs for clinical studies  materials  consulting and other third party services 
our research and development team is working to develop new technologies that we believe will broaden our product portfolio and enhance our current products

the million average selling price increase was primarily driven by a greater mix of higher priced biosensor system test strip sales 
the million reduction in our provision for sales returns resulted primarily from favorable return rates for our biosensor systems which have stabilized since launching in the increase in managed care rebates was due primarily to increased awareness and acceptance within the third party payor environment of our products

interest income was earned on the net proceeds from the ipo 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to the decrease in the change in fair value of the warrant put option  which is not taxable and the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately million related to the recognition of previously unclaimed research and development r d tax credits associated with tax years through we elected to pursue the tax credits in due to changes in economic circumstances including increased r d spending to develop new products and to reduce our cash income tax payments 
our cash taxes have gradually increased since when we became a cash tax payer following the complete utilization of our net operating losses 
we completed our r d tax study during the year ended december  r d tax credits covering the years through are presently under audit by the internal revenue service in connection with the audit of our and federal tax return 
the effective tax rate for year ended december  exceeded the statutory federal rate  primarily as a result of the increase in the fair value of the warrant put option and stock based compensation expense for incentive stock options  both of which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
net income increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the increase in net income for the year ended december  was due primarily to reduced expense related to the change in fair value of the warrant put option and the lower provision for income taxes due to the r d tax credit 
the litigation settlement in reduced net income by million 
diluted net income per common share was on weighted average shares of million for the year ended december   as compared to on weighted average shares of million in liquidity and capital resources on december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million of capacity under our unsecured revolving line of credit 
our primary capital requirements are to fund capital expenditures and fund common stock repurchases under our board approved common stock repurchase program  as described below 
significant sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flows from operating activities  working capital and borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
under our fourth amended and restated revolving credit agreement the credit facility  we have a million unsecured revolving line of credit the revolver which matures on november  at december   there was no outstanding balance under the revolver 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the libor plus 
our credit facility contains a financial covenant and other covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  incur liens  repurchase shares and participate in a change in control 
our financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net 
table of contents worth of not more than to failure to comply with this covenant and other restrictions would constitute an event of default under our credit facility 
we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenant and other restrictions applicable to us under the credit facility at december  in august  the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock the common stock repurchase program 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million 
all purchases under the common stock repurchase program were made in the open market  subject to market conditions and trading restrictions 
in march  the company s board of director s authorized the repurchase of an additional million of its common stock 
in conjunction with the authorization of the additional million  our lender under the credit facility waived the covenant which had restricted us from retiring or repurchasing shares of our common stock 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was due to improved working capital and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes of approximately million  partially offset by the funding of the million roche patent litigation settlement 
see note 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts consist primarily of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in  and include expenditures for manufacturing equipment for a new blood glucose monitoring system under development 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately to million including the remaining costs for a new blood glucose monitoring system 
in addition  in may  we acquired our distributor in the united kingdom for a purchase price of million 
cash flows used in provided by financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows used in financing activities in include million used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our million common stock repurchase program  offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under the revolver 
cash flows provided by financing activities in include ipo net proceeds of million  described below  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  offset by payments to redeem our preferred stock of million and debt repayments of million 
during the year ended december   total outstanding amounts under our million revolving credit facility ranged from zero to million  primarily reflecting borrowings to fund income tax payments and capital expenditures and repayments from cash provided by operating activities 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under the revolver 
cash flows used in financing activities in consist primarily of debt borrowings and repayments  including the repayment of million of debt assumed in an acquisition in may on september   we completed an ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share   of which were sold by us and the remainder by selling stockholders 
we received net proceeds after underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately million 
we used million of the net proceeds of the offering to redeem all the series f preferred stock outstanding and million to repay outstanding indebtedness 
the redemption of the preferred stock resulted in a dividend charge to stockholders equity of million 
in addition  the holder of a warrant to purchase our common stock exercised its registration rights and exchanged the warrant for  shares of common stock 
these shares were sold at per share in connection with the ipo for a total of million which is reflected in stockholders equity at december  on october   the underwriters on our ipo  exercised their over allotment option to purchase  additional shares of common stock from certain selling stockholders at the public offering price of per share 
we did not issue any new shares of common stock or receive any proceeds from the sale of the over allotment shares 

table of contents we expect that funds generated from operations  our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations and commitments payments due less than obligation total year years years operating leases purchase obligations amounts exclude certain income tax contingencies of approximately million for which the timing of payments is not determinable 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  sales or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies  which are all in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  because their application requires management to make assumptions about future results and depends to a large extent on management s judgment  because past results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
we believe that the application of the accounting policies described in the following paragraphs is highly dependent on critical estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and highly susceptible to change 
for all these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those discussed below 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we generally arrange for the shipment of customer orders and it is our general business practice to replace products that may be damaged or lost while in transit at no additional cost to the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized when goods are received by our customers 
we accept product returns primarily due to the expiration of product life 
revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
we estimate returns based on an analysis of historical sales and returns  analyzing the actual return date of the product as compared to the original date of sale of the product 
we have estimated based on historical return experience that a reserve is required for future returns covering the prior to months of sales  driven primarily by the to month expiration of our test strip products 
products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating or other matters are specifically identified and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals 

table of contents we offer volume discount incentives to certain of our customers  which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned 
we also have reimbursement agreements with certain managed care providers  medicaid programs and other third party payors that require payment of rebates for products provided to their members 
we accrue for these rebates as a reduction of revenue  at the time of sale 
the determination of the rebate allowance is based on the reimbursement agreements as well as historical payment trends to these providers 
we also offer meters  at no charge  to customers and third party payors 
the cost of these meters is recorded in cost of sales in the period the products are shipped 
we arrange with certain of our customers upfront cash payments to secure the right to distribute through those customers 
we capitalize these payments  provided the payments are supported by a time or volume based arrangement with a retailer  and amortizes the associated payment over the appropriate time or volume based term of the arrangement 
long lived and other intangible assets 
we periodically review our property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived and other intangible assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
significant assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenue and expense growth rates and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired net of liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
we periodically evaluate goodwill for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our business 
we carry out an annual impairment review of goodwill unless an event occurs which triggers the need for an earlier review 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our business is impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in determining the fair value  we utilize discounted future cash flows 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing discounted future cash flows include  but are not limited to i estimates of future revenue and expense growth  ii estimated average cost of capital  and iii the future terminal value of our reporting unit  which is based upon its ability to exist into perpetuity 
the test for goodwill impairment requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value 
our future results could be affected if our estimates of future performance and fair value change 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we completed our annual test during the quarter ended december  and no impairment charge resulted 
contingencies 
we accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the realization of the losses probable and the losses can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation claims based on currently available information to assess potential liability 
we develop our estimates of litigation costs in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
these estimates involve significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances of each case 
our future results could be affected if our estimated loss accruals  if any  are below the actual costs incurred 
any resulting loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we settled in  litigation involving alleged patent infringement and other matters 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  in the first quarter of this statement is a revision to sfas no

 statement of cash flows 
this 
table of contents statement requires us to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements with respect to these equity arrangements 
as permitted under sfas for private companies  we have been using the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments for pro forma disclosure purposes 
accordingly  we are applying the provisions of sfas no 
r prospectively solely to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled subsequent to january  under the provisions of sfas r  we have estimated the fair value of new stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
significant changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
in accordance with sfas r  we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity based awards based on grant date fair value 
pre vesting forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant are periodically revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
equity based compensation is only recognized for equity based awards expected to vest 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is recognized based upon the difference  if any  at the measurement date between the estimated fair market value of the underlying common stock and the option exercise price 
the measurement date is the date at which both the number of options and the exercise price for each option are known 
certain employee stock options are accounted for as variable stock options due to a repricing in for these options  a non cash charge representing the excess of the estimated fair market value or quoted market price of the underlying common stock at the end of each reporting period over the exercise price is recorded as stock based compensation until the options are fully exercised or forfeited 
prior to the ipo in september  determining the fair value of our common stock required making complex and subjective judgments 
in estimating fair value we considered both the value derived by using a discounted future cash flow model as well as actual trading activity in our common stock  if any 
our discounted cash flow model includes significant estimates including future earnings and discount rates 
in june  we completed a voluntary buy back of our common stock for non employee stockholders owning  shares or less at a price of per share 
approximately  shares of our common stock were purchased under the buy back  which represented over of the eligible shares 
the value of the shares repurchased in connection with this offer and the high level of participation by the population of potential sellers confirmed the reasonableness of our estimated value in april income taxes 
we recognize our provision for income taxes at the applicable us or international tax rates 
deferred income taxes are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are also established for the future tax benefits of loss and credit carryovers 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that such amounts will not be realized 
us income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since it is management s intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations for an indefinite period of time 
we account for income tax uncertainties under fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which provides guidance on the recognition  derecognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million 
it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may significantly decrease within the next twelve months resulting from the finalization of federal income tax audits for the and tax years 
the estimated range of the reasonably possible decrease is million to million 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fsp partial deferral of the effective date of statement fsp 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our future results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
will be effective for us on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our future results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf related to issue no 
 accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
eitf issue no 
permits entities to capitalize nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities are required to evaluate whether they expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf issue no 
will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
to have a material effect on our future results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas r s scope is broader than that of sfas  which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 
sfas r applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
the standard requires the fair value of the purchase price  including the issuance of equity securities  to be determined on the acquisition date 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
sfas r requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred and restructuring costs to be expensed in periods after the acquisition date
