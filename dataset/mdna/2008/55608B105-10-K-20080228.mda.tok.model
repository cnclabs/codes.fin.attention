general the company is a delaware limited liability company that was formed on april  effective january   with the approval of the irs  we elected to be treated as a corporation for us federal and state income tax purposes 

table of contents we own  operate and invest in a diversified group of infrastructure businesses that are providing basic  everyday services  such as parking  utilities and water  through long life physical assets 
these infrastructure businesses generally operate in sectors with limited competition and high barriers to entry 
as a result  they have sustainable and growing long term cash flows 
we operate and finance our businesses in a manner that maximizes these cash flows 
the company is dependent upon cash distributions from its businesses to meet its corporate overhead  to pay management fee expenses and to pay dividends 
we receive distributions through our directly owned holding company mic inc for all of our businesses based in the united states 
distributions received from our businesses and investments net of taxes  are available first to meet management fees and corporate overhead expenses  then to fund distribution payments by the company to our shareholders 
base and performance management fees payable to our manager are allocated among the company and the directly owned subsidiaries based on the company s internal allocation policy 
tax treatment of distributions through the year ended december   each holder of trust stock was required to include in us federal taxable income its allocable share of the trust s income  gain  loss deductions and other items 
the amounts shareholders include in taxable income may not have equaled the cash distributions to shareholders 
the agreement reached with the irs referred to in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k  allows the company to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes beginning january  for tax years subsequent to  shareholders will need to include in taxable income the portion of our distributions characterized as a dividend 
the company has determined that all of our distributions made in will be characterized as return of capital for tax purposes and will result in an adjustment to the shareholder s basis rather than taxable income 
the portion of our future distributions that will be treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes is subject to a number of uncertainties 
we currently anticipate that all of our regular distributions that are treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes will be eligible for treatment as qualified dividend income  subject to the shareholder having met the holding period requirements as defined by the irs 
acquisitions and dispositions on december   we completed our ipo and concurrent private placement  issuing a total of  shares of trust stock at a price of per share 
total gross proceeds were million before offering costs and underwriting fees of million 
the majority of the proceeds were used to acquire our airports services business  district energy business  airport parking business  share in a toll road business and investments in mcg and sew in december since our ipo  we have completed two additional equity raisings and have used these proceeds to partially finance additional acquisitions in our existing business segments and in new segments including the bulk liquid storage terminal business and gas production and distribution business

table of contents pending acquisition seven bar fbos on december   we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire of the shares in sun valley aviation  inc  sb aviation group  inc and seven bar aviation  inc  a group of entities that own and operate three fbos  located in farmington and albuquerque  new mexico and sun valley  idaho 
we expect to complete the transaction through our airport services business in the first quarter of the total purchase price is approximately million subject to working capital adjustments and a further million is expected to be incurred to cover transaction and integration costs 
the purchase will be financed using part of the million drawdown on our mic inc revolving acquisition credit facility 
equity offerings during the fourth quarter of  we completed an offering of an aggregate of  shares of trust stock at a price per share of for which we received net proceeds of million 
the net cash proceeds from the equity offering and the sales of our interests in mcg and sew were primarily used to repay in full indebtedness under the mic inc acquisition credit facility used to partially finance our acquisitions of imtt  tgc and fbos in our airport services business 
in the third quarter of  we completed an offering of an aggregate of  llc interests at a price per interest of for which we received proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees and expenses 
the net cash proceeds from the equity offering were used to partially finance the acquisitions of mercury and san jose within our airport services business 
impact of acquisitions on our results of operations results of the operations of each of our acquisitions are included in our consolidated results from the respective date of each acquisition 
these acquisitions resulted in significant increases in the recorded value of our property  equipment  land and leasehold interests in our intangible assets  including goodwill  airport contract rights  customer relationships and technology  and in depreciation and amortization expense 
our acquisition of of imtt holdings is reflected in our equity in earnings losses and amortization charges of investee line in our financial statements from may  we have financed a significant portion of our acquisitions with debt incurred at the business segment level  other than our investment in imtt 
the increased levels of debt have resulted in significant increases in interest expense from the respective date of each acquisition 
operating segments and businesses airport services business our airport services business depends upon the level of general aviation activity  and jet fuel consumption  for the largest portion of its revenue 
general aviation activity is in turn a function of economic and demographic growth in the regions serviced by a particular airport and the general rate of economic growth in the united states 
a number of our airports are located near key business centers  for example  new york teterboro  chicago midway and philadelphia 
we believe the traffic generated by the businesses at these locations could help our fbos at these locations grow at a faster rate than the industry average nationwide 
fuel revenue is a function of the volume sold at each location and the average per gallon sale price 
the average per gallon sale price is a function of our cost of fuel plus  where applicable  fees and taxes paid to airports or other local authorities for each gallon sold cost of revenue fuel  plus our margin 
our fuel gross profit fuel revenue less cost of revenue fuel depends on the volume of fuel sold and the average dollar based margin earned per gallon 
the dollar based margin charged to customers varies based on business considerations 
dollar based margins per gallon are relatively insensitive to the wholesale price of fuel with both increases and decreases in the wholesale price of fuel generally passed through to customers  subject to the level of price competition that exists at the various fbos 
our airport services business also earns revenue from activities other than fuel sales non fuel revenue 
for example  our airport services business earns revenue from refueling some general aviation customers and some commercial airlines on a pass through basis  where we act as a fueling agent for fuel suppliers and 
table of contents for commercial airlines  receiving a fee  generally on a per gallon basis 
in addition  our airport services business earns revenue from aircraft landing and parking fees and by providing general aviation customers with other services  such as de icing and hangar rental 
at some facilities we also provide de icing services to commercial airlines 
our airport services business also earns management fees for its operation of six regional airports under management contracts 
in generating non fuel revenue  our airport services business incurs supply expenses cost of revenue non fuel  such as de icing fluid costs and payments to airport authorities  which vary from site to site 
cost of revenue non fuel is directly related to the volume of services provided and therefore generally increases in line with non fuel revenue in dollar terms 
our airport services business incurs expenses in operating and maintaining each fbo  such as rent and insurance  which are generally fixed in nature 
other expenses incurred in operating each fbo  such as salaries  generally increase with the level of activity 
in addition  our airport services business incurs general and administrative expenses at the head office that include senior management expenses as well as accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance and other corporate costs 
bulk liquid storage terminal business imtt provides bulk liquid storage and handling services in north america through ten terminals located on the east  west and gulf coasts  the great lakes region of the united states and partially owned terminals in quebec and newfoundland  canada 
the company has its largest terminals in the strategically key locations of new york harbor and the lower mississippi river near new orleans 
imtt stores and handles petroleum products  various chemicals  renewable fuels  and vegetable and animal oils and  based on storage capacity  operates one of the largest third party bulk liquid storage terminal businesses in the united states 
the key drivers of imtt s revenue and gross profit include the amount of tank capacity rented to customers and the rental rates 
customers generally rent tanks under contracts with terms of between three and five years that require payment regardless of actual tank usage 
demand for storage capacity within a particular region eg new york harbor serves as the key driver of storage capacity utilization and tank rental rates 
this demand for capacity reflects both the level of consumption of the bulk liquid products stored by the terminals as well as import and export activity of such products 
we believe major increases in the supply of new bulk liquid storage capacity in imtt s key markets has been and will continue to be limited by the availability of waterfront land with access to the infrastructure necessary for land based receipt and distribution of stored product road  rail and pipelines  lengthy environmental permitting processes and high capital costs 
we believe a favorable supply demand balance for bulk liquid storage currently exists in the markets serviced by imtt s major facilities 
this condition  when combined with the attributes of imtt s facilities such as deep water drafts and access to land based infrastructure  have allowed imtt to increase prices while maintaining very high storage capacity utilization rates 
imtt earns revenue at its terminals from a number of sources including storage of bulk liquids per barrel  per month rental  throughput of liquids handling charges  heating a pass through of the cost associated with heating liquids to prevent excessive viscosity and other revenue from blending  packaging and warehousing  for example 
most customer contracts include provisions for annual price increases based on inflation 
in operating its terminals  imtt incurs labor costs  fuel costs  repair and maintenance costs  real and personal property taxes and other costs which include insurance and other operating costs such as utilities and inventory used in packaging and drumming activities 
in  imtt generated approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its bayonne  nj facility  which services new york harbor  and approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its st 
rose  la  gretna  la and avondale  la facilities  which together service the lower mississippi river region with st 
rose being the largest contributor 
two key factors will likely have a material impact on imtt s total terminal revenue and terminal gross profit in the future 
first  imtt has achieved substantial increases in storage rates at its bayonne and st 
rose facilities over the past few years and some customers have already agreed to extend contracts that do not 
table of contents expire until and at rates above the existing rates under such contracts 
based on the current level of demand for bulk liquid storage in new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  we anticipate that imtt will achieve annual increases in storage revenue in excess of inflation at least through second  imtt has committed significant growth capital expenditure over the past two years that should contribute to terminal gross profit in and beyond as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
as prescribed in the shareholders agreement between us  imtt holdings and its other shareholders  until december   subject to compliance with law  the debt covenants applicable to its subsidiaries and retention of appropriate levels of reserves  imtt holdings is required to distribute million per quarter to us 
we received million in cash during  including million that was accrued at the end of at december   we accrued million for the fourth quarter distribution  which was received in january subsequent to december   subject to the same limitations applicable prior to december  and subject to imtt holdings consolidated adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio not exceeding as at each quarter end  imtt holdings is required to distribute  quarterly  all of its consolidated cash flow from operations and cash flows from but not used in investing activities less maintenance and environmental remediation capital expenditure to its shareholders 
based on current market conditions and assuming completion of the new geismar facility and several other expansion opportunities during  it is anticipated that imtt s total terminal revenue  terminal gross profit and cash flow provided by operating activities will increase significantly through  enabling the current level of annual distributions from imtt to us to be maintained beyond our interest in imtt holdings  from the date of closing our acquisition  may   is reflected in our equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee line in our consolidated statements of operations 
cash distributions received by us in excess of our equity in imtt s earnings and amortization charges are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities under return on investment in unconsolidated business 
gas production and distribution business tgc is a hawaii limited liability company that owns and operates the regulated synthetic natural gas production and distribution business in hawaii and distributes and sells liquefied petroleum gas through unregulated operations 
tgc operates in both regulated and unregulated markets on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
the hawaii market includes hawaii s approximate million resident population and approximate million annual visitors 
tgc has two primary businesses  utility or regulated and non utility or unregulated the utility business includes distribution and sales of sng on the island of oahu and distribution and sale of lpg to approximately  customers through localized distribution systems located on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai listed by size of market 
utility revenue consists principally of sales of thermal units  or therms  of sng and gallons of lpg 
one gallon of lpg is the equivalent of therms 
the operating costs for the utility business include the cost of locally purchased feedstock  the cost of manufacturing sng from the feedstock  lpg purchase costs and the cost of distributing sng and lpg to customers 
the non utility business comprises the sale of lpg to approximately  customers  through truck deliveries to individual tanks located on customer sites on oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
non utility revenue consists of sales of gallons of lpg 
the operating costs for the non utility business include the cost of purchased lpg and the cost of distributing the lpg to customers 
sng and lpg have a wide number of commercial and residential applications  including electricity generation  water heating  drying  cooking  and gas lighting 
lpg is also used as a fuel for some automobiles  specialty vehicles and forklifts 
gas customers range from residential customers for which tgc has nearly all of the market  to a wide variety of commercial customers 
revenue is primarily a function of the volume of sng and lpg consumed by customers and the price per thermal unit or gallon charged to customers 
because both sng and lpg are derived from petroleum  revenue levels  without volume changes  will generally track global oil prices 
utility revenue includes fuel 
table of contents adjustment charges through which the changes in fuel costs are passed through to utility customers 
as a result  the key measure of performance for this business is contribution margin 
volume is primarily driven by demographic and economic growth in the state of hawaii and by shifts of end users between gas and other energy sources and competitors 
the hawaii department of business  economic development  and tourism has forecast population growth for the state of per year through there are approximately entities regulated by the hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  excluding transportation businesses 
they include one gas utility  four electric utilities  water and sewage utilities and telecommunications utilities 
the four electric utility operators  combined  serve approximately  customers 
since all businesses and residences have electrical connections  this provides an estimate of the total gas market potential 
tgc s regulated customer base is approximately  and its non regulated customer base is approximately  accordingly  tgc s overall market penetration  as a percentage of total electric utility customers in hawaii  is approximately of hawaii businesses and residences 
tgc has of hawaii s regulated gas business and approximately of hawaii s unregulated gas business 
prices charged by tgc to its customers for the utility gas business are based on hpuc regulated rates that allow tgc the opportunity to recover its costs of providing utility gas service  including operating expenses  taxes  a return of capital investments through recovery of depreciation and a return on the capital invested 
tgc s rate structure generally allows it to maintain a relatively consistent dollar based margin per thermal unit by passing increases or decreases in fuel costs to customers through the fuel adjustment charges without filing a general rate case 
tgc incurs expenses in operating and maintaining its facilities and distribution network  comprising a sng plant  a mile transmission line   miles of distribution pipelines  several tank storage facilities and a fleet of vehicles 
these costs are generally fixed in nature 
other operating expenses incurred  such as lpg  feedstock for the sng plant and revenue based taxes  are generally sensitive to the volume of product sold 
in addition  tgc incurs general and administrative expenses at its executive office that include expenses for senior management  accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance  regulatory compliance  employee benefits  rents  utilities  insurance and other normal business costs 
the rates that are charged to non utility customers are set based on lpg and delivery costs  and on the cost of fuel and competitive factors 
as part of the regulatory approval process of our acquisition of tgc  we agreed to regulatory conditions addressing a variety of matters 
the more significant conditions include the non recoverability of goodwill  transaction or transition costs in future rate cases  a limitation on tgc s ability to file for a new rate case with a prospective test year commencing prior to  a requirement to limit tgc and hgc s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital to  a requirement to maintain million in readily available cash resources at tgc  hgc or the company  a requirement that tgc revise its fuel adjustment clause to reconcile monthly charges to corresponding actually incurred fuel expenses  and a requirement that tgc provide a million customer appreciation credit from a vendor funded escrow account to its gas customers 
district energy business our district energy business is comprised of thermal chicago and northwind aladdin  which are and indirectly owned by us 
thermal chicago sells chilled water to approximately customers in the chicago downtown area and one customer outside of the downtown area under long term contracts 
pursuant to these contracts  thermal chicago receives both capacity and consumption payments 
capacity payments cooling capacity revenue are received irrespective of the volume of chilled water used by a customer and these payments generally increase in line with inflation 

table of contents consumption payments cooling consumption revenue are a per unit charge for the volume of chilled water used 
such payments are higher in the second and third quarters of each year when the demand for chilled water is at its highest 
consumption payments also fluctuate moderately from year to year depending on weather conditions 
by contract  consumption payments generally increase in line with a number of economic indices that reflect the cost of electricity  labor and other input costs relevant to the operations of thermal chicago 
the weighting of the individual economic indices broadly reflects the composition of thermal chicago s direct expenses 
thermal chicago s principal direct expenses in were electricity  labor  operations and maintenance  depreciation and accretion and other 
electricity usage fluctuates in line with the volume of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago particularly focuses on minimizing the amount of electricity consumed per unit of chilled water produced by operating its plants to maximize efficient use of electricity 
other direct expenses  including labor  operations and maintenance  depreciation  and general and administrative are largely fixed irrespective of the volumes of chilled water produced 
in  the illinois electricity generation market was deregulated as discussed under our businesses and investments district energy business business thermal chicago operations electricity costs in part i  item business 
thermal has entered into a contract with a retail energy supplier to provide for the supply of the majority of our electricity at a fixed price and the remainder is a cost passed through to us from a customer 
we estimate our electricity costs will increase on a per unit basis by over which we pass through to customers 
we will need to enter into supply contracts for and subsequent years which may result in further increases in our electricity costs 
future rate cases or rehearings with the icc may also increase our electricity costs 
on january   and based on provisions of their contracts  the escalation for the electricity cost changes in consumption revenue were reflected as actual increases or decreases in thermal chicago s electricity cost 
northwind aladdin provides cold and hot water and back up electricity under two long term contracts that expire in february pursuant to these contracts  northwind aladdin receives monthly fixed payments of approximately million per annum through march and monthly fixed payments of approximately million per year thereafter through february in addition  northwind aladdin receives consumption and other variable payments from its customers that allow it to recover substantially all of its operating costs 
approximately of total contract payments are received from the planet hollywood resort and casino and the balance from the miracle mile shopping mall formerly known as the desert passage shopping mall 
airport parking business the revenue of our airport parking business includes both parking and non parking components 
parking revenue  which accounts for the substantial majority of total revenue is driven by the volume of passengers using the airports at which the business operates  its market share at each location and its parking rates 
non parking revenue includes primarily transportation services 
our parking business customers pay a fee for parking at its locations 
the parking fees collected constitute revenue earned 
the prices charged are a function of demand  quality of service and competition 
parking rate increases are often led by on airport parking lots and changes in the competitive environment 
most airports have historically increased parking rates rapidly with increases in demand  creating a favorable pricing environment for off airport competitors 
however  in certain markets  the airport may not raise rates in line with general economic trends 
further  our airport parking business seeks to increase parking rates through the value added services such as valet parking  car washes and covered parking 
turnover and intra day activity are captured in the cars out or total number of customers exiting during the period 
this measure  in combination with average parking revenue per car out and average overnight occupancy  are primary indicators of our price and volume dynamics 
average parking revenue is a function of the fee for parking  the discount applied  if any  and the number of days the customer is parked at the facility 
for example  an increase in average parking revenue over time can be a result of increased pricing  reduced discounting or an increase in the average length of stay 

table of contents in the discussion of our airport parking business results of operations  we disclose the average overnight occupancy for each period 
our airport parking business measures occupancy by counting the number of cars at the lowest point of the day between am and am every night 
at this time  customer activity is low  and thus an accurate measure of the car count may be taken at each location 
this method means that turnover and intra day activity are not taken into account and therefore occupancy during the day is likely to be higher than when the counts are undertaken 
in providing parking services  our airport parking business incurs expenses  such as personnel costs  real estate related costs and the costs of operating and maintaining its shuttle buses 
these costs are incurred in providing customers with service at each parking lot as well as in transporting them to and from the airport terminal 
generally  as the level of occupancy  or usage  at each of the business locations increases  labor and the other costs related to the operation of each facility increase 
we also incur costs related to damaged cars either as a result of the actions of our employees or criminal activity 
the business is continually reviewing security and safety measures to minimize these costs 
other costs incurred by our airport parking business relate to the provision of the head office function  including marketing and advertising  rents and other general and administrative expenses 
results of operations key factors affecting operating results positive contributions to our results arising from the acquisitions of the supermarine  mercury and san jose fbos by our airport services business in  a full year of equity accounting relating to the acquisition of of imtt that we completed on may   the earnings of which are reflected in equity in losses earnings and amortization charges of investees  a full year of operations from tgc and trajen fbos in  which we acquired on june  and july   respectively  increased consolidated gross profit driven by improved performance at our existing businesses  particularly our airport services business  the sale of our foreign investments in  higher management fees  including the million performance fees earned by our manager in compared with million in  both of which were reinvested in stock  and higher base management fees due to our increased market capitalization  and an increase in interest expense due to the overall increase in our debt to partially fund our acquisitions 
during  we received million in cash distributions from imtt  compared with million in  which is recorded as a reduction in our investment in unconsolidated business on our balance sheet 
we received a further million from imtt in january

acquisitions include the results of trajen fbos acquired july  for the period january to june  only  supermarine fbos acquired may  for the period may to december   mercury fbos acquired august  for the period august to december   san jose fbos acquired august  for the period august to december  and rifle fbos acquired november  for the period november to december  results for the existing locations column include trajen s results from july to december in and july to december in 
table of contents revenue and gross profit most of the revenue and gross profit in our airport services business is generated through fueling general aviation aircraft at our fbos around the united states 
this revenue is categorized according to who owns the fuel we use to service these aircraft 
if we own the fuel  we record our cost to purchase that fuel as cost of revenue fuel 
our corresponding fuel revenue is our cost to purchase that fuel plus a margin 
we generally pursue a strategy of maintaining  and where appropriate increasing  dollar margins  thereby passing any increase in fuel prices to the customer 
we also have into plane arrangements whereby we fuel aircraft with fuel owned by another party 
we collect a fee for this service that is recorded as non fuel revenue 
other non fuel revenue includes various services such as hangar rentals  de icing and airport services 
cost of revenue non fuel includes our cost  if any  to provide these services 
the key factors for our revenue and gross profit are fuel volume and dollar margin per gallon 
this applies to both fuel and into plane revenue 
our customers will occasionally move from one category to the other 
therefore  we believe discussing our fuel and non fuel revenue and gross profit and the related key metrics on a combined basis provides a more meaningful analysis of our airport services business 
our total gross profit growth was due to several factors inclusion of the results of acquisitions  higher non military fuel volumes for existing locations  an increase in average dollar per gallon fuel margins at existing locations  resulting largely from a higher proportion of transient customers  which generally pay higher margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the addition of expense associated with the integration and rebranding of the acquired locations 
the increase at our existing locations is a result of increased compensation expense  including non cash benefits  in addition to higher credit card fees and increased maintenance and repair costs 
interest expense  net the increase in total interest expense is due to the increased debt level associated with acquisitions in  including borrowings of million to partially finance our acquisition of supermarine  borrowings of million to partially finance our acquisition of mercury and borrowings of million to partially finance our acquisition of san jose 
in october  we refinanced all existing debt into a new term debt facility for million  a million capital expenditure facility and a million working capital revolving facility 
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt comprised a non cash million write off of deferred finance costs  associated with the refinancing in the fourth quarter of ebitda excluding the non cash loss from derivative instruments and non cash loss on extinguishment of debt  ebitda at existing locations and total ebitda would have increased by approximately and  respectively 
ebitda growth was driven by increased average dollar per gallon fuel margins  and inclusion of the results of acquisitions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results contribution of positive operating results from ear since our acquisition in august  contribution of positive operating results from trajen fbos acquired in july  higher dollar per gallon fuel margins and higher volumes at existing locations  
table of contents increased fuel prices resulting in higher fuel sales revenue and costs of goods sold  higher selling  general and administrative costs at existing locations primarily relating to increased non cash compensation expense  office rent and utility costs and increased credit card fees resulting from higher revenue  costs incurred for the rebranding and integration of the trajen locations  and higher interest costs from higher debt levels resulting from the refinancing in december and the increased borrowings related to the trajen acquisition

acquisitions include the results of the ear fbo acquired august  for the period january to july  only and trajen fbos acquired july  for the period july  to december revenue and gross profit our total revenue and gross profit growth was due to several factors 
table of contents inclusion of the results of ear for the full year of  inclusion of the results of trajen from july   rising cost of fuel at existing locations  which we generally pass on to customers  and an increase in fuel volumes and higher average dollar per gallon fuel margins at existing locations  resulting largely from a higher proportion of transient customers  which generally pay higher margins  partially offset by lower de icing activity in the first quarter of due to milder weather in the northeast us our operations at new orleans  la and gulfport  ms were impacted by hurricane katrina 
some of our hangar and terminal facilities were damaged 
however  our results were not significantly affected by these events 
we believe that we have an appropriate level of insurance coverage to repair or rebuild our facilities and protect us from business interruption losses that we may experience due to future hurricanes or similar events 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to increased non cash compensation expense largely due to the issuance of stock appreciation rights in the first quarter of  additional credit card fees related to increased fuel revenue  and additional office costs resulting from higher rent and utility costs 
depreciation and amortization expense the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the addition of the las vegas fbo in and trajen in interest expense  net excluding a million impact of deferred financing costs that were charged to expense in connection with a december refinancing  interest expense increased in due to the increased debt level associated with the debt refinancing and the acquisition of trajen and higher non cash amortization of deferred financing costs 
in december  we refinanced two existing debt facilities with a single debt facility  increasing outstanding borrowings by million 
in july  we increased borrowings under this facility again by million to partially finance our acquisition of trajen 
ebitda the increase in ebitda from existing locations  excluding the non cash losses gains on derivative instruments  is due to increased fuel volumes and higher average dollar per gallon fuel margins  lower other expense due to transaction costs incurred in relating to our acquisition of two fbos in california  partially offset by lower de icing revenue in  and higher selling  general and administrative costs 
bulk liquid storage terminal business we account for our investment in the bulk liquid storage terminal business under the equity method 
we recognized a  loss in our consolidated results for in addition to our share of imtt s net income of million  we recorded additional depreciation and amortization expense net of taxes which offset this income

table of contents to enable meaningful analysis of imtt s performance across periods  imtt s performance for the years ended december  is discussed below  including the period prior to our ownership 
key factors affecting operating results terminal revenue and terminal gross profit increased principally due to increases in average tank rental rates and storage capacity rented to customers  increases in throughput revenue  and increases in revenue from the provision of other services

year ended december  change favorable unfavorable imtt imtt excl 
quebec imtt excl 
quebec in thousands unaudited total revenue     total operating costs    total gross profit     operating income     ebitda     to provide a more meaningful comparison of current and previous year results  the following discussion and analysis of financial results will compare the imtt excluding quebec results to the actual results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and gross profit terminal revenue increased  reflecting an increase of million in storage revenue as well as growth in every other major service segment 
in contracts signed during  imtt often achieved substantial rate increases 
as a result  the average rental rates charged to customers increased by over the previous year 
storage capacity rented increased by while utilization during reached compared to during the previous year 
in addition to increased storage revenue  terminal revenue growth also benefited from increases of million in throughput and million in heating charges 
other services and fees increased million due to increased packaging activities at lemont  charges for dock usage at geismar  and customer reimbursements for capital projects completed at bayonne  which are recognized ratably as revenue over the contract term 
gross profit from terminal services increased  reflecting the increase in terminal revenue partially offset by increased operating costs 
direct labor costs rose as staffing increased to accommodate expansion projects at st 
rose and the pending start up of the geismar site 
repair and maintenance expenses increased due to higher cleaning costs associated with tank inspections 
increased packaging activities at lemont also increased expenses related to packaging consumables 
the increase in costs along with revenue resulted in a limited increase in gross margin 
going forward  we anticipate that costs will increase at a slower rate than revenue and gross margin will increase as a result 
revenue from environmental response services increased by million  reflecting increases in materials sales and other services partially offset by decreased revenue from spill response 
this shift in revenue mix accounted for the million decrease in gross profit from environmental response services 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by million as imtt completed several capacity expansion projects and other major capital expenditures 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased due to the repayment of higher rate private placement debt with lower rate debt from the new revolving credit facility in june subsequently  the issuance of low interest go zone bonds in july allowed imtt to repay debt obtained through the new revolving credit facility 

table of contents loss on extinguishment of debt during the second quarter  imtt repaid two tranches of senior notes in conjunction with the establishment of a new million revolving credit facility 
as a result  imtt incurred a million loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of the associated make whole payment 
other income other income includes one time items as well as gross profit from nursery operations 
during  other income increased by million over the previous year due to gains of million on insurance settlements received for claims related to hurricane katrina and a reduction in losses from the nursery partially offset by favorable legal settlements and the write off of payables during unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments as part of financing activities during  imtt entered into additional interest rate swap arrangements to fix the effective interest rate on the new debt facilities 
imtt does not apply hedge accounting 
as a result  movements in the fair value of interest rate derivatives held by imtt are taken through earnings and reported in the unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments line in the imtt financial statements 
ebitda excluding non cash losses gains on derivative instruments and the loss on extinguishment of debt  ebitda would have increased by approximately  primarily due to the increase in gross profit discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and gross profit terminal revenue increased primarily due to an increase in storage revenue caused by a increase in aggregate rented storage capacity and a increase in average storage rates in overall rented storage capacity increased slightly from to of available storage capacity in the increase in storage revenue was offset by reduced packaging revenue due to the closure of packaging operations at bayonne in the first quarter of in  imtt also achieved a million improvement in the differential between terminal revenue heating and terminal operating costs fuel due to a one time refund of million for fuel metering discrepancies received in the fourth quarter of and implementation of cost saving measures 
the increase in terminal revenue was partially offset by an increase in terminal operating costs other than terminal generating costs fuel 
this increase was principally due to increases in direct labor  health benefit and repair and maintenance costs offset partially by a non cash natural resource damage settlement accrual of million in the second quarter of that did not recur in environmental response gross profit decreased in due to a large contribution in from spill clean up activities resulting from hurricane katrina 
the nursery gross profit decreased due to a reduction in demand for plants in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and higher delivery costs due to increases in fuel costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased slightly reflecting  of costs incurred by imtt during when it temporarily relocated its head office from new orleans to bayonne in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased due to increased growth capital expenditure 
gas production and distribution business we completed our acquisition of tgc on june  therefore  tgc only contributed to our consolidated operating results from that date 

table of contents because tgc s results of operations are only included in our consolidated financial results for less than seven months of  the following analysis compares the historical results of operations for tgc under its current and prior owner 
we believe that this is the most appropriate approach to analyzing the historical financial performance and trends of tgc 
key factors affecting operating results increased utility contribution margin due principally to non recurrence of customer rebates provided in the third quarter of  partially offset by higher fuel cost adjustments and customer mix of lower margin sales  and increased non utility contribution margin primarily due to price increases during  partially offset by higher cost of fuel and increased costs to deliver lpg to oahu s neighboring islands 
management analyzes contribution margin for tgc because it believes that contribution margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to understanding the performance of tgc utility operations under its regulated rate structure and of its non utility operations under a competitive pricing structure 
both structures provide the business with an ability to change rates when underlying feedstock costs change 
contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income  or net income  which are determined in accordance with us gaap 
we calculate contribution margin as revenue less direct costs of revenue other than production and transmission and distribution costs 
other companies may calculate contribution margin differently or may use different metrics and  therefore  the contribution margin presented for tgc is not necessarily comparable with metrics of other companies

nm not meaningful corporate allocation expense has been excluded from the above table as it is eliminated on consolidation at the mic inc level 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  contribution margin and operating income the utility contribution margin increased primarily due to the non recurrence of million of customer rebates that were made in as required by hawaii state regulators as a condition of our purchase of tgc  partially offset by higher fuel cost adjustments in as these adjustments commenced in june upon our acquisition  and customer mix of lower margin sales 
the cash effect of the fuel cost adjustments was offset by withdrawals from an escrow account that was established and funded at acquisition by the seller 
tgc believes that these escrowed funds will be fully utilized by mid and thereafter escrowed funds would not be available 
the cash reimbursements of the customer rebate and any fuel cost adjustment amounts are not reflected in revenue  but rather are reflected as releases of restricted cash and other assets 
therm sales for the utility operations were slightly higher than in  however  this was primarily from lower margin customers 
the non utility contribution margin increased due to customer price increases and slightly higher therm sales  partially offset by higher costs of lpg and increases in the cost to transport lpg between islands 
production costs were higher due primarily to higher rent and personnel costs  partially offset by lower electricity and materials costs 
transmission and distribution costs were higher due principally to higher personnel costs  adjustments to reserves for asset retirement costs and government required pipeline inspection costs 
selling  general and administrative costs were higher due to higher personnel  employee benefits and professional service costs 
the costs in included overhead charges by the prior parent company during the period of their ownership in depreciation and amortization increased due to the higher asset basis that resulted from our purchase of tgc and for capital additions 
tgc s supply agreement for feedstock used in its sng plants expires during consistent with current practices  we believe the prices for the feedstock will be increased upon entering into a new contract and that we will be able to pass through this increase to utility customers 
however  the new contract and the ability to pass through these costs will likely require approval by the hawaii public utilities commission 
tgc s supply agreements for lpg also expire in we believe that  due to higher petroleum prices  the cost of lpg will likely be higher under new agreements 
to the extent that the company is unable to recover all of these higher prices through customer price increases or that the higher prices reduce tgc s competitive position vis vis other energy sources  the company s sales volumes and margins could be adversely affected 
interest expense  net interest expense increased due to our acquisition funding 
interest expense in included the prior owner s write off of deferred financing costs for the retirement of their debt in connection with their sale of the business 
other expense income other expense for included million of transaction costs incurred prior to our ownership 
ebitda ebitda was higher in compared with excluding the effects of the customer rebates and non cash derivative losses  ebitda would have decreased by approximately 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results utility revenue was reduced by million in for two billing adjustments required by hawaii regulators as a condition to our acquisition  million of which was non recurring 
we received cash reimbursement for the full amount through two escrow accounts that were established as purchase price adjustments when we acquired tgc  
table of contents utility therm sales slightly increased in due primarily to increased usage by a single low margin interruptible customer  non utility contribution margin increased primarily due to price increases partially offset by a customer s closing of a propane cogeneration unit and lower overall sales volumes  operating and overhead costs increased due to an increase in personnel and associated benefit costs  increased repair costs for distribution systems and transmission line inspections and higher utility costs  and non cash unrealized losses on derivatives that resulted from changes in value of these instruments 
contribution margin and operating income tgc s total contribution margin and operating income declined primarily due to a million customer rebate  as described above 
in addition  hawaii state regulators required tgc to modify its calculation of cost of fuel increases that are passed through to utility customers 
therms sold in the non utility sector decreased for the year principally due to the customer s closing of a propane powered cogeneration unit at its resort  as well as customer renovations and energy conservation measures 
lower therms sold were more than offset by an increase in non utility contribution margin primarily reflecting rate increases implemented since late production and transmission and distribution costs were higher than in due primarily to increased personnel and associated benefits costs  increased pipeline and plant repair costs  additional costs related to a us department of transportation mandated transmission pipeline inspection program and higher utility costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were comparable between and the absence of the prior owner s overhead allocations since our acquisition was partially offset by increased personnel and associated employee benefit costs  purchase transaction costs  and increased consulting costs 
depreciation and amortization was higher for the year due to capital additions and the higher asset basis following our purchase of tgc in june interest expense  net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in total debt resulting from our acquisition funding and prepayment fees of approximately million expensed by tgc s previous owner following early retirement of certain debt 
other expense income other expense for included million of costs incurred by the prior owners for their sale of tgc to us 
other income for included a million payment from an electric utility company to reimburse tgc under a cost sharing arrangement  for entry into an energy corridor fuel pipeline right of way 
unrealized losses on derivative instruments during  tgc recognized a non cash expense of million as a result of a decrease in the carrying value of the derivative instruments 
these derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges as of january   and we expect most of the future changes in fair value to be reflected in other comprehensive loss income on the balance sheet 
ebitda the decline in ebitda is due in large part to the customer rebate and the change in fuel adjustment calculations that were discussed above for which we have been reimbursed  as well as non cash unrealized losses on derivatives reflecting the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swaps 
excluding the effects of the customer rebates and non cash derivative losses  ebitda would have decreased by approximately

gross profit gross profit for decreased slightly primarily due to lower ton hour sales from cooler weather and higher electric costs related to required changes to market based energy supply contracts at three of our plants  which commenced in may these increased costs were partially offset by the conversion of several interruptible customers to firm  annual inflation related increases of contract capacity rates and scheduled increases in contract consumption rates in accordance with the terms of existing customer contracts 
additionally  electric cost increases were mitigated by efficient operation of the downtown system s chilled water plants 
other revenue increased due to our pass through to customers of the higher cost of natural gas consumables  which are included in other direct expenses 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher legal and third party consulting fees related to strategy work in preparation for the deregulation of illinois electricity market offset by the effects of adopting a new long term incentive plan for management employees in the first quarter of that required a net reduction in the liability previously accrued under the former plan

line 
gif 
cars out refers to the total number of customers exiting during the period 
average overnight occupancy refers to aggregate average daily occupancy measured for all locations at the lowest point of the day and does not reflect turnover and intra day activity 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue for increased due to the addition of one new airport parking location  one new third party contract location and an increase in revenue per car  offset by a decrease in volume 
average revenue per car out increased for the year at our comparable locations primarily due to our ongoing yield management strategy  including price increases and elimination of low yield daily airport employee parkers in selected locations 
our continued focus on improved customer service has supported our price increases 
cars out at comparable locations declined over the prior year due to a strategic shift away from daily parkers and continued competitive pressure in selected markets 
in several key markets competitive pressure has eroded market share 
to counter the market share erosion  management has implemented a strategy of aggressive pricing  service level improvements  and a larger sales force 
management has continued to focus on improving results in underperforming markets  and expects that improved service levels  internet marketing  strategic pricing  and an increased sales force will re build our customer base over time 
as a result  we expect to see improved revenues over the medium term 
direct expenses direct expenses increased due in part to additional costs associated with operating one new location  and to support management s strategy to improve our customers experience with increased and improved staffing  shuttle operations  and security 
direct expenses include rent in excess of lease  a non cash item  of million for each of the years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to personnel and travel expenses associated with the implementation of a new regional operations and sales management structure  however much of the annual increase relates to items we do not expect to recur  such as rebranding expenses 
we are currently in litigation in selected markets regarding our new brand name  fasttrack airport parking  which has resulted in increased legal expenses and  depending on the outcome  may result in further legal and rebranding expenses and may impact the timing of expected customer base growth 
amortization of intangibles amortization in included a non cash million impairment charge relating to our rebranding project 
interest expense  net interest expense declined in due to favorable terms associated with the debt refinanced on september   that consolidated our primary borrowings  and provided funding for capital expenditures at a more favorable interest rate 
in addition  we had fewer shuttle buses financed under capital leases in compared with ebitda ebitda decreased due lower gross profit and higher selling  general and administrative expenses  mainly as a result of investments in customer service and corporate structure that are expected to generate future revenue growth 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the first quarter of  we consolidated two adjacent facilities in philadelphia 
as part of this consolidation  the avistar philadelphia facility was effectively closed and its capacity made available to the sunpark philadelphia facility 
during the third quarter of  we ceased operating the avistar st 
louis location and consolidated the facility into our sunpark st 
louis facility 
we refer to these consolidated operations as new locations for in the discussion below 

table of contents key factors affecting operating results contribution from new locations  price increases and reduced discounting in selected markets contributed to the increase in average revenue per car out for comparable locations during the year  marketing efforts targeted at customers with a longer average stay increased average overnight occupancy by for comparable locations during the year  improved operating margins at comparable locations  a cash settlement received and included in other income  a non cash impairment charge of million for existing trademarks and domain names due to a rebranding initiative 
revenue revenue increased due to the addition of nine new locations during and an increase in average revenue per car out at comparable locations 
in  new locations represent of our portfolio by number of locations and contributed of total revenue 
we believe the contribution from these facilities will continue to grow as customers continue to be exposed to our branding  marketing and service 
average revenue per car out increased at our comparable locations primarily due to implementation of our yield management strategy  including price increases and reduced discounting in selected markets and a new marketing program 
a focus on improving the level of customer service in certain locations has supported these price increases 
the decrease in cars out at comparable locations was attributed to a continued strategic shift away from daily parkers and a greater marketing emphasis on leisure travelers throughout daily parkers  typically airport employees  contribute to a higher number of cars out  but pay discounted rates 
leisure travelers tend to have longer average stays 
the lower average revenue per car out at new locations  relative to comparable locations  in reflects the acquisition of new locations in lower priced markets 
average overnight occupancies at comparable locations were up slightly as capacity expansions in select markets were fully utilized 
we believe average length of stay came under pressure during the second half of as some leisure travelers chose shorter vacations due to higher costs for air fares  hotel and rental cars 
our airport parking business as a whole has sufficient capacity to accommodate further growth 
at locations where we are operating at peak capacity intra day  we continue to evaluate and implement strategies to expand capacity of these locations 
for example  during we recovered additional capacity from a sub tenant  installed additional vehicle lifts and  during peak periods  offered customers valet service at self park facilities 
direct expenses direct expenses for increased primarily due to additional costs associated with operating nine new locations 
direct expenses at comparable locations were also affected by higher real estate  fuel and labor costs offset by lower claims from damaged cars  advertising and insurance premiums 
we intend to continue pursuing costs savings through standardization of staff scheduling to minimize overtime and a new bulk fuel purchase program that was implemented in august direct expenses include rent in excess of lease  a non cash item  in the amount of million and million for and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to higher payroll costs associated with the expansion of the management team to support additional locations  health insurance and professional fees 
non recurring costs in include the retirement of two members of senior management from the business  costs associated with a restructure of the finance function and higher legal expenses associated with scheduled union negotiations 

table of contents amortization of intangibles amortization increased largely as a result of impairment charges in the amount of million related to the trademarks and domain names previously acquired  partially offset by the elimination of amortization of non compete agreements that expired in december as a result of our rebranding initiative  we wrote down almost all of the value of our acquired trademarks and  as a result  amortization expense declined significantly beginning in interest expense  net interest expense increased due to the additional interest and finance cost amortization associated with the new debt issued in october to finance acquisitions 
on september  this debt and our other primary borrowing were refinanced with more favorable terms and  of finance costs related to the october financing were expensed 
interest expense also increased as a result of higher libor rates 
our two primary borrowings were subject to two interest rate hedges which effectively capped our interest rate when the day libor rate was 
in march the libor rate exceeded the cap rate 
as part of the refinance on september  one of these interest rate hedges was replaced with an interest rate swap at 
interest cap and swap payments totaling  were realized in this amount was recorded as a reduction in interest expense 
ebitda ebitda increased largely as a result of the acquisitions and improved profit margins at our comparable locations 
ebitda was also increased by the net proceeds from a settlement related to a prior year acquisition of  the increase in gross profit margins at our new locations in reflects the acquisition of locations predominantly on owned land compared to the leased locations at avistar philadelphia and avistar st 
louis 
liquidity and capital resources we do not intend to retain significant cash balances in excess of what are prudent reserves 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our future liquidity requirements  including in relation to our acquisition strategy and our dividend policy 
we base our assessment on the following assumptions all of our businesses and investments generate  and will continue to generate  significant operating cash flow  the ongoing maintenance capital expenditures associated with our businesses are modest and readily funded from their respective operating cash flow or available financing  including release of debt service reserves  all significant short term growth capital expenditure will be funded with cash on hand or from committed undrawn debt facilities  we have million of revolving acquisition financing available maturing in and will be able to raise equity to refinance any amounts borrowed in the future under our acquisition facility prior to its maturity  and we will be able to debt finance acquisitions and to refinance maturing debt on reasonable terms 
in light of current market conditions  assumptions regarding our ability to fund acquisitions may be subject to significant risk 
see risk factors in part i  item a 
the section below discusses the sources and uses of cash on a consolidated basis  and for each of our businesses and investments 
all inter company activities such as corporate allocation  capital contributions to our businesses and distributions from our businesses have been excluded from the tables below as these transactions are eliminated on consolidation

the long term debt represents the consolidated principal obligations to various lenders 
the debt facilities  which are obligations of the operating businesses and have maturities between and  are subject to certain covenants  the violation of which could result in acceleration 
the million in the years period includes a million term loan at our airport parking business  which is due for repayment in september this term loan has one year optional extensions  subject to meeting certain covenants  which we currently meet 
capital lease obligations are for the lease of certain transportation equipment 
such equipment could be subject to repossession upon violation of the terms of the lease agreements 
this represents the minimum annual rentals required to be paid under non cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year 
tgc currently has a time charter arrangement for the use of two barges for transporting liquefied petroleum gas between oahu and its neighbor islands 
purchase obligations include the commitment of the company through a wholly owned subsidiary at december  to acquire the seven bar fbos  which we expect to complete in the first quarter of the above table does not reflect certain long term obligations  such as deferred taxes  for which we are unable to estimate the period in which the obligation will be incurred 
in addition to these commitments and contingencies  we typically incur capital expenditures on a regular basis to maintain our existing revenue producing assets in good working order maintenance capital expenditures  and expand our existing revenue producing assets or acquire new ones growth capital expenditures 
see investing activities below for further discussion of capital expenditures 
we also have other contingencies  including pending threatened legal and administrative proceedings that are not reflected above as amounts at this time are not ascertainable 
see legal proceedings in part i  item our sources of cash to meet these obligations are as follows refinancing our current credit facilities on or before maturity see financing activities below  cash generated from our operations see operating activities below  and 
table of contents cash available from our undrawn credit facilities see financing activities below 
in addition to these obligations  we have historically paid regular and increasing cash distributions to our shareholders  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
these distributions are funded primarily from cash from operating activities 
we use the distributions we receive from imtt to partially fund our distributions to shareholders  part of which are included in cash from operating activities and part of which are included in cash from investing activities 
we also incur performance fees from time to time paid to our manager 
our manager has historically elected to reinvest these fees in our llc interests previously trust stock 
while these fees do not directly affect cash flows when paid in equity  they do increase the cash necessary to maintain and increase our distributions to shareholders  as they result in more outstanding llc interests 
we believe this increased cash requirement is mitigated by a lower cost of equity capital as the performance fees are earned only when our llc interests outperform benchmark indices

year ended december  change from to favorable unfavorable change from to favorable unfavorable in thousands cash provided by operating activities   cash used in investing activities      nm cash provided by financing activities      nm operating activities we believe our operating activities provide a source of sustainable and growing long term cash flow due to consistent customer demand driven by the basic everyday nature of the services provided  our strong competitive position due to factors including high initial development and construction costs  difficulty in obtaining suitable land near many of our operations for example  airports  waterfront near ports  long term concessions contracts  required government approvals  which may be difficult or time consuming to obtain  and lack of cost efficient alternatives to the services we provide in the foreseeable future  product service pricing that we expect to generally keep pace with inflation due to factors including consistent demand  limited alternatives  contractual terms  and regulatory rate setting 
consolidated cash provided by operating activities comprises the cash from operations of the businesses we own as described in each respective business discussion below 
the cash flow from our consolidated business operations is partially offset by expenses paid at the corporate level  such as base management fees  professional fees and interest on any amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility 
the increase in cash from operations in was due primarily to operating results of our airport services business  mainly from acquisitions during  and the full year effect of acquisitions during in addition  cash from operating activities from existing fbo sites increased due mainly to higher dollar per gallon fuel margins 
our district energy business also increased cash from operations due mainly to increased revenue from higher contracted capacity and higher consumption 
the increase in cash from operations in was due mainly to operating results of the acquisitions during noted above  as well as full year results from the august 
table of contents acquisition of the las vegas fbo  partially offset by interest in on our revolving credit facility incurred from the second quarter of until our equity offering in november investing activities the primary driver of cash used in investing activities in our consolidated cash flows has been acquisitions of businesses in new and existing segments and the dispositions of our non us businesses 
the other main driver is capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are generally funded by cash from operating activities and growth capital expenditures are generally funded by drawing on our available credit facilities or by equity capital 
we may fund maintenance capital expenditures from credit facilities or equity capital and growth capital expenditures from operating activities from time to time 
we expect that our growth capital expenditures will generally be yield accretive once placed in service 
acquisitions of businesses are generally funded on a long term basis through raising additional equity capital and or project financing style credit facilities 
we have drawn on our mic inc revolving credit facility to temporarily fund some acquisitions and may do so in the future 
we have repaid this facility in the past with proceeds from raising additional equity and or obtaining long term project financing style facilities and expect to do so in the future 
financing activities the primary driver of cash provided by financing activities are equity offerings  debt financing of acquisitions and the subsequent refinancing of our businesses 
a smaller portion of cash provided by financing activities relates to principal payments on capital leases and principal payments on the relatively small amount of our non amortizing debt 
the primary transactions contributing to our consolidated investing and financing cash flows include the acquisition of additional fbos  proceeds from issuance of equity and debt to finance these acquisitions  refinancing of debt in our airport services and district energy businesses  and sale of our investment in an offshore toll road concession in  for which we received the proceeds in acquisitions of our share of the bulk liquid storage terminal business  our investment in the gas production and distribution business  and additional fbos  proceeds from issuance of equity and debt to finance the above acquisitions  refinancing of debt at our airport parking business  and sale of our foreign investments in mcg and sew 
acquisitions of three fbos and six off airport parking facilities  issuance of debt to partially finance these acquisitions  and refinancing of debt at our airport services business 
our businesses are capitalized with a mix of equity and project financing style long term debt 
we believe we can prudently maintain relatively high levels of leverage due to the sustainable and growing long term cash flows our businesses have provided in the past and we expect to continue in the future as discussed above 
our long term debt is primarily non amortizing and we consider this to be permanent in nature 
most of our businesses debt is term debt  while some of our businesses also maintain capital expenditure and or working capital facilities 
we generally determine what we believe to be the optimal capital structure for a business as part of our acquisition process 
we implement that structure at acquisition by financing the appropriate amount of debt at the subsidiary level and contributing equity from proceeds of an equity offering and or cash on hand from previous offerings 
we maintain a revolving credit facility at the mic inc level to facilitate the acquisition process when we need temporary financing until we complete an equity offering and or debt financing at the 
table of contents subsidiary level 
we continue to actively assess and manage the capital structure of our businesses after acquisition  resulting in refinancing recurring typically every several years or more often 
mic inc acquisition credit facility on february  we renewed our existing million revolving credit facility 
the renewed facility is provided by the following lenders citicorp north america inc as lender and administrative agent  wachovia bank national association  credit suisse  cayman islands branch  westlb ag  new york branch  and macquarie finance americas inc we intend to use the revolving facility to fund acquisitions  capital expenditures and to a limited extent  working capital  pending refinancing through equity offerings at an appropriate time 
the facility can be increased in size to million by us  subject to certain terms and conditions 
no commitments have been received at this time for the million increase in the facility size 
there was no balance outstanding at december  on february   we drew million on this facility  part of which we will use to fund the acquisition of seven bar fbos which we expect to complete in the first quarter of  and part of which we will use for other projects 
macquarie finance americas inc  a related party  committed million to the million facility  of which million was drawn on february  as part of the million total drawdown 
the borrower under the facility is mic inc  a direct subsidiary of the company  and the obligations under the facility are guaranteed by the company and secured by a pledge of the equity of all current and future direct subsidiaries of mic inc and the company 
the terms and conditions for the revolving facility include events of default  representations and warranties and covenants that are generally customary for a facility of this type 
in addition  the revolving facility includes a restriction on cross guarantees and an event of default should the manager or another member of the macquarie group cease to manage our business and operations

it is anticipated that all proceeds from the issuance held by the trustee will be released to imtt by the end of the go zone bonds are fully credit supported by letters of credit drawn under imtt s revolving credit agreement 
for federal income tax purposes  interest on the go zone bonds is excluded from gross income and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of federal alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations that are investors in the go zone bonds  however  for purposes of computing the federal alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations  such interest is taken into account in determining adjusted current earnings 
as a consequence of this and the credit support provided by the letters of credit  the floating interest rate applicable to similar bonds has historically averaged approximately percent of libor 
interest on the go zone bonds is deductible to imtt as incurred except to the extent capitalized and amortized as part of project costs as required  for federal income tax purposes

the airport parking business has entered into an interest rate swap agreement for the million balance at through october  and for the full million through the maturity of the loan on september  the airport parking business obligations under the interest rate swap have been guaranteed by mic inc critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates and policies are discussed below 
these estimates and policies are consistent with the estimates and accounting policies followed by the businesses we own 
business combinations our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the airport services business  gas production and distribution business  district energy business and airport parking business include contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks  domain names  property and equipment and goodwill 
trademarks and domain names are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
trademarks  domain names and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances 
it may be appropriate to amortize some trademarks and domain names 
however  for unamortized intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which included the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the airport services business  gas production and distribution business  district energy business and airport parking business are separate reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the impairment test for trademarks and domain names which are not amortized requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademarks and domain names is less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or material negative change in relationship with significant customers 

table of contents property and equipment is initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in services assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
significant intangibles  including contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
with respect to contract rights in our airport services business  we take into consideration the history of contract right renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount of the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it is appropriate to do so 
we test goodwill for impairment as of october each year 
there was no goodwill impairment as of october  we test our long lived assets when there is an indicator of impairment 
impairments of long lived assets during and relating to our airport services business and airport parking business  respectively  are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in part ii  item revenue recognition fuel revenue from our airport services business is recorded when fuel is provided or when services are rendered 
our airport services business also records hangar rental fees  which are recognized during the month for which service is provided 
our gas production and distribution business recognizes revenue when the services are provided 
sales of gas to customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis 
most revenue is based upon consumption  however  certain revenue is based upon a flat rate 
our district energy business recognizes revenue from cooling capacity and consumption at the time of performance of service 
cash received from customers for services to be provided in the future are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized over the expected services period on a straight line basis 
our airport parking business records parking lot revenue  as services are performed  net of allowances and local taxes 
revenue for services performed  but not collected as of a reporting date  are recorded based upon the estimated value of uncollected parking revenue for customer vehicles at each location 
our airport parking business also offers various membership programs for which customers pay an annual membership fee 
such revenue is recognized ratably over the one year life of the membership 
revenue from prepaid parking vouchers that can be redeemed in the future is recognized when such vouchers are redeemed 
hedging with respect to our debt facilities  and the expected cash flows from our previously held non us investments  we entered into a series of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to provide an economic hedge of our interest rate and foreign exchange exposure 
we originally classified each hedge as a cash flow 
table of contents hedge at inception for accounting purposes 
as discussed in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements  in we determined that none of our derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting 
fasb no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended  requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values and  for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting  that changes in the fair value of the derivative be recognized in earnings 
the determination of fair value of these instruments involves estimates and assumptions and actual value may differ from the fair value reflected in the financial statements 
we commenced hedge accounting in january and have classified each interest rate derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge from this time 
changes in the value of the hedges  to the extent effective  will be recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
changes in the value that represent the ineffective portion of the hedge will be recorded in earnings as a gain or loss 
we did not have any foreign exchange derivatives as at december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the discussion that follows describes our exposure to market risks and the use of derivatives to address those risks 
see critical accounting estimates hedging for a discussion of the related accounting 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the borrowings of our businesses 
our current policy is to enter into derivative financial instruments to fix variable rate interest payments covering at least half of the interest rate risk associated with the borrowings of our businesses  subject to the requirements of our lenders 
as of december   we have total debt outstanding at our consolidated businesses of billion  most of which incurs interest at floating rates  with only million incurring a fixed rate of interest 
of the amount incurring interest at floating rates  billion is hedged with interest rate swaps  million is hedged with an interest rate cap and million is unhedged 
at february   we drew million on our revolving acquisition credit facility at mic inc  all of which is unhedged 
mic inc as of december   there was no outstanding balance on the mic inc revolving acquisition credit facility 
as of february   the outstanding balance was million 
a increase in the interest rate on the mic inc revolving acquisition credit facility would result in a  increase in the interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
airport services business as of december   the outstanding balance of the floating rate senior debt for our airport services business is million 
the senior debt of our airport service business is non amortizing through october a increase in the interest rate on the airport services business debt would result in a million increase in the interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
the exposure of the million term loan portion of the senior debt to interest rate changes has been hedged until october through the use of interest rate swaps 
these hedging arrangements will offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates during that period 
however  if interest rates decrease  the value of our hedge instruments will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the hedge instruments of million 
a corresponding relative increase would result in a million increase in the fair market value

the interest rate on the go zone bonds is reset daily or weekly at imtt s option by tender
