overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the bank since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker  thomas  and worth counties  each contiguous with colquitt county  and the surrounding counties of southwest georgia 
we have four full service banking facilities and six automated teller machines 
our strategy is to maintain the diversity of our revenue  including both interest and noninterest income through a broad base of business  strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees to provide the best possible service to our customers  expand our market share where opportunity exists  and grow outside of our current geographic market through acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
the corporation s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans  securities and federal funds sold  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
after holding banks overnight borrowing rate at for eight months of  the federal reserve bank decreased short term interest rates by to from september to year end 
our profitability is impacted as well by operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy costs and income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local factors such as changes in population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing uses of funds and investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation s primary market area 
to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
in addition  broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which is outside of our control 
as a result of our strategy to diversify revenue  noninterest income has grown over the last few years and was of net interest income 
sources of noninterest income include our insurance agency and empire  the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  as well as fees on customer accounts  trust and retail brokerage services 
in  we continued to focus on asset quality following significant improvements two years ago made with respect to overall asset quality 
at the end of  we had one large million fully secured loan in nonaccrual loans on which no loss is anticipated 
in  we had a single million nonaccrual loan which foreclosed and the collateral property was sold for a loss of  during the fourth quarter of tender offer on october   the corporation repurchased  shares of our common stock through a tender offer with a total cost of million 
the tender offer caused a decrease in the number of shares outstanding  stockholders equity and book and tangible book value per share 
the corporation s management and directors pursued the stock tender offer as an appropriate use of capital considering our lack of expansion opportunities  changes in our shareholder base  and our strong capital level which is significantly above minimum legal requirements 
we believed that the offer resulted in a balance sheet and capital structure more appropriate for the size and volume of the corporation s current operations 
critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates have on the corporation s results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate  however  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that would have resulted in material estimates and assumptions changes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
results of operations performance summary net income for was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  when compared with million in our net income was down primarily as a result of a million loss sustained during the fourth quarter by the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary realized as a result of covering the shortfall of participant banks related to a sale of foreclosed commercial property 
also  other decreases in annual net income were attributable to a decrease in interest income related to a lower earning asset base and a decline in revenue from mortgage banking services 
this decline was partially offset by a  gain on the sale of the corporation s retail credit card portfolio in september the sale of the credit card portfolio was a move to reduce the risk profile of the bank 
net income for was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  when compared with million in our net income was down primarily as a result of a  loss recognized in our investment securities portfolio in connection with funding the tender offer as well as  in administrative expenses related to the tender offer 
net income was also negatively impacted by a  decrease in mortgage banking income due to numerous payoffs of serviced loans at empire and accelerated amortization related to such payoffs of  a one time  pension contribution incurred in connection with the freezing of the pension plan and a decline in our net interest margin 
on a per share basis  net income for was down to per diluted share compared with per diluted share for we measure our performance on selected key ratios  which are provided for the last three years in the following table caption

net interest income net interest income for decreased  or  compared with major factors contributing to the decline in net interest income compared with were a decline of  in interest income on a lower volume of investment securities 
this lower average volume is mainly due to the selling of million of investment securities in the last half of to fund the stock tender offer and investment securities maturing in from which proceeds were not reinvested in new investment securities  and a  increase in interest expense primarily related to higher rates on deposits and debt 
an increase of basis points were paid on million of average time deposits and basis points increase were paid on million of average debt 
partly offsetting the lower interest income on investment securities and higher interest expense was increased interest income from loans in compared with the majority of the increase in loan interest income for the year resulted from a combination of volume and yield components 
average loan volumes increased million  or  and the yield increased basis points to  resulting in an increase in interest income of  net interest income for decreased  or  compared with the largest factor contributing to the decline in net interest income was the million  or  increase in interest expense in compared with which resulted primarily from a basis point increase in the average rate paid on money market deposit accounts  a basis point increase on the average rate paid on savings deposits and a basis point increase in the average rate paid on time deposits caused by rising rates generally and competitive pressure in our markets  and an increase in average money market deposit accounts of million  or  resulting from the impact of the migration from non interest bearing accounts and time deposits in a rising rate environment and the addition of a cash management program for our business customers 
in addition  average noninterest bearing deposits increased  or 
offsetting in part the increased interest expense was increased interest income from earning assets of million or  in compared with the majority of the million increase in interest income for the year resulted from a combination of volume and yield components 
average loan volumes increased million  or  and the yield increased basis points to  resulting in an increase in interest income of million 
average investment volumes decreased million  or  primarily due to the sale of securities to fund the tender offer 
net interest margin net interest margin  which is the net return on earning assets  is a key performance ratio for evaluating net interest income 
it is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
net interest margin was for  a basis point decrease from in the net interest margin in was down basis points compared with the net interest margin of in our net interest margin declines in each year were primarily due to higher funding costs and the shifting from long term debt to short term debt with higher rates

also  there was a net loss of  in sales of foreclosed property primarily related to the sale of one large commercial property 
other year over year decreases in revenue included trust services and insurance services 
the declines in revenue were partially offset by a  gain on the sale of the retail credit card portfolio in in addition  retail brokerage services income had growth of  or  and income from service charges on deposit accounts grew  or  when compared with the prior year 
additionally  noninterest income in was negatively impacted by a nonrecurring  loss on the sale of securities to fund the corporation s stock tender offer in that year 
noninterest income in decreased  compared with the decline was primarily the result of a decrease of  in mortgage banking income  the single largest component of the corporation s noninterest income  due to numerous payoffs of serviced loans at empire 
the mortgage banking servicing portfolio at empire is comprised of non recourse loans which we service for participating commercial mortgage lenders  and at december   was approximately million  an decrease from the balance at december  this decline was primarily due to numerous payoffs of serviced loans 
also  noninterest income was negatively impacted in by the loss on the sale of securities to fund the tender offer and a decrease in fees from trust services 
offsetting  in part  the declines in noninterest income  deposit service charge income in increased  or  over related primarily to increased fees from our new cash management program for our business customers and increased fees related to our overdraft protection program 
other increases resulted from growth in fees related to insurance services and an increase in fees related to retail brokerage services

total noninterest expense increased  or  in compared with the majority of this increase was related to the million loss sustained during the fourth quarter by the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary realized as a result of covering the shortfall of participant banks related to the sale of foreclosed commercial property 
this increase is partially offset by decreases in salary and employee benefits  amortization of intangible assets  and other operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits decreased as a result of a lower amount required to fund the pension plan in of  compared with million in also  was the last year of contributions to the deferred compensation plan  resulting in a  expense reduction in another factor in the decrease in salaries and employee benefits was the decrease in officer performance compensation primarily related to the mortgage banking subsidiary s lower profitability in compared with in the officer performance compensation was  compared with  in amortization of intangible assets decreased  to  in this reduction resulted from returning to a normal level after accelerating the amortization of our mortgage servicing assets due to the large payoffs of serviced loans in other operating expenses declined  compared with due to professional services related to the tender offer and to pension consulting expenses in total noninterest expense increased  or  in compared with the majority of this increase of  was from the increased amortization of intangible assets described above 
also  a increase occurred in other operating expenses due to higher professional service fees related to the tender offer and to pension consulting 
occupancy expense increased due to normal inflationary adjustments 
these increases in noninterest expenses were partially offset by a decrease in data processing fees due to the expiration of a contract related to our overdraft protection program 
equipment expenses were down in due to normal adjustments to operations 
salaries and employee benefits decreased slightly due to a reduction in the number of full time employees from to  partially offset by an additional pension contribution of  the additional pension funding was a one time charge incurred in connection with freezing the pension plan and was necessary for the required minimum contribution 
the efficiency ratio noninterest expense divided by total noninterest income plus net interest income  a measure of productivity  increased to for  from for and for the higher efficiency ratio was primarily due to the loss related to mortgage banking services and to lower revenues 
federal income tax expense the corporation expensed   and million for federal income taxes for the years ending december    and  respectively 
these amounts resulted in an effective tax rate of   and  for   and  respectively

uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
during  total average assets decreased million  or  to million 
the corporation s earning assets  which include loans  investment securities  deposits at the federal home loan bank  and federal funds sold averaged million in  a decrease over million in this decrease was primarily the result of decreased average volume in investment securities and federal funds sold  which was offset by improved average loan volume 
the earning asset mix shifted towards higher average loans 
for  average earning assets were comprised of loans  investment securities  and federal funds sold and funds at the federal home loan bank 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets decreased slightly to for compared with for loans loans are one of the corporation s largest earning assets and uses of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio

even though  year over year loan balances are down due to recent payoffs  average total loans increased million in due to an increase in local loan demand mainly in construction and commercial loans 
the ratio of total loans to total deposits at year end slightly decreased to in compared with in the loan portfolio mix at year end consisted of loans secured by construction real estate  loans secured by commercial real estate  of loans secured by residential real estate  and of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
the loan portfolio also included other commercial  financial  and agricultural purposes of and installment loans to individuals for consumer purposes of 
allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have a loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other potentially impaired loans that have been identified as possible problems 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented an  decrease from the corresponding year end amount which was of total loans outstanding 
there was no provision for loan losses in and in  we had an  provision for loan losses 
our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb possible losses in the loan portfolio resulted in not having to provide for losses during the year 
see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the changes in the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities consist primarily of us government agency securities 
the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in securities are used as a source of income to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability  and is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements 
our investment policy attempts to provide adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with staggered maturities ranging from one to five years

the total investment portfolio decreased to million from million at year end compared with year end  a decrease of million  or 
the majority of this decrease was due to the maturing of million of us government agency securities and the calling  by the issuer  of million of us government agency securities 
the average total investment portfolio decreased to million in compared with million for we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing  renegotiated loans  potential problem loans and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets increased  at year end compared with year end this increase primarily resulted from large single loans held in nonaccrual loans at year end 
at the end of  we had one large million fully secured loan in nonaccrual loans on which no loss is anticipated 
in  we had a single million nonaccrual loan which foreclosed and the collateral property was sold for a loss of  during the fourth quarter of nonperforming assets were approximately million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits decreased compared with  from million to million 
the majority of the decrease in average deposits occurred in average money market deposit accounts and now account deposits 
competitive interest rates during resulted in change in the deposit mix 
the majority of the decreases in money market accounts were attributable to distributing money market funds held in a large estate account administered by our trust department 
our strong level of money market accounts are related to commercial customers using our cash management program which provided money market rates of return for large cash balances 
during the latter part of the fourth quarter of  many of our now accounts with low transaction volume were reclassified to money market accounts 
as of december   the corporation had a total of million in certificates of deposit of  or more each 
this was a increase over the million total in we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation borrowed million as advances from the federal home loan bank and repaid million of short term advances  and million of advances will be paid in total long term advances with the federal home loan bank were million at december  details on the federal home bank advances are presented in note to the financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is managed to assume that the corporation can meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing funds to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from deposits  interest and fee income  loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
the consolidated statement of cash flows details the corporation s cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  operating and investing activities generated cash flows of million  while financing activities used million resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents balances of million 
net cash provided by operations continues to provide cash for the payment of dividends and common stock repurchases 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation s deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less public funds and time deposits of  or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits were of total deposits on december   compared with in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity  such as cash which is received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments which can be easily converted to cash without significant loss 
the corporation s investment securities maturing within one year or less were million on december   which represented of the investment debt securities portfolio 
also  the corporation has million of investment securities callable at the option of the issuer and many are likely to be called during if interest rates drop more than 
these maturing and callable investment securities are sources for repayment of our short term and long term debt obligations 
due to the recent drop in the short term rate by the federal reserve  we expect the majority of our callable securities to be called in if these investment securities are called by the issuers  we anticipate that we can improve our net interest income and profitability by repositioning our callable securities balance 
we expect to reinvest these proceeds from called investment securities in new loans  new investment securities  and to repay debt 
we are not aware of any known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and its scheduled future cash payments under those commitments as of december  the majority of the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations were long term debt 
the remaining contractual obligations were comprised of telephone operating leases and purchase obligations for data processing services

off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which arise in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

capital resources and dividends our average equity to average assets ratio was in and in the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued rules regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an total risk based ratio  of which must consist primarily of tangible common shareholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a leverage ratio 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
to continue to conduct its business as currently conducted  the corporation and the bank will need to maintain capital well above the minimum levels

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s primary market risk is exposure to interest rate movements 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by the bank 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio that staggers maturities and provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity 
the table below provides information about the corporation s financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for each rate sensitive asset and liability listed  the table presents principal balances and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity or the earliest possible repricing opportunity dates 
one of the indicators for our interest rate sensitivity position is the measurement of the difference between its rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which is referred to as the gap 
a gap analysis displays the earliest possible repricing opportunity for each asset and liability category based upon contractual maturities and repricing 
at year end  our sensitivity ratio  or one year cumulative rate sensitive assets relative to cumulative rate sensitive liabilities  was compared with for this change in the sensitivity ratio was a result of the corporation s management of its exposure to interest rate risk 
we are more asset sensitive at the one year gap position compared with being liability sensitive in the previous year 
these changes in assets and liabilities occurred in increase in investment securities that will mature of have the potential of being called within one year  increase in short term investments  and decrease in money market deposit type of accounts 
this asset sensitive position will increase the corporation s exposure to falling interest rates 
all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same pace  therefore  the sensitivity ratio is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
we monitor our asset and liability mix in an effort to ensure that the effects of interest rate movements in either direction are not significant over time
