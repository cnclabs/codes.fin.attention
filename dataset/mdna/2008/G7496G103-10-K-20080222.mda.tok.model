item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in our financial statements and supplementary data presented under item reinsurance segment our reinsurance operations are comprised of three units property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and certain other activities of ventures as described herein 
our reinsurance operations are managed by the president of renaissance reinsurance  who leads a team of underwriters  risk modelers and other industry professionals  who have access to our proprietary risk management  underwriting and modeling resources and tools 
we believe the expertise of our underwriting and modeling team and our proprietary analytic tools  together with superior customer service  provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
our portfolio of business has continued to be increasingly characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business  although no current relationship exceeds of our gross premiums written 
accordingly  our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these large customers 
we believe that recent market dynamics  and trends in our industry in respect of potential future consolidation  have increased our exposure to the risks of client and counterparty concentration 
the following table shows our total managed catastrophe and specialty reinsurance gross premiums written year ended december  in thousands renaissance catastrophe premiums renaissance specialty premiums total renaissance premiums davinci catastrophe premiums davinci specialty premiums total davinci premiums total reinsurance premiums total specialty premiums total catastrophe premiums catastrophe premiums written on behalf of our joint venture  top layer re catastrophe premiums assumed from our individual risk segment total managed catastrophe premiums managed catastrophe premiums assumed on behalf of fully collateralized joint ventures total managed catastrophe premiums  net of fully collateralized joint ventures total specialty premiums written includes million  million and million of premiums assumed from our individual risk segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
top layer re is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 

table of contents in addition to the gaap financial measures set forth in this form k  we have included certain non gaap financial measures in this form k within the meaning of regulation g 
we have consistently provided these financial measurements in previous filings and we believe that these measurements are important to investors and other interested parties  and that investors and other such persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry 
these measures may not  however  be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside the insurance industry 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non gaap measures in assessing our overall financial performance 
we have included in this form k managed catastrophe premiums and managed catastrophe premiums  net of fully collateralized joint ventures 
managed catastrophe premiums is defined as gross catastrophe premiums written by renaissance reinsurance and its related joint ventures  excluding catastrophe premiums assumed from the company s individual risk segment 
managed catastrophe premiums differ from total catastrophe premiums  which the company believes is the most directly comparable gaap measure  due to the inclusion of catastrophe premiums written on behalf of the company s joint venture top layer re  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the exclusion of catastrophe premiums assumed from the company s individual risk segment 
managed catastrophe premiums  net of fully collateralized joint ventures differ from total catastrophe premiums  which the company believes is the most directly comparable gaap measure  due to the inclusion of catastrophe premiums written on behalf of the company s joint venture top layer re  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting  the exclusion of catastrophe premiums assumed from the company s individual risk segment  and the deduction of catastrophe premiums that are written by the company and ceded directly to the company s fully collateralized joint ventures which include  as applicable  starbound re  starbound ii and tim re 
the company s management believes managed catastrophe premiums is useful to investors and other interested parties because it provides a measure of total catastrophe reinsurance premiums assumed by the company through its consolidated subsidiaries and related joint ventures 
the company believes managed catastrophe premiums  net of fully collateralized joint ventures is also a useful measure to investors and other interested parties because it provides a measure of total catastrophe reinsurance premiums assumed by the company through its consolidated subsidiaries and related joint ventures  net of catastrophe premiums assumed from the company s individual risk segment and net of catastrophe premiums written directly on behalf of the company s fully collateralized joint ventures 
property catastrophe reinsurance we believe we are one of the largest providers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the world  based on our total managed catastrophe premium 
our principal property catastrophe reinsurance products include catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance and excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance as described below catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
we principally write catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis  which means we provide coverage to our insureds when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in a particular contract 
under these contracts we indemnify an insurer for a portion of the losses on insurance policies in excess of a specified loss amount  and up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
the coverage provided under excess of loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance 
we also write retrocessional reinsurance contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
in providing retrocessional reinsurance  we focus on property catastrophe retrocessional reinsurance which covers the retrocedant on an excess of loss basis when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril and from a multiple number of reinsureds exceed a specified attachment point 
the coverage provided under excess of loss retrocessional contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
the information available to retrocessional underwriters concerning 
table of contents the original primary risk can be less precise than the information received from primary companies directly 
moreover  exposures from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant alter their book of business after retrocessional coverage has been bound 
our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally all risk in nature 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism in connection with the coverages we provide 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
we offer our coverages on a worldwide basis 
because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed  including the size of such events and because of the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period  our catastrophe reinsurance business is volatile and our results of operations reflect this volatility 
further  our financial condition may be impacted by this volatility over time or at any point in time 
the effects of claims from one or a number of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
catastrophe linked securities 
we also invest in catastrophe linked securities cat linked securities 
cat linked securities are generally privately placed fixed income securities as to which all or a portion of the repayment of the principal is linked to catastrophic events  for example  the occurrence of one or more hurricanes or earthquakes producing industry losses exceeding certain specified thresholds 
we underwrite  model  evaluate and monitor these securities using the same tools and techniques used to evaluate our more traditional property catastrophe reinsurance business assumed 
in addition  we may enter into derivative transactions  such as total return swaps  that are based on or referenced to underlying cat linked securities 
based on an evaluation of the specific features of each cat linked security  we account for these securities as reinsurance  investments or derivatives  as applicable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  in future periods we may utilize the growing market for cat linked securities to expand our ceded reinsurance buying if we find the pricing and terms of such coverage attractive 
we seek to moderate the volatility of our risk portfolio through superior risk selection  diversification and the purchase of retrocessional coverages and other protections 
in furtherance of our strategy  we may opportunistically increase or decrease our presence in the catastrophe reinsurance business based on market conditions and our assessment of risk adjusted pricing adequacy 
we frequently seek to purchase reinsurance or other protection for our own account to further reduce the financial impact that a large catastrophe or a series of catastrophes could have on our results 
as a result of our position in the market and reputation for superior customer service  we believe we have superior access to business we view as desirable compared to the market as a whole 
as described above  we use our proprietary underwriting tools and guidelines to attempt to construct an attractive portfolio from these opportunities 
we dynamically model policy submissions against our current in force underwriting portfolio  comparing our estimate of the modeled expected returns of the contract against the amount of capital that we allocate to the contract  based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our overall risk portfolio 
at times  our approach to portfolio management has resulted and may result in the future in our having a relatively large market share of catastrophe reinsurance exposure in a particular geographic region or to a particular peril  where we believe pricing is attractive 
conversely  from time to time we may have a disproportionately low market share in regions or perils where we believe pricing is inadequate 
specialty reinsurance we write a number of lines of reinsurance other than property catastrophe  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice  casualty clash  certain other casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
as with our catastrophe business  our team of experienced professionals seeks to underwrite these lines using a disciplined underwriting approach and sophisticated analytical tools 

table of contents we believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage this business 
we generally target lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and where potential losses could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  similar to our catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
we also seek to identify market dislocations and will opportunistically write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates 
we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio  including our aggregate exposure to single and aggregated catastrophe events 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our catastrophe reinsurance products  and also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance and pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
the reinsurer pays the cedant a commission which is generally based on the cedant s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured including commissions  premium taxes  assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses and may also include a profit factor 
our products generally include tailored features such as limits or sub limits which we believe help us manage our exposures 
any liability exceeding  or otherwise not subject to  such limits reverts to the cedant 
as with our catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance frequently provides coverage for relatively large limits or exposures  and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility 
we generally seek to write significant lines on our specialty reinsurance treaties 
as a result of our financial strength  we have the ability to offer significant capacity and  for select risks  we have made available limits of up to approximately million per excess of loss program 
we believe these capabilities  the strength of our specialty reinsurance underwriting team  and our demonstrated ability and willingness to pay valid claims are competitive advantages of our specialty reinsurance business 
ventures we pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit  which has responsibility for managing our joint venture relationships  executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance 
property catastrophe managed joint ventures 
we actively manage property catastrophe oriented joint ventures  which provide us with an additional presence in the market  enhance client relationships and generate fee income 
such ventures allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base 
during  following the formation of starbound re in  we participated in a new joint venture  starbound ii 
this new joint venture provided capacity to the us property catastrophe market  primarily for the us hurricane season 
currently  our joint ventures include top layer re  davinci and starbound ii 
we are the exclusive underwriting manager for each of these joint ventures 
davinci continuously analyzes attractive opportunities to write reinsurance globally 
in general  we seek to construct for davinci a property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of renaissance reinsurance s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we also write certain lines of specialty reinsurance for davinci 
currently  these lines include terrorism and catastrophe exposed workers compensation 
we maintain majority voting control of davincire and  accordingly  consolidate the results of davincire into our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we seek to manage davinci s capital efficiently over time in light of the market opportunities and needs we perceive and believe we are able to serve 
our ownership in davincire was at december  and  respectively 
we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate to a degree over time 
top layer re writes high excess non us property catastrophe reinsurance 
top layer re is owned by state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm and by renaissance reinsurance 
state farm provides billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to top layer re 
we account for our equity ownership in top layer re under the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of its results are reflected in equity in losses earnings of other ventures in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents starbound ii was formed in may to provide excess of loss property catastrophe reinsurance capacity  primarily for the us hurricane season 
on may   the company initially invested million in starbound ii  which represented a equity ownership interest in starbound ii 
effective december   the company invested an additional million in starbound ii  increasing its equity ownership interest to

starbound ii was capitalized on may  with million of equity capital and million of debt 
the company wrote additional property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts incepting on june  and then ceded up to of these contracts to starbound ii in accordance with two fully collateralized quota share agreements in return for an underwriting profit commission and an expense override 
rum manages the administration of starbound ii for an annual fee 
we account for our equity ownership in starbound ii under the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of its results are reflected in equity in losses earnings of other ventures in our consolidated statements of operations 
starbound reinsurance ltd 
starbound re was formed in may to provide excess of loss property catastrophe reinsurance capacity  primarily for the us hurricane season 
during  renaissance reinsurance and davinci ceded a defined portfolio of property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts incepting between june  and july  to starbound re in accordance with a fully collateralized quota share agreement in return for an underwriting profit commission and an expense override 
we accounted for our investment in starbound holdings ltd 
starbound  which is a holding company and is the parent company to starbound re  under the equity method of accounting from inception through august  effective august   starbound repurchased the outstanding shares of all other investors at book value per obligations under the shareholders agreement 
as a result  the company now owns of starbound and therefore consolidates the operating results of starbound 
in may  the company sold third party capital in tim re to provide additional capacity to accept property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance business for the hurricane season  in return for a profit commission 
in january  the company purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of tim re 
the company accounts for tim re as a consolidated subsidiary 
ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance transactions 
for example  we have participated  and continuously analyze other attractive opportunities to participate  in the market for cat linked securities 
we also offer products through which we cede participations in the performance of our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners  as well as our risk management objectives 
strategic investments 
ventures also pursues other types of strategic investments where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we instead partner with other market participants 
these investments are directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe  and at times may also be directed at non insurance risks 
we find these investments attractive both for their expected returns  and also because they provide us diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market 
examples of these investments include channelre holdings ltd 
channelre a bermuda based financial guaranty reinsurer 
we are a founding investor in channelre and contributed million  or  as part of the initial capitalization of channelre on february  channelre assumed an approximate billion par amount portfolio of in force business from mbia inc and certain of its affiliates mbia  and participates in its reinsurance treaty and provides facultative reinsurance support 
channelre s current portfolio of in force business is estimated to be billion par amount  of which billion relates to municipal business and billion relates to structured finance business 
as a result of channelre s estimate of its third and fourth quarter unrealized mark to market losses arising from financial quaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap  channelre has informed the company that these mark to market charges have contributed to a loss exceeding channelre s gaap shareholders equity 
as such  the company has reduced the carried value of its equity investment in channelre to nil as of december

platinum a bermuda based diversified reinsurance company 
in  we invested million in exchange for million common shares of platinum  in connection therewith  we obtained a warrant to purchase an additional million common shares of platinum at a strike price of  and entered into a variety of commercial relationships with platinum 
we sold our common shares in platinum in december we are currently involved with and expect to continue to be involved with platinum on a variety of commercial relationships 
we also continue to own the warrant 
aladdin credit products ltd 
aladdin a manager of investment grade and high yield corporate credits 
aladdin is a derivatives product company rated aaa by fitch 
during the fourth quarter of  we invested million in the preferred equity of aladdin  representing a ownership interest 
through its subsidiary  aladdin financial products llc afp  aladdin intends to assume single name  investment grade corporate and sovereign credit exposure which aladdin believes will produce attractive risk adjusted returns 
weather related activities 
we undertake weather related consulting and trading activities through our operating companies including  weather predict  wp consulting  accurate environmental forecasting inc aef  rim and rtl 
weather predict  wp consulting and aef provide fee based consulting services  sell weather related information and forecasts  and engage in education  research and development  and loss mitigation activities  such as the renaissancere wall of wind facility in southern florida 
rtl sells certain financial products primarily to address weather risks  and engages in certain derivatives trading activities 
principally  through rtl  we expect that our participation in the trading markets for securities and derivatives linked to weather  other natural phenomena  or products or indices linked in part to such phenomena will increase 
as this unit grows  we are seeking to develop client and customer relationships  build operating and control environment systems and procedures  hire staff and develop and install management information and other systems 
we are also taking numerous other steps to implement our strategies 
to a degree  success in executing our strategies in respect of this unit requires us to develop new expertise in certain areas 
if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  or otherwise fail to execute our strategy  our results from these new lines of business will likely suffer  perhaps materially 
business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  the results of our investments  such as top layer re  channelre  starbound ii  aladdin  platinum  our weather related activities and other ventures are included in the other category of our segment results 
competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and we believe that competition is increasing and becoming more robust 
with respect to our reinsurance operations  we believe that our principal competitors include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace limited ace  allied world assurance company ltd 
allied world  arch capital group arch  axis capital holdings axis  endurance specialty holdings ltd 
endurance  everest re group ltd 
everest re  ipc holdings  ltd

validus  white mountains insurance group ltd 
white mountains and xl capital ltd 
xl we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as american international group  inc aig  berkshire hathaway berkshire  munich re group and swiss re 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
following hurricane katrina in august  a significant trend of new company formation focused in bermuda commenced  which resulted in substantial new competition for and subsequent periods 
increased competition could cause  both on an industry wide basis and for our book of business  a decrease in premium rates  less favorable policy terms  and a decrease in the percentage or absolute amount of attractive business we are able to write  the occurrence of any of which could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
hedge funds  investment banks  exchanges and other capital market participants have also shown increasing interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance 
table of contents companies  or through the use of other financial products 
we believe that competition from non traditional sources such as these will continue to increase 
for example  over the last several years there has been substantial growth in financial products such as exchange traded catastrophe options  cat linked securities  catastrophe linked derivative agreements and other financial products  intended to compete with traditional reinsurance 
many of these new competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
in addition  the tax policies of the countries where our clients operate as well as government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for reinsurance 
we are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing new  proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the risks which may be available for us when considering to offer coverage 
individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our individual risk segment is managed by the chief executive officer of the glencoe group 
our individual risk operations seek  on an opportunistic basis  to identify and write classes of business which are attractively priced relative to the risk exposure and  particularly in the case of catastrophe exposed risks  where our expertise in modeling  analytical tools and information systems may provide a competitive advantage

stonington  a texas domiciled insurance company  is licensed on an admitted basis in all states and the district of columbia 
lantana is a bermuda domiciled insurance company currently eligible as an excess and surplus lines carrier in us jurisdictions 
our principal contracts include insurance contracts and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and multi peril crop insurance  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 

table of contents our individual risk business is produced primarily through three distribution channels program managers we write specialty lines primary insurance through specialized program managers  who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide related back office functions  quota share reinsurance we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers who  similar to our program managers  provide most of the back office functions 
business is written pursuant to agreed upon guidelines  and broker produced business we write primary insurance produced through brokers on a risk by risk basis  underwriting and back office functions for this business are based in our offices in bermuda while claims handling is outsourced

we rely on these third parties for services including policy issuance  premium collection  claims processing  and compliance with various state laws and regulations including licensing 
we seek to work closely with these partners  attempting to employ our analytical methodologies and  where appropriate  our expertise in catastrophe risk  to arrive at adequate pricing for the risks being underwritten 
we seek to structure these relationships to provide value to both parties and meaningful protections to us 
our strategy is to pursue a relatively small number of relatively large relationships 
we actively oversee our third party relationships through an operations review team at glencoe specialty services and through the use of proprietary tools such as pacer 
our operations review team includes professionals from diverse disciplines including actuarial science  accounting  claims management  law  regulatory compliance and underwriting 
this group assists with the initial due diligence as well as the ongoing monitoring of these third parties 
our ongoing monitoring includes periodic audits of our program managers and third party administrators 
in addition  for our large program managers we maintain an employee in an underwriting capacity on site at the program manager to oversee the program manager s compliance with our prescribed underwriting guidelines 
we generally seek to have contractual performance standards for each of our programs and third party claims administrators whose compensation is subject to adjustment based on meeting these standards 
the program operations team audits compliance with our underwriting guidelines and contractually agreed operating guidelines and performance standards 
the program operations team also seeks to ensure corrective action is taken quickly to resolve issues identified during the audit process 
competition in our individual risk business  we face competition from independent insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of major worldwide companies and others  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
primary insurers compete on the basis of various factors including distribution 
table of contents channels  product  price  service  financial strength and reputation 
many of our reinsurance segment competitors listed above also compete for the program business and quota share reinsurance we write within our individual risk segment 
we believe that our principal competitors in the program business of our individual risk segment include operating subsidiaries of aig  arch  wr berkley corp 
berkley  berkshire  hannover re and zurich financial services group zurich 
in our individual risk business  we compete not only in respect of the insurance and reinsurance products we offer  but in respect of the contractual relationships with the program managers with whom we seek to partner 
increased competition in respect of our products could result in decreased premium rates  less attractive terms and conditions  and a decrease in our share of attractive programs 
increased competition in respect of our program manager partners  as to whom we are extremely selective and whose relationship we seek to tightly manage in a disciplined  consistent fashion  could result in less favorable terms and conditions in respect of our contractual arrangements with our partners  the loss of existing program manager relationships  or constrain our ability to add new relationships to our operations 
in addition  there has been a growing trend of insurance and reinsurance companies acquiring program managers 
acquisitions of program managers with whom we do business by other insurance or reinsurance companies could result in us losing that program manager relationship 
any of the foregoing could adversely impact the growth and profitability of our individual risk segment 
ratings financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in respect of the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies 
rating organizations continually review the financial positions of reinsurers and insurers  including renaissance reinsurance  top layer re  davinci and the glencoe group 
over the last five years  we have received high claims paying and financial strength ratings from am best co 
am best  standard poor s rating agency s p  moody s and fitch 
these ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations  and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any of our securities 
presented below are the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures by segment and the senior debt ratings of renaissancere as of february  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources credit ratings for information about recent ratings actions

the am best  s p  moody s and fitch ratings for renaissancere represent the credit ratings on its senior unsecured debt 
am best 
a is the second highest designation of am best s sixteen rating levels 
a rated insurance companies are defined as superior companies and are considered by am best to have a very strong 
table of contents ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
a and a are the third and fourth highest designations  respectively  assigned by am best  representing am best s opinion that the insurer has an excellent ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders 
am best also assigns a financial size category to each of the insurance companies rated 
vii represents a company with million in capital  x represents a company with million in capital  xii represents a company with million in capital  xiii represents a company with billion in capital and xiv represents a company with billion in capital 
the outlooks for renaissance reinsurance and renaissance europe are positive 
the ratings outlook for davinci and renaissancere s debt are stable and the outlook for glencoe is positive 
s p 
the aa range aa  aa  aa  which has been assigned by s p to renaissance reinsurance and top layer re  is the second highest rating assigned by s p  and indicates that s p believes the insurer s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the a range a  a and a is the third highest of four ratings ranges within what s p considers the secure category 
an insurer rated a is believed by s p to have strong financial security characteristics  but to be somewhat more likely to be affected by business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
moody s 
moody s insurance financial strength ratings and moody s credit ratings represent its opinions of the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually policyholder claims and obligations and senior unsecured debt instruments 
moody s believes that insurance companies rated a  such as renaissance reinsurance  and companies rated baa  such as renaissancere  offer good financial security 
however  moody s believes that elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future 
fitch 
fitch ratings ltd 
issuer financial strength ratings provide an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization 
fitch believes that insurance companies rated a  such as renaissance reinsurance  have strong capacity to meet policyholders and contract obligations on a timely basis with a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments 
fitch also provides long term credit ratings  used as a benchmark measure of probability of default  these were formerly described as issuer default ratings 
renaissancere has been rated bbb  meaning there are currently expectations of low credit risk 
while the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures within our reinsurance segment remain among the highest in our business  adverse ratings actions could have a negative effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
in addition  it is common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on the financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
our ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them 
underwriting and enterprise risk management underwriting our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on shareholders equity  subject to prudent risk constraints  and to generate long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus accumulated dividends 
we assess each new contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk 

table of contents reinsurance we have developed a proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  rems 
since inception  we have continued to invest in and improve rems  incorporating our underwriting experience  additional proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data 
rems has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
we combine the analyses generated by rems with other information available to us  including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program  to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss which the program presents 
we have licensed and integrated into rems a number of third party catastrophe computer models in addition to our base model  which we use to validate and stress test our base rems results 
rems is most developed in analyzing catastrophe risks 
we believe that our tools for assessing non catastrophe risks are much less sophisticated and much less well developed than those for catastrophe risks 
we continue to improve our analytical techniques relating to non catastrophe risks 
we believe that rems is a more robust underwriting and risk management system than is currently commercially available elsewhere in the reinsurance industry 
before we bind a reinsurance risk  exposure data is typically gathered from clients and this exposure data is input into the rems modeling system 
we believe that the rems modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis  assisting our determination of what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk that is assumed 
rems combines computer generated statistical simulations that estimate event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client s reinsurance contract to produce expected claims for reinsurance programs submitted to us 
our models employ simulation techniques to generate  years of loss activity  including events causing in excess of billion in insured losses 
from this simulation  we generate a probability distribution of potential outcomes for each program in our portfolio and for our total portfolio 
in part through the utilization of rems we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital that we notionally allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks 
we have also customized rems by including additional perils  risks and geographic areas that are not captured in the commercially available models 
we periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in rems and our other tools 
for example  in the second half of we revised our assumptions relating to atlantic basin hurricane frequency and severity 
while many commercial catastrophe models base their frequency and severity distributions on the last years of hurricane activity  assuming that this time frame is an appropriate framework on which to base estimates of the hurricane risk to which the insurance industry is exposed  we currently do not believe  based on our review of the scientific literature  private research  and discussions with climatologists and meteorologists  that the past years of data is reflective of current climatological risks 
in particular  we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that have the potential to make landfall in the us  potentially as a result of decadal ocean water temperature cyclical trends  a longer term trend towards global warming  or both or other factors 
we started using these revised assumptions in rems to model and evaluate our portfolio of risk in the latter part of the process of updating all of the underlying risk models is continuous  and many of the assumptions involve significant judgment on our part  and further experience or scientific research may lead us to further adjust these assumptions 
changes in our modeled assumptions may impact from time to time the amount of capacity we are prepared to offer 
our catastrophe reinsurance underwriters use rems in their pricing decisions  which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages 
these include the ability to simulate a greater number of years of catastrophic event activity compared to a much smaller sample in generally available models  allowing us to analyze exposure to a greater number and combination of potential events  to analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio  to better assess the underlying exposures associated with assumed retrocessional business  to price contracts within a short time frame  
table of contents to capture various classes of risk  including catastrophe and other insurance risks  to assess risk across multiple entities including our various joint ventures and across different components of our capital structure  and to provide consistent pricing information 
as part of our risk management process  we also use rems to assist us with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account 
we have developed underwriting guidelines  to be used in conjunction with rems  that seek to limit the exposure to claims from any single catastrophic event and the exposure to losses from a series of catastrophic events 
as part of our pricing and underwriting process  we also assess a variety of other factors  including the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long term relationship with the cedant  the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share  historical loss data for the cedant and  where available  for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions  in order to compare the cedant s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages  the cedant s pricing strategies  and the perceived financial strength of the cedant 
in order to estimate the risk profile of each line of specialty reinsurance  we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio 
in lines with catastrophe risk  such as excess workers compensation  we are leveraging directly off our skill in modeling for our property catastrophe reinsurance risks  and seek to appropriately estimate and manage the correlations between these specialty lines and our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
for other classes of business  which we believe we have little or no natural catastrophe exposure  and hence estimate we will have significantly less correlation with our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  we derive probability distributions from a variety of underlying information  including recent historical experience  but with the application of judgment as appropriate 
the nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis that we use for our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  reflecting both the nature of available exposure information  and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure 
we produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related underlying risks which our products cover  which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio 
overall  we undertake to construct conservative representations of the risks within our models  although there can be no assurance that this has occurred 
individual risk for our catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we utilize proprietary modeling tools that have been developed in conjunction with the modeling and other resources utilized in our reinsurance operations  as described above 
we also combine these analyses with those of our reinsurance segment to monitor our aggregate group catastrophic exposures 
in general  we believe our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk are better developed than those for other classes of risk 
for the business produced through program managers  we seek to carefully identify and evaluate potential program managers 
when evaluating a potential new program manager  we consider numerous factors including i whether the program manager can provide and help us analyze historic loss and other business data  ii whether the program manager will agree to accept a portion of their compensation based on the underwriting performance of their program and provide us with the other terms and conditions we require  iii our assessment of the integrity and experience of the program manager s management team  iv the potential profitability of the program to us  and v the availability of our internal resources to appropriately conduct due diligence  negotiate and execute transaction terms  and provide the ongoing 
table of contents monitoring we require 
in considering pricing for the products to be offered by the program manager  we evaluate the expected frequency and severity of losses  the costs of providing the necessary coverage including the cost of administering policy benefits  sales and other administrative and overhead costs  the necessity of third party reinsurance  the estimated costs thereof and an anticipated margin for profit 
in addition to utilizing rems  within our individual risk operations we have developed pacer  within which we intend to maintain all of our program business 
we are developing statistical and analytical techniques to help evaluate the lines of business we write within this segment and which over time we hope will create a competitive advantage 
we believe that pacer helps our clients better understand their business  thus creating value for them and us 
for example  we believe that pacer enables us to better identify and estimate the expected loss experience of particular products and pacer is employed in the design of our products and the establishment of rates 
we also seek to monitor pricing adequacy on our products by region  risk and producer 
subject to regulatory considerations  we seek to make timely premium and coverage modifications where we determine them to be appropriate 
we provide our program managers with written underwriting guidelines and monitor their compliance with our guidelines on a regular basis 
also  our contracts generally provide that a portion of the commission payable to our program managers will be on a retrospective basis  which is intended to permit us to adjust commissions based on our profitability and claims experience once an underwriting year is reasonably mature 
we rely on our program managers to perform underwriting pursuant to these contractual guidelines  and believe we benefit from their superior local information and expertise in niche areas 
enterprise risk management we have sought to develop and utilize a series of tools and processes that support a robust system of enterprise risk management erm within our organization 
we consider erm to be a key process  overseen by our senior management team under the supervision of our board of directors  and implemented by personnel from across our organization 
we believe that erm helps us to identify potential events that may affect us  to quantify  evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed  and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives 
we believe that effective erm can provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
we also believe that effective erm assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments  underwriting decisions  or other operating or business activities 
we believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities created by dislocated markets and help us to identify opportunities that we believe to be the most attractive 
our risk management tools allow us to monitor our capital position  on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries  and these tools help us determine the appropriate amount of capital to support the risks that we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries 
we believe that our risk management efforts are essential to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long term growth in tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends for our shareholders 
our erm framework comprises four key activities  as set forth below underwriting and other quantifiable risks 
we believe that our operations are subject to a number of key risks  including underwriting risk  credit risk and interest rate risk as they relate to investments  ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment risk  which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques 
of these  we believe underwriting risk to be the most material to us 
in order to understand  monitor  quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk  we seek to develop and deploy appropriate tools to  among other things  estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities  and estimate the impact that such incremental business could have on our overall risk profile 
we use the tools and methods described above in underwriting to seek to achieve these objectives 
aggregate risk profile 
in part through the utilization of rems and our other systems and procedures  we seek to analyze our in force aggregate underwriting portfolio on a daily basis 
we believe this capability  not only helps us to manage our aggregate exposures  but assists our efforts to rigorously analyze individual 
table of contents proposed transactions and evaluate them in the context of our in force portfolio 
this aggregation process captures line of business  segment and corporate risk profiles  calculates internal and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance 
generally  additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk  credit risk  capital adequacy and liquidity 
this information is used in day to day decision making for underwriting  investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and in respect of our consolidated financial position 
operational risk 
we believe we are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational  regulatory  and other matters  which we also seek to actively monitor and manage 
this effort is coordinated by senior personnel including our chief financial officer cfo  general counsel and chief compliance officer cco  corporate controller and chief accounting officer cao  chief administrative officer and internal audit  utilizing resources within the company 
in an effort to identify and reduce operational and regulatory risk  in recent years we have significantly enhanced our control environment and have added additional finance  legal and back office resources  to keep pace with the rate of growth experienced by the company 
for example we have developed and expanded the compliance and internal audit functions  the accounting function has been strengthened by the addition of a significant number of professionals  the accounting  legal and compliance resources have been placed in our business units to monitor  identify and resolve potential accounting and compliance needs at the operational level  and we have documented accounting guidelines for the review of all non standard reinsurance contracts and other structured and or complex financial transactions 
although financial reporting is a key area of our focus  other operational risks are addressed through our disaster recovery program  compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent  and adherence to strict compliance  legal and tax protocols 
controls and compliance committee 
as part of monitoring our risks  we have instituted a controls and compliance committee 
the controls and compliance committee is comprised of our cfo  cco  cao  chief administrative officer  staff compliance function and representatives from our business units 
the controls and compliance committee meets periodically to review and address corporate compliance policies and is charged with monitoring  implementing and educating the company on control and compliance topics and initiatives 
ongoing development and enhancement 
we frequently seek to increase the number of risks we monitor in part through quantitative risk distributions  even where we believe that such quantitative analysis is not as robust or well developed as our tools and models for measuring and evaluating other risks  such as catastrophe and market risks 
we also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks 
we believe effective risk management is a continual process that requires ongoing improvement and development 
we seek from time to time to identify new best practices or additional developments both from within our industry and from other sectors 
we believe that our ongoing efforts to embed erm throughout our organization is important to our efforts to produce and maintain a competitive advantage to achieve our corporate goals 
our erm is currently rated excellent by s p which is s p s highest erm rating

reserves for claims and claim expenses claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 

table of contents the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total the decrease in the total amount of claims and claim expense reserves from december  to december   as shown in the table above  was principally a result of the payment of claims in respect of current and prior year losses of million and million  respectively  in particular the prior year losses resulting from the large hurricanes of  offset by claims and claim expenses incurred of million including european windstorm kyrill kyrill  the united kingdom uk flood losses and sub prime related casualty losses as discussed below 
our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million  increased our net income by million and reduced our net loss by million  respectively 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
our claims and claim expense reserves are reviewed annually by an external actuarial firm 
the actuarial firm performs this work for the purpose of issuing an actuarial opinion on the reasonableness of the claims and claim expense reserves for each of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the actuarial opinions are required to meet various insurance regulatory requirements 
the actuarial firm discusses its conclusions with management and presents its findings to the audit committee of our board of directors of the company 
although we do not explicitly rely on the work performed by the actuarial firm for estimating our reserves for claims and claim expenses  we compare our recorded claims and claim expense reserves to those estimated by the actuarial firm to determine whether our estimates are within the actuarial firm s 
table of contents reasonable range of estimates 
to date  our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves have been within the actuarial firm s reasonable range of estimates 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and is subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  the sub prime related casualty net claims and claim expenses are based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
during  we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimates of these losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from our clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in particular  due to the size and unusual complexity of certain legal and claims issues  particularly but not exclusively relating to hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  our loss estimates 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
refer to our claims and claim expense reserves critical accounting estimates discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units

within our reinsurance segment  the catastrophe reinsurance unit experienced million of favorable development on prior years estimated ultimate claim reserves  principally as a result of a reduction of the ultimate losses for the and accident years as reported claims have been  to date  less than expected 
included in the accident year is a million reduction in net claims and claim expenses associated with hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our specialty reinsurance unit experienced million of favorable development in the favorable development within our specialty reinsurance unit and individual risk segment was principally driven by the application of our formulaic actuarial reserving methodology for these books of business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being more favorable to date than what was originally anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves 
at december   the prior year favorable development of million included million attributable to our reinsurance segment and million attributable to our individual risk segment 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate claims reserves in our reinsurance segment was primarily due to lower than expected claims emergence within our specialty reinsurance unit 
our specialty reinsurance unit experienced million of favorable development in while our catastrophe reinsurance unit experienced million of adverse development 
the reductions in our reserves for our specialty reinsurance unit and individual risk segment were principally driven by the application of our formulaic reserving methodology used for these books of business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what was anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves 
in addition  within our specialty reinsurance unit  million of the favorable development was driven by a reduction in carried reserves due to commutations 
the adverse development in our catastrophe reinsurance unit was principally driven by an increase in our ultimate losses for a uk industrial property loss 
this loss occurred at the end of and both the estimate of insured industry losses for this event and our estimate of our client s losses from this event increased in at december   the prior year favorable development of million included million attributable to our reinsurance segment and million attributable to our individual risk segment 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate claims reserves was primarily due to the reinsurance and individual risk reserve reviews we undertook during  which produced a reduction of million in the reinsurance segment and million in the individual risk segment 
within the reinsurance segment  our property catastrophe portfolio experienced a million reduction in prior year reserves as a result of the reserve review 
this reduction reflected a reassessment of our reserves for claims and claim 
table of contents expenses in light of historical paid loss trends and reported loss activity for the to accident years 
for the specialty reinsurance business  the million reduction in prior year reserves was principally due to a reassessment of our estimated loss reporting patterns 
since establishing the specialty reinsurance business unit in  reported claim activity has been less than expected and therefore  the company adjusted its estimated loss reporting patterns in to reflect this experience 
the changes within the individual risk segment as a result of the reserve review were insignificant 
net claims and claim expenses incurred were reduced by million during million  million related to income earned on assumed reinsurance contracts that were classified as deposit contracts with underwriting risk only 
other income was reduced by million during reduced by million  increased by million related to premiums and losses incurred on assumed reinsurance contracts that were classified as deposit contracts with timing risk only 
aggregate deposit liabilities of million are included in reinsurance balances payable at december  million and aggregate deposit assets of nil are included in other assets at december  nil associated with these contracts

our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
the large majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities 
we also have an allocation to other investments  including hedge funds  private equity partnerships and other investments 
at december   these other investments totaled million or million or of our total investments 
at december   our fixed maturities available for sale and short term investment portfolio had a dollar weighted average credit quality rating of aa aa and an average yield to maturity of  before investment expenses 
at december   our non investment grade fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million or million or of our fixed maturity investments available for sale 
in addition  within our other investments category we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities 
at december   the funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities totaled million million 

table of contents we also hold a significant amount of short term investments 
short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased 
short term investments are carried at cost which approximates fair value 
at december   we had  million of short term investments  million 
our target benchmark portfolio for our fixed maturities and short term investments currently has a year duration 
our duration at december  was years years  reflecting our view that the current level of rates affords inadequate compensation for the assumption of additional interest rate risk associated with longer duration 
from time to time  we may reevaluate the duration of our portfolio in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions 
as with other fixed income investments  the value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in the overall investment market and in overall economic conditions 
additionally  our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments 
examples of some of these risks include changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to prepayment risk on our mortgage backed investments 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
when we receive these prepayments  our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets would likely be at reduced interest rates 
conversely  when interest rates increase  consumers will generally make fewer prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities would be repaid to us less quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
this will increase the duration of our portfolio  which is disadvantageous to us in a rising interest rate environment 
our investments in mortgage backed securities are also subject to default risk 
this risk is due in part to defaults on the underlying securitized mortgages  which would decrease the market value of the investment and be disadvantageous to us 
our investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment risks  as noted above  and to the structural risks of these securities 
the structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer s overall capital structure 
our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations  and our investment portfolio can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads even if specific securities are not downgraded 
within our other investments category  we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities as well as securities denominated in foreign currencies 
these investments expose us to losses from insolvencies and other credit related issues 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may result in realized losses to us if our exposures are not hedged or if our hedging strategies are not effective 
the fair value of certain of our other investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments  if applicable 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sale which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our hedge fund and private equity partnership valuations are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications 
interest income  income distributions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments are included in net investment income and totaled million for million  million of which million million  million was related to net unrealized gains

table of contents rihl rihl was formed to enhance administrative efficiency and take advantage of the increased benefits and reduced costs ordinarily associated with the management of large investment portfolios of different subsidiaries in the same group 
in addition  the administrative efficiency afforded by the use of rihl facilitates the establishment of our collateralized letter of credit facility on advantageous terms that we believe would otherwise not be available

exposure to sub prime global financial markets experienced significant stress during the third and fourth quarters of and early  primarily driven by challenging conditions in the markets related to us sub prime mortgages including cdos based on sub prime collateral  and in the markets for loans and bonds related to leveraged finance transactions collectively referred to as sub prime 
this adverse market environment began to intensify toward the end of july and was characterized by significant credit spread widening  prolonged illiquidity  reduced price transparency and increased volatility 
as conditions in these markets deteriorated  other areas such as the asset backed commercial paper market also experienced decreased liquidity and the equity markets experienced short term weakness and increased volatility

certain of these market participants have had their financial strength ratings put on review for possible downgrade by various rating agencies  or such ratings were downgraded and the market capitalization of such participants decreased significantly 
in response and in an effort to stabilize market conditions generally  the federal reserve and other central banks injected significant liquidity into the markets and lowered benchmark interest rates 
based in part on published news and research reports  further deterioration in the performance of the sub prime mortgage sector appears to be generally expected  however  the extent and duration of the current deterioration in the credit markets more broadly is unknown 
it is possible that the continued deterioration in the credit markets noted above would significantly adversely impact the overall economy  which could directly or indirectly give rise to adverse impacts on us  potentially including impacts we can not currently reasonably foresee 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to address such credit deterioration in the markets will be implemented  or that if implemented would be successful 

table of contents we believe that the company is currently principally exposed to sub prime through its investments in ventures accounted for under the equity method  its investment portfolio and through its underwriting portfolio 
following is a summary of our current estimates relating to these exposures 
investments in other ventures under equity method 
during  channelre  a privately owned financial guaranty reinsurer  of which we own  and whose sole cedant is mbia  suffered a significant net loss which reduced channelre s gaap shareholders equity below nil 
the net loss was driven by unrealized mark to market losses related to financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap 
as a result  the company reduced its carried value in channelre to nil which negatively impacted our net income by million in as a result of reducing our carried value in channelre to nil  combined with the fact that we have no further contractual obligations to provide capital or other support to channelre  we believe we currently have no further negative economic exposure to channelre 
during the fourth quarter of  we invested million in the preferred equity of aladdin 
aladdin is a newly formed aaa rated credit derivatives company and provides credit protection on fixed income securities in return for a premium 
aladdin s business is to accept exposure to credit markets and  thus  its results of operations  and our equity pick up  will fluctuate significantly based on credit markets 
as of december   aladdin was still in its initial start up phase and had not written any business 
the company s current maximum economic exposure to aladdin is its current carrying value of million 
investments 
at december   the company had nil positions in fixed income securities backed by sub prime loan collateral within its portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments 
the company s investment guidelines and or standing orders prohibit our fixed income investment managers from investing in securities supported by sub prime collateral 
in addition  our guidelines require that all securitized assets in our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments be aaa rated and prohibit investments in cdos  collateralized loan obligations clos and home equity loans as well as fixed income investments where the credit rating is backed by a financial guaranty company 
at december   we had million in hedge fund investments and million in private equity investments 
our hedge funds and private equity investments are generally managed by diversified multi strategy managers who we currently do not believe are over exposed to any one sector 
our hedge fund managers independently direct and control the underlying investments and positions of such funds  and it is possible that through these funds we have more indirect exposure to sub prime developments than we have currently estimated  or that such exposure may increase in future periods 
within our private equity portfolio  we have exposure to sub prime through underlying portfolio investments  such as financial institutions  which have been impacted by sub prime 
overall  we estimate that our exposure to sub prime in our portfolio of hedge funds and private equity investments is limited as of december  while our current positions in sub prime within our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale is nil  and our exposure within our hedge fund and private equity portfolio is limited  we may amend our investment guidelines in future periods and or may elect to assume exposure to this and or other more risky asset classes if we believe we are being paid appropriately to assume this additional risk 
underwriting portfolio 
the company s reinsurance portfolio is exposed to risks relating to sub prime mortgage litigation  including claims against financial institutions and other organizations involved in the underwriting  soliciting  documentation collateralization  brokering  marketing  rating or purchase of sub prime mortgages including through derivative instruments 
we believe that the sub prime situation in the us will likely have an effect on other lines in the insurance industry  mainly directors officers d o  errors omissions e o and other professional lines coverage 
it appears that a large number of professional service firms could be affected across these lines 
our casualty clash book of business  within the specialty unit of our reinsurance segment  has exposure to sub prime losses through the d o and e o market 
our estimate of these losses at december  is million and this loss is included in our reinsurance segment results for in addition  our specialty unit has exposure to risks relating to the decrease in home demand through our surety book of business  which could lead to delays and defaults in projects  and could cause additional losses  although we currently believe we have no sub prime related losses in our surety book of business 

table of contents marketing reinsurance we believe that our modeling and technical expertise  the risk management advice that we provide to our clients  and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide

we believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and clients for prompt response on underwriting submissions  fast claims payments and a reputation for providing creative solutions to our customers needs 
since we selectively write large lines on a limited number of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts  we can establish reinsurance terms and conditions on those contracts that are attractive in our judgment  make large commitments to the most attractive programs and provide superior client responsiveness 
we believe that our willingness and ability to design customized programs and to provide advice on catastrophe risk management has helped us to develop long term relationships with brokers and clients 
our reinsurance brokers assess client needs and perform data collection  contract preparation and other administrative tasks  enabling us to market our reinsurance products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff 
we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers  we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds 
in recent years  our distribution has become increasingly reliant on a small number of such relationships 
we expect this concentration to continue and perhaps increase

employees at february   we and our subsidiaries employed people worldwide 
we believe our strong employee relations are among our most significant strengths 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements at any of our subsidiaries 
we believe that our employee headcount will increase over time as we expand our operations and seek to further develop our capabilities 
a majority of our employees and all of our officers and directors receive some form of equity based incentive compensation as part of their overall compensation package 
at february   our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common shares 
in addition  all of our directors and executive officers are subject to equity ownership guidelines that require each to hold a specified amount of equity

these permits expire at various times over the next few years 
substantially all of our officers are working in bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next three years 
the bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits  which would adversely impact us 
bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions for key employees  although we can provide no assurance that the bermuda government may not seek to revoke the six year exemption for key employees 
all of our senior executives and many of our senior officers are subject to employment agreements providing for  among other things  confidentiality  non solicitation and non competition obligations on the part of the executives and provisions relating to our indemnification and severance obligations 

table of contents information technology our information technology infrastructure is important to our business 
our information technology platform  supported by a team of professionals  is currently principally located in our corporate headquarters and principal corporate offices in bermuda 
additional information technology assets are maintained at the office locations of our operating subsidiaries 
we have implemented backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are backed up  generally on a daily basis  and can be restored promptly if and as needed 
in addition  we generally store backup information at off site locations  in order to seek to minimize our risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster 
we have implemented and periodically test our disaster recovery plans with respect to our information technology infrastructure 
among other things  our recovery plans involve arrangements with off site  secure data centers in alternative locations 
we believe we will be able to access our systems from these facilities in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to a scenario such as a natural disaster 
regulation bermuda regulation registration 
the insurance act  as amended  and related regulations the insurance act  which regulates the business of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries  provides that no person may carry on an insurance business including the business of reinsurance in or from within bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the insurance act by the bermuda monetary authority the bma 
as a holding company  renaissancere is not subject to bermuda insurance law and regulations 
however  as discussed in detail below  the insurance act and related regulations thereof regulate the insurance business of most of our operating insurance companies 
renaissance reinsurance and davinci are registered as class insurers  and glencoe  lantana  tim re  starbound re and top layer re are registered as class insurers under the insurance act 
the bma  in deciding whether to grant registration  has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest 
the bma is required by the insurance act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and  in particular  whether it has  or has available to it  adequate knowledge and expertise 
in connection with the applicant s registration  the bma may impose conditions relating to the writing of certain types of insurance 
further  the insurance act stipulates that no person shall  in or from within bermuda  act as an insurance manager  broker  agent or salesman unless registered for the purpose by the bma 
the insurance act also grants to the bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
ventures is registered as an insurance manager under the insurance act 
the insurance act imposes on bermuda insurance companies certain solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements 
the insurance act also grants the bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
certain significant aspects of the bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below 
cancellation of insurer s registration 
an insurer s registration may be canceled by the bma on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including failure of the insurer to comply with a requirement made of it under the insurance act or if  in the opinion of the bma  after consultation with the insurance advisory committee  the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
independent approved auditor 
every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer  both of which  in the case of each of a class insurer and a class insurer  are required to be filed annually with the bma 
the auditor must be approved by the bma as the independent auditor of the insurer 
if the insurer fails to appoint an approved auditor or at any time fails to fill a vacancy for such auditor  the bma may appoint an approved auditor for the insurer and shall fix the remuneration to be paid to the approved auditor within fourteen days  if not agreed sooner by the insurer and the auditor 
the approved auditor may be the same person or firm which audits the insurer s financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders 

table of contents loss reserve specialist 
each class and class insurer is required to submit an annual loss reserve opinion on the adequacy of the loss and loss expense provisions reflected in an insurer s statutory financial statements and statutory financial return and other matters required by the bma when filing the annual statutory financial return 
this opinion must be issued by the insurer s approved loss reserve specialist 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified casualty actuary  must be approved by the bma 
statutory financial statements 
an insurer must prepare annual statutory financial statements 
the insurance act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of such statutory financial statements which include  in statutory form  a balance sheet  income statement  and a statement of capital and surplus  and detailed notes thereto 
the insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance and investments 
the statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with gaap and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer s shareholders under the companies act of bermuda  as amended the companies act  which financial statements may be prepared in accordance with gaap 
the insurer is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of the annual statutory financial return 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions 
the insurance act provides that the statutory assets of an insurer must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin which varies with the type of registration of the insurer under the insurance act and the insurer s net premiums written and loss reserve level 
the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer with respect to its general business is the greatest of million  of net premiums written with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding of gross premiums and of loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer with respect to its general business is the greater of million or of the first million of net premiums written  if in excess of million  the figure shall be million plus of net premiums written in excess of million 
the insurance act mandates certain actions and filings with the bma if a class insurer or a class insurer fails to meet and or maintain the required minimum solvency margin 
both class insurers and class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio the relevant margins or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the relevant margins 
where an insurer fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year  it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the bma 
further  a class insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files at least seven days before payment of such dividends with the bma an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its relevant margins 
class insurers and class insurers must obtain the bma s prior approval for a reduction by or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year s financial statements 
these restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the insurance act are in addition to those under the companies act which apply to all bermuda companies 
minimum liquidity ratio 
the insurance act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business 
an insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than of the amount of its relevant liabilities 
relevant assets include cash and time deposits  quoted investments  unquoted bonds and debentures  first liens on real estate  investment income due and accrued  accounts and premiums receivable  and reinsurance balances receivable 
there are certain categories of assets  which  unless specifically permitted by the bma  do not qualify as relevant assets  such as unquoted equity securities  investments in and advances to affiliates  and real estate and collateral loans 
the relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and sundry liabilities by interpretation  those not specifically defined 

table of contents annual statutory financial return 
class and class insurers are required to file with the bma a statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer s financial year end unless specifically extended 
the statutory financial return includes  among other items  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer  a declaration of the statutory ratios  a solvency certificate  the statutory financial statements themselves  the opinion of the approved loss reserve specialist in respect of the loss and loss expense provisions and  only in the case of class insurers  certain details concerning ceded reinsurance 
the solvency certificate and the declaration of the statutory ratios must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer  who are required to state whether the minimum solvency margin and  in the case of the solvency certificate  the minimum liquidity ratio  have been met  and the independent approved auditor is required to state whether in its opinion it was reasonable for them to so state and whether the declaration of the statutory ratios complies with the requirements of the insurance act 
where an insurer s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the insurance act  a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return 
supervision  investigation and intervention 
the bma may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if the bma believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurer s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders 
in order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to them  the bma may direct an insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with the insurer s business 
moreover  the bma has the power to appoint professional persons to prepare reports about registered insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe 
if it appears to the bma to be desirable in the interests of policyholders  the bma may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries  parents and other affiliates of registered insurers 
an inspector may examine on oath any past or present officer  employee or insurance manager of the insurer under investigation in relation to its business and apply to the court in bermuda for an order that other persons may also be examined on any matter relevant to the investigation 
it will be the duty of any insurer in relation to whose affairs an inspector has been appointed and of any past or present officer  employee or insurance manager of such insurer  to produce to the inspector on request all books  records and documents relating to the insurer under investigation which are in its or his custody or control and otherwise to give to the inspector all assistance in connection with the investigation which it or he is reasonably able to give 
if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of the insurer becoming insolvent  or that the insurer is in breach of the insurance act or any conditions of its registration under the insurance act  the bma may direct the insurer not to take on any new insurance business  not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurer s liabilities  not to make certain investments  to realize or not to realize certain investments  to maintain in  or transfer to the custody of  a specified bank  certain assets  not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments and or to limit its premium income and to remove a controller or officer 
in addition to powers under the insurance act to investigate the affairs of an insurer  the bma may require certain information from an insurer or certain other persons to be produced to them 
the bma has the power to assist other regulatory authorities  including foreign insurance regulatory authorities  with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in bermuda if the bma is satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities and that such cooperation is in the public interest 
the grounds for disclosure by the bma to a foreign regulatory authority without consent of the insurer are limited and the insurance act provides for sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality 
in  the bma commenced an on site review of the company which concluded in march with no significant action points identified 
under the companies act  the insurance supervisor has been given powers to assist a foreign regulatory authority which has requested assistance in connection with inquiries being carried out by it in the performance of its regulatory functions 
the insurance supervisor s powers include requiring a person to furnish him with information  to produce documents to him  to attend and answer questions and to give assistance in connection with enquiries 
the insurance supervisor must be satisfied that the assistance 
table of contents requested by the foreign regulatory authority is for the purpose of its regulatory functions and that the request is in relation to information in bermuda which a person has in his possession or under his control 
the insurance supervisor must consider  among other things  whether it is in the public interest to give the information sought 
any person who  directly or indirectly  becomes a holder of at least   or of the common shares of the company must notify the bma in writing within days of becoming such a holder or days from the date they have knowledge of such a holding  whichever is later 
the bma may  by written notice  object to such person if it appears to the bma that the person is not fit and proper to be such a holder 
the bma may require the holder to reduce their holding of common shares in the company and direct  among other things  that the voting rights attaching to the common shares shall not be exercisable 
a person that does not comply with such a notice or direction from the bma will be guilty of an offense 
an insurer is required to maintain a principal office in bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in bermuda 
for the purpose of the insurance act  the principal office of our bermuda registered insurance companies is our office at renaissance house  east broadway  pembroke hm bermuda 
without a reason acceptable to the bma  an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative  and the principal representative may not cease to act as such  unless fourteen days notice in writing to the bma is given of the intention to do so 
it is the duty of the principal representative  having formed the view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which he acts becoming insolvent or its coming to his knowledge  or his having reason to believe that a reportable event has occurred  to orally notify the bma immediately and  within fourteen days of the relevant view having been formed  to make a report in writing to the bma setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to him 
examples of such an event include failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the bma relating to a solvency margin  a liquidity ratio or other ratio 
certain other bermuda law considerations 
as exempted companies  we and our bermuda subsidiaries are exempt from certain bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non bermudians 
however  as exempted companies  we and our bermuda subsidiaries may not participate in certain business transactions  including the acquisition or holding of land in bermuda except that required for their business and held by way of lease or tenancy for terms of not more than years without required authorization  the taking of mortgages on land in bermuda to secure an amount in excess of  without the consent of the insurance supervisor  the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in bermuda  other than certain types of bermuda government securities or securities issued by bermuda public authorities or  the carrying on of business of any kind in bermuda  except in furtherance of our business carried on outside bermuda or under license granted by the insurance supervisor 
generally it is not permitted without a special license granted by the insurance supervisor to insure bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of  in or based in bermuda 
we and our bermuda subsidiaries must comply with the provisions of the companies act regulating the payment of dividends and making distributions from contributed surplus 
a company may not declare or pay a dividend  or make a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a the company is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or b the realizable value of the company s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
we anticipate that the requirements with respect to solvency capital requirements will be enacted in and based on our review of published consultation papers and our internal models  we do not currently believe our capital requirements would be impacted by the new regulations 
us regulation reinsurance regulation 
our bermuda domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures principally consist of renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe and lantana 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci  starbound ii and top layer re are bermuda based companies that operate as reinsurers 
although none of these companies are admitted to transact the business of insurance in any jurisdiction except bermuda  the insurance laws of each state of the us regulate the sale of reinsurance to ceding insurers authorized in the 
table of contents state by non admitted alien reinsurers  such as renaissance reinsurance or davinci  acting from locations outside the state 
rates  policy terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority 
a primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement  however  only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its statutory financial statements 
in general  regulators permit ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance in the following circumstances if the reinsurer is licensed in the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled or  in some instances  in certain states in which the primary insurer is licensed  if the reinsurer is an accredited or otherwise approved reinsurer in the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled or  in some instances  in certain states in which the primary insurer is licensed  in some instances  if the reinsurer a is domiciled in a state that is deemed to have substantially similar credit for reinsurance standards as the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled and b meets certain financial requirements  or if none of the above apply  to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately  typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the primary insurer or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the primary insurer 
as alien companies  our bermuda subsidiaries collateralize their reinsurance obligations to us insurance companies 
with some exceptions  the sale of insurance or reinsurance from within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited 
neither renaissance reinsurance nor davinci intends to maintain an office or to solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction other than bermuda where the conduct of such activities would require that each company be so admitted 
the financial condition committee of the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a framework memorandum that outlines a proposal to modernize the current us reinsurance regulatory framework 
the proposal includes the creation of the naic reinsurance supervision review department rsrd to determine which foreign regulatory regimes are functionally equivalent to that of the united states  entitling them to enter into mutual recognition agreements 
in addition  the creation of a port of entry certification process is proposed that would allow non us reinsurers from rsrd approved jurisdictions to enter the us reinsurance market through a single jurisdiction 
the establishment of appropriate collateral levels from zero to for both us and us reinsurers is listed as an outstanding issue in the proposal 
if the changes contemplated by the framework memorandum ultimately lead to a reduction of the collateral requirements for non us reinsurers  such changes could be beneficial to our bermuda subsidiaries by permitting them to post less collateral to secure their respective reinsurance obligations to their respective us ceding companies 
at this time  we are unable to determine whether any changes in the us reinsurance regulatory framework will be implemented based on the foregoing proposal and the effect  if any  such changes would have on our operations or financial condition 
excess and surplus lines regulation 
glencoe and lantana  both domiciled in bermuda  are not licensed in the us but are eligible to offer coverage in the us exclusively in the surplus lines market 
glencoe and lantana are eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance in and jurisdictions of the us  respectively  and each is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which it is eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance 
in accordance with certain provisions of the naic nonadmitted insurance model act  which provisions have been adopted by a number of states  glencoe and lantana have each established  and are required to maintain  a trust funded to a minimum amount as a condition of its status as an eligible  non admitted insurer in the us the regulation of surplus lines insurance differs significantly from the licensed or admitted market 
the regulations governing the surplus lines market have been designed to facilitate the procurement of coverage  through specially licensed surplus lines brokers  for hard to place risks that do not fit standard underwriting criteria and are otherwise eligible to be written on a surplus lines basis 
most particularly  
table of contents surplus lines regulation generally provides for more flexible rules relating to insurance rates and forms 
however  strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements under the laws of every state  and state insurance regulations generally require that a risk must be declined by three admitted carriers before it may be placed in the surplus lines market 
initial eligibility requirements and annual requalification standards apply to insurance carriers writing on a surplus basis and filing obligations must also be met 
in most states  surplus lines brokers are responsible for collecting and remitting the surplus lines tax payable to the state where the risk is located 
companies such as glencoe and lantana which conduct business on a surplus lines basis in a particular state are generally exempt from that state s guaranty fund laws 
admitted market regulation 
our admitted us operations currently consist of stonington and stonington lloyds  both texas domiciled insurers 
stonington is licensed to write primary insurance in states and the district of columbia 
stonington lloyds is a texas lloyds company licensed to write primary insurance in texas 
stonington acts as an attorney in fact for stonington lloyds 
in addition  our insurance company subsidiaries newstead insurance company newstead and inverness insurance company inverness have certificates of authority as admitted  licensed insurers in delaware and arizona  respectively  although newstead and inverness have not yet conducted any business 
as licensed insurers operating in the admitted market  these companies are subject to extensive regulation under us statutes 
the extent of regulation varies from state to state but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state 
among other things  state insurance commissioners regulate insurer solvency standards  insurer licensing  authorized investments  premium rates  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy  loss and expense reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  policy form approval  policy renewals and non renewals  and market conduct regulation including both underwriting and claims practices 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and quarterly financial reports 
the texas department of insurance retains primary regulatory authority for stonington and stonington lloyds  the delaware department of insurance is the primary regulator for newstead and the arizona department of insurance is inverness primary regulator 
in general  licensed us insurers must file with the state departments of insurance in whose states they insure risks all rates for directly underwritten insurance 
licensed us insurers are required to participate in the guaranty associations of the states where they conduct business 
such participation can result in assessments  up to prescribed limits  for losses incurred by policyholders as a result of the impairment or insolvency of other insurance companies 
additionally  some states require licensed insurers to participate in assigned risk plans or other residual market mechanisms which provide coverage with respect to certain lines for insureds that are unable to obtain insurance in the open market 
participation in these residual market mechanisms may take various forms including reinsuring a portion of a pool of policies or directly issuing policies to insureds 
an insurer s participation in these plans is typically calculated based on the amount of premium written by the insurer on a voluntary basis for that line of coverage in a prior year 
assigned risk pools generally produce losses which result in assessments to insurers writing the same or similar lines on a voluntary basis 
while we expect the exposure in our admitted companies to assessments to generally grow over time  as a result of our growth and the relative change in our product mix  we do not expect the amount of any such guaranty fund assessments  if any  or other assessments to be paid by our admitted companies in to be material 
holding company regulation 
we and our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various jurisdictions 
the insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but generally require an insurance holding company  and insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies  to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports  including information concerning their capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
further  in order to protect insurance company solvency  state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies 
for example  texas  stonington s and stonington lloyds state of domicile  currently requires that dividends be paid only out of earned statutory surplus and limits the annual amount of dividends payable without the prior approval of the 
table of contents texas department of insurance to the greater of of statutory capital and surplus at the end of the previous calendar year or of statutory net income from operations for the previous calendar year 
because of the accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington currently cannot pay an ordinary dividend 
these insurance holding company laws also impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions with affiliates 
in addition  as a result of our ownership of stonington  stonington lloyds  newstead and inverness under the terms of applicable state statutes  any person or entity desiring to purchase more than of our outstanding voting securities is required to obtain prior regulatory approval for the purchase 
terrorism 
in november  tria was signed into law by the us president 
tria provides for the federal government to share the risk of loss from certain future terrorist attacks with the insurance industry 
each participating insurance company must pay covered losses equal to a deductible based on a percentage of direct earned premiums for specified commercial insurance lines from the previous calendar year 
tria was originally scheduled to expire at the end of  but was extended in december for an additional two years 
as extended  the insurer deductible was increased from in to in for losses in excess of an insurer s deductible  the federal government covered of the excess losses in  while insurers retained the remaining  with the government s share decreasing to in losses covered by the program remained capped annually at billion 
the extended tria established a new program trigger under which federal compensation became available only if aggregate insured losses sustained by all insurers exceeded million from a certified act of terrorism that occurred after march  and million for losses resulting from a certified act that occurred on or after january  in addition to the new trigger  the million certification threshold continues to apply in order for an event to be certified 
although tria was scheduled to expire at the end of  the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of was signed into law by the us president on december  this law renews the existing terrorism risk insurance program for seven years  through december  certain provisions of tria were modified by the reauthorization 
the program was expanded to include domestic terrorism by eliminating from the definition of a certified act of terrorism the requirement that such an act be perpetrated on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest 
the insurer deductible is now fixed at of an insurer s direct earned premium  and the federal share of compensation is fixed at of insured losses that exceed insurer deductibles 
the us treasury department is required to promulgate regulations to determine the pro rata share of insured losses if they exceed the billion cap 
in addition  clear and conspicuous notice to policyholders of the billion cap is required 
under the program reauthorization  the trigger at which federal compensation becomes available remains fixed at million per year through naic ratios 
the naic has established financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed us insurance companies operating in their respective states 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris calculates these ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments 
each ratio has an established usual range of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
a ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios is not considered a failing result  rather unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system 
furthermore  in some years  it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges 
an insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial 
generally  an insurance company will be subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges with respect to four or more of the ratios 
risk based capital 
the naic has implemented a risk based capital rbc formula and model law applicable to all licensed us property casualty insurance companies 
the rbc formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business 
such analysis permits regulators to identify inadequately capitalized insurers 
the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory capital by applying certain factors to insurers business risks such as asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
the target level of statutory surplus varies not 
table of contents only as a result of the insurer s size  but also on the risk profile of the insurer s operations 
insurers that have less statutory capital than the rbc calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank such companies 
our us insurance subsidiaries have satisfied the rbc formula since it was created in the mid s and have exceeded all recognized industry solvency standards 
as of february   all of our us insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action 
the gramm leach bliley act 
the gramm leach bliley act of glba permits mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company  a financial holding company 
until passage of the glba  the glass steagall act of  as amended  had limited the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses  and the bank holding company act of  as amended  had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers 
as a result of glba  the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may affect our us subsidiaries product lines by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
privacy provisions of glba became fully effective in these provisions established consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information and require full disclosure of the privacy policies of financial institutions  including us insurers  to their consumer customers 
flood insurance 
on september   the us house of representatives passed legislation  hr  the flood insurance reform and modernization act firma  which would renew  expand and alter the national flood insurance program nfip 
the nfip  which is operated by the federal emergency management agency fema  provides subsidized flood insurance in identified flood plain zones 
the nfip is currently estimated to insure approximately five million policyholders in  communities and has a deficit of approximately billion 
the firma bill passed by the house of representatives includes a provision  sponsored by rep 
gene taylor d ms the taylor amendment  that would expand the nfip to cover damage to or loss of real or related personal property located in the us arising from any windstorm any hurricane  tornado  cyclone  typhoon  or other wind event 
the taylor amendment  as approved by the house  would provide coverage up to million for a single family dwelling  million for a dwelling unit within a multiple dwelling structure  approximately million for the contents of a dwelling unit  million for non residential properties  and approximately million for the contents of a non residential property 
on september   firma  as amended  was referred to the us senate committee on banking  housing  and urban affairs 
homeowners insurance 
on september   the committee on financial services of the us house of representatives approved another proposed bill  hr  the homeowners defense act of co sponsored by reps 
ron klein d fl and tim mahoney d fl the klein mahoney bill 
the klein mahoney bill would a create a national catastrophe risk consortium and b would require the us treasury department to establish a national homeowners insurance stabilization program 
the national catastrophe risk consortium program would allow multiple participating states to pool state sponsored catastrophic risk insured or reinsured in wind pools or other residual markets 
the stabilization program would allow the us treasury department to make below cost loans to participating states or their reinsurance pools and or residual markets 
on november   senators clinton d ny and nelson d fl introduced a companion bill to the klein mahoney bill in the us senate  s 
 the clinton nelson bill  which was referred to the us senate committee on banking  housing  and urban affairs 
on november   the us house of representatives passed the homeowners defense act of  as amended the hda 
on november   the hda was referred to the us senate committee on banking  housing  and urban affairs 
the us senate has not yet approved the hda  the clinton nelson bill or firma  as amended by the taylor amendment 
in addition  the white house indicated a potential presidential veto of firma and a prior version of the hda 
at this time  we are unable to determine whether this legislation or similar legislation will be adopted 
passage of such legislation would adversely affect us  perhaps materially 

table of contents legislative and regulatory proposals 
government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets  both in the us and worldwide  continues to evolve 
for example  in  florida enacted insurance related legislation that expanded the reinsurance coverages offered by the fhcf and the primary insurance business that may be written by the state sponsored citizens  summarized in more detail below 
this legislation caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written in as compared to see risk factors  management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations and current outlook for additional disclosure 
we are monitoring a number of potential federal and state legislative initiatives 
while we cannot predict the exact nature  timing  or scope of other such proposals  if adopted they could adversely affect our business by providing government supported insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  such as the legislation enacted in florida in early  described in more detail below  requiring our participation in pools and guaranty associations  regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  impacting producer compensation  or disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another 
new federal legislation  the non admitted and reinsurance reform act of nrra  was introduced in february the bill was passed without amendment by the us house of representatives on june  and referred to the committee on banking  housing and urban affairs in the us senate 
if enacted in its current form  the nrra would set federal standards regarding state regulation of both reinsurance and the surplus lines insurance market 
the nrra would i grant sole regulatory authority with respect to the placement of non admitted insurance to the policyholder s home state  ii limit states to uniform standards for surplus lines eligibility in conformity with the naic non admitted insurance model act  iii establish a streamlined insurance procurement process for exempt commercial purchasers by eliminating the requirement that brokers conduct a due diligence search to determine whether the insurance is available from admitted insurers  iv establish the domicile state of the ceding insurer as the sole regulatory authority with respect to credit for reinsurance and solvency determinations if such state is an naic accredited state or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar to those required for such accreditation and v require that premium taxes related to non admitted insurance only be paid to the policyholder s home state  although the states may enter into a compact or establish procedures to allocate such premium taxes among the states 
it is not certain whether nrra will be approved by the senate in its current form 
in addition  the insurance industry competition act of the iica was introduced in the us senate and the us house of representatives in february the iica  if enacted in its current form  would remove the insurance industry s antitrust exemption created by the mccarran ferguson act 
if enacted in its current form  the iica would  among other things  i effect a different judicial standard providing that joint conduct by insurance companies  such as price sharing  would be subject to scrutiny by the us department of justice unless the conduct was undertaken pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy that is actively supervised by the state and ii delegate authority to the us federal trade commission to identify insurance industry practices that are not anti competitive 
passage of the iica could adversely impact the insurance industry  and might have an impact on our operations 
we are unable to predict whether any of the foregoing proposed legislation  or any other proposed laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 
in addition  the expansion of our primary insurance operations  together with the potential of further expansion into additional insurance markets  could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight 
however  we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that renaissance reinsurance  davinci  top layer  starbound ii  or any other bermudian subsidiaries will become subject to direct us regulation 

table of contents in january  the state of florida enacted legislation known as bill no 
cs hb a that increased the access of primary florida insurers to the fhcf 
through the fhcf  the state of florida provides below market rate reinsurance of up to billion per season  an increase from the previous cap of billion  with the state able to further increase the limits up to an additional billion per season 
in addition  the legislation allows florida insurers to choose a lower retention level for fhcf reinsurance coverage  as well as optional additional coverage above the mandatory fhcf coverage amount  at specified rates for specified layers of coverage 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of citizens property insurance corporation  a state sponsored entity  to compete with private insurance companies  such as ours 
in sum  the legislation reduced the role of the private markets in providing support for florida based risks  a key target market of ours 
while we have sought and intend to continue to seek to utilize our strong relationships  record of superior service and financial strength to mitigate the impact of the legislation  we believe cs hb a caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written in as compared to because of our position as one of the largest providers of catastrophe exposed coverage  both on a global basis and in respect of the florida market  the legislation may have a disproportionate adverse impact on us compared to other market participants 
it is also possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on the florida precedent  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
for example  louisiana is considering setting up its own reinsurance fund similar to the fhcf and allowing louisiana citizens property insurance company  a state sponsored company  to compete with the private sector 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of the fhcf  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the florida market  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
recently  several key political leaders in florida have publicly expressed concern about the amount of risk assumed by the state of florida as a result of the legislative changes in a legislative bill has already been introduced and is currently pending for the session of the florida legislature which proposes to reduce the amount of reinsurance to be offered by the fhcf for the hurricane season 
at this date  however  no assurance can be given that such legislation will be enacted in the form proposed

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this form k and other documents we file with the sec include the following risks related to our company our exposure to catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next  and the frequency and severity of such events could exceed our estimates 
our largest product based on total gross premiums written is property catastrophe reinsurance 
we also sell lines of specialty reinsurance and certain individual risk products that are exposed to catastrophe risk 
we therefore have a large overall exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornados and other natural or man made disasters  such as acts of terrorism 
as a result  our operating results have historically been  and we expect will continue to be  significantly affected by relatively few events of large magnitude 
we expect claims from catastrophic events to cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year  moreover  catastrophic claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to write new business could also be affected 
we believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation will continue to increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
from time to time  we expect to have greater exposures in one or more specific geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market would unilaterally suggest 
accordingly  when catastrophes were to occur in these areas  we may experience relatively more severe net negative impacts from such events than our competitors 
during  we experienced million of net negative impact from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
principally as a result of these hurricane losses in  we recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million 
in  we recorded million of net negative impact from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
while neither nor was characterized by land falling windstorm events resulting in material industry losses  we believe  and recent scientific studies have indicated  that the frequency of hurricanes has increased and may further increase in the future relative to the historical experience over the past years 
we continuously monitor and adjust  as we believe appropriate  our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret current developments and information  such as these studies 
however  it is possible that  even after these adjustments  we have underestimated the frequency or severity of hurricanes or other catastrophes 
we may fail to execute our strategy in our newer lines of business  which would impair our future financial results 
historically  our principal product has been property catastrophe reinsurance 
our specialty reinsurance and individual risk lines of business present us with new and expanded challenges and risks which we may not manage successfully 
we are not as experienced in these lines of business as we are in property catastrophe reinsurance  for example  we are continuing to expand our claims management function to support these newer lines of business 
businesses in early stages of development present substantial business  financial and operational risks and may suffer significant losses 
for example  our current and potential future expansion may require us to develop new client and customer relationships  supplement existing or build new operating procedures  hire staff  develop and install management information and other systems  as well as taking numerous other steps to implement our strategies 
if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  or otherwise fail to execute our strategy  our results from these newer lines of business will likely suffer  perhaps substantially  and our future financial results may be adversely affected 
our expansion into these newer lines of business has placed increased demands on our financial  managerial and human resources 
for example  we may need to attract additional professionals to  or expand our facilities in  bermuda  a small jurisdiction with limited resources 
to the extent we are unable to 
table of contents attract additional professionals  our financial  managerial and human resources may be strained 
the growth in our staff and infrastructure also creates more managerial responsibilities for our current senior executives  potentially diverting their attention from the underwriting and business origination functions for which they are also responsible 
our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and effectively manage this expansion 
our inability to achieve such development or effectively manage this expansion may impair our future financial results 
in general  our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk are much better developed than those for other classes of risk 
in addition  our models are not currently structured to seek to predict long term climate changes  such as those that might be caused by the possible trend toward significant global warming 
moreover  our models and databases may not adequately address the emergence of a variety of matters which might be deemed to impact certain of our coverages  such as the likelihood or potential severity of insured losses from an avian flu pandemic 
accordingly  our models may understate the exposures we are assuming and our financial results may be adversely impacted  perhaps significantly 
our utilization of brokers  program managers and other third parties to support our business exposes us to operational and financial risks 
our individual risk operations rely on program managers  and other agents and brokers participating in our programs  to produce and service a substantial portion of our operations in this segment 
in these arrangements  we typically grant the program manager the right to bind us to newly issued and renewal insurance policies  subject to underwriting guidelines we provide and other contractual restrictions and obligations 
should our program managers issue policies that contravene these guidelines  restrictions or obligations  we could nonetheless be deemed liable for such policies 
although we would intend to resist claims that exceed or expand on our underwriting intention  it is possible that we would not prevail in such an action  or that our program manager would be unable to substantially indemnify us for their contractual breach 
we also rely on our program managers  third party administrators or other third parties we retain  to collect premiums and to pay valid claims 
we could also be exposed to the program manager s or their producer s operational risk  for example  but not limited to  contract wording errors  technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans 
we could also be exposed to potential liabilities relating to the claims practices of the third party administrators we have retained to manage substantially all of the claims activity that we expect to arise in our individual risk operations 
although we have implemented monitoring and other oversight protocols  we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate all of these exposures 
we are also subject to the risk that our successful program managers will not renew their programs with us 
although our contracts are generally not for defined terms  generally  either party can cancel the contract in a relatively short period of time 
while we believe our arrangements offer numerous benefits to our program participants  we cannot assure you we will retain the programs that produce profitable business or that our insureds will renew with us 
failure to retain or replace the program managers  or the program manager s failure to retain or replace their producers  would impair our ability to execute our growth strategy  and our financial results could be adversely affected 
with respect to our reinsurance operations we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance contracts and  accordingly  like other reinsurers  are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies 
we are therefore subject to the risk that our clients may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured  or that the premiums ceded to us will not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume  perhaps materially so 
a decline in the ratings assigned to our financial strength may adversely impact our business  perhaps materially so 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers and insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance  certain operating subsidiaries of glencoe group  top layer re  a joint venture which we indirectly own of  and davinci 
these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies 
periodically  the rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
the financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to 
table of contents reinsurance or insurance companies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
renaissance reinsurance is currently rated a by am best  aa by standard poor s  a by moody s investor services and a by fitch ratings 
top layer re is rated aa by standard poor s and a by am best 
glencoe is rated a by am best 
davinci is rated a by standard poor s and a by am best 
in october  am best affirmed the financial strength ratings fsr and the issuer credit ratings icr of the operating subsidiaries of renaissancere 
these affirmations include the fsr of a and the icr of a of renaissance reinsurance  renaissance europe and davinci  and the fsr of a and the icr of a of the operating subsidiaries of glencoe group 
at such time  all of the ratings affirmed by am best were removed from under review and assigned a stable outlook 
on december   am best raised its icr of renaissance reinsurance and renaissance europe to a from a and affirmed the fcr of a for these two subsidiaries  and the outlook for the ratings of renaissance reinsurance and renaissance reinsurance of europe by am best was revised to positive from stable 
concurrently  am best upgraded the icr to bbb from bbb  the debt ratings on senior notes to bbb from bbb and the ratings on preferred stock to bbb from bb of renaissancere 
am best also upgraded the indicative debt ratings for securities available under shelf registration for renaissancere for senior notes to bbb from bbb  subordinated notes to bbb from bbb and preferred stock to bbb from bb 
in addition  am best assigned an indicative debt rating of bbb to the series d preference shares issued by renaissancere in december the outlook for all ratings has been revised to positive from stable 
on december   standard poor s raised its counterparty credit rating on renaissancere to a from a 
at the same time  standard poor s raised its counterparty credit and fcr on renaissance reinsurance to aa from a 
in addition  standard poor s raised its counterparty credit rating on davinci to a from a 
the outlook on all these companies is stable 
on december   am best upgraded the fsr of renaissance europe from a excellent to a superior and revised the outlook from positive to stable 
concurrently  am best upgraded the icr to a from bbb on the company s senior notes and from bbb to bbb on the company s preferred stock 
the outlook for the icr has been revised to stable from positive  and the outlook for the debt remains stable 
additionally  am best affirmed the fsr of a excellent and the icr of a and the fsr of a excellent and the icrs of a of davinci and glencoe  respectively 
the rating outlook for davinci remains stable and the outlook for glencoe remains positive 
these ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked  by the agencies which issue them 
from time to time one or more ratings agencies have effected changes in their capital models and rating methodologies  which have generally served to increase the amounts of capital required to support the ratings 
for example  following the higher levels of hurricane frequency in and  we understand that the rating agencies undertook to review whether or not to require insurance and reinsurance companies that retain catastrophe risk  such as ourselves  to hold a higher level of capital to support this risk  if the insurance or reinsurance companies are to maintain their ratings 
while the ratings of renaissance reinsurance remain among the highest in our business  negative ratings actions in the future could have an adverse effect on our ability to fully realize the market opportunities we currently expect to participate in over coming periods 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a further downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on the financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
the rating agencies may downgrade or withdraw their fcr in the future if we do not continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers  and our results of operations  could be materially adversely affected by any such ratings downgrade 
for example  following a ratings downgrade we might lose clients to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share of the business of our clients 
the rating of top layer re is dependent in large part upon the rating of state farm  which provides top layer re with billion of stop loss reinsurance 

table of contents our claims and claim expense reserves are subject to inherent uncertainties 
our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates using actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
although we use actuarial and computer models as well as historical reinsurance and insurance industry loss statistics  we also rely heavily on management s experience and judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claim reserves 
however  because of the many assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves  the reserving process is inherently uncertain 
our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations are expected to produce claims which frequently can only be resolved through lengthy and unpredictable litigation 
the measures required to resolve such claims  including the adjudication process  present more reserve challenges than property losses which tend to be reported comparatively more promptly and to be settled within a relatively shorter period of time 
for both our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations  and our traditional property catastrophe business  actual net claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
we expect that some of our assumptions or estimates will prove to be inaccurate  and that our actual net claims and claim expenses paid will differ  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses exceed our expectations  we would be required to increase claims and claim expense reserves 
this would reduce our net income by a corresponding amount in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses are better than our expectations  we would be required to decrease claims and claim expense reserves and this would increase our net income 
in reserving for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and is subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  we believe there is substantial uncertainty in respect of the losses experienced by the industry in respect of sub prime related casualty losses 
the net claims and claim expenses that may emerge in respect of sub prime are in general based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
our estimates of losses from catastrophic events such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  as well as the previously reported hurricanes and windstorms  are based on factors including currently available information derived from our claims information from clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
due to the size and unusual complexity of the legal and claims issues relating to these events  particularly hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations to us 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
unlike the loss reserves of us insurers  the loss reserves of our bermuda insurers  including renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe  are not regularly examined by insurance regulators  although  as 
table of contents registered bermuda insurers  we are required to submit opinions of our approved loss reserve specialist with the annual statutory financial returns of our bermuda licensed insurers with regard to their respective loss and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified actuary  must be approved by the bermuda monetary authority 
the emergence of matters which may impact certain of our coverages  such as the asserted trend toward potentially significant global warming or the potential for significant industry losses from a possible avian flu pandemic  could cause us to underestimate our exposures and potentially adversely impact our financial results 
in our reinsurance business  we use analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
for catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we also seek to utilize proprietary modeling tools that have been developed in conjunction with the modeling and other resources utilized in our reinsurance operations 
see item business underwriting and enterprise risk management 
our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk in our reinsurance and individual risk operations are not currently structured to predict certain types of risks 
our models may fail to adequately address the emergence of matters which may be deemed to impact certain of our coverages  and accordingly may understate the exposures we are assuming 
changing weather patterns and climatic conditions  such as global warming  may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in some parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures 
our models may be based on data and assumptions that do not accurately account for these emerging developments 
similarly  the likelihood or potential severity of insured losses from an outbreak of a pandemic disease  such as the avian influenza a virus hn  is uncertain and may not be appropriately reflected in our models 
while to date outbreaks of the avian flu continue to occur among poultry or wild birds in a number of countries in asia  parts of europe  and recently in africa  transmission to humans has been rare to date 
if the virus mutates to a form that can be transmitted from human to human  it has the potential to spread rapidly worldwide 
the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated hn virus that can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative 
if we fail to appropriately model  price for  and contractually address exposures for risks such as these  or others to which we may be exposed  our financial results may be adversely impacted  perhaps significantly 
because we depend on a few insurance and reinsurance brokers in our reinsurance segment and a few program managers in our individual risk segment for a large portion of revenue  loss of business provided by them could adversely affect us 
our reinsurance business markets insurance and reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
in recent years  we have experienced increased concentration of production from a smaller number of intermediaries 
four brokerage firms accounted for of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  subsidiaries and affiliates of the benfield group limited  marsh inc  the willis group and aon corporation accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written in the loss of a substantial portion of the business provided by these brokers would have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products could decline as a result of any loss of the business provided by these brokers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease 
our individual risk business markets a significant portion of its insurance and reinsurance products through program managers 
in recent years  we have experienced increased concentration of production from a smaller number of intermediaries 
program managers account for of our individual risk segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  the loss of a substantial portion of the business provided by these program managers would have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products could decline as a result of any loss of the business provided by these program managers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease 
our reliance on reinsurance brokers exposes us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured 
table of contents a portion of their liabilities with us we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers 
likewise  premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers  who then pass such amounts on to us 
in many jurisdictions  if a broker were to fail to make such a payment to a ceding insurer  we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in many jurisdictions  when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid by the cedants and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  in connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances  we assume a substantial degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world 
retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms 
as part of our risk management  we buy reinsurance for our own account 
this type of insurance when purchased to protect reinsurance companies is known as retrocessional reinsurance 
our primary insurance companies also buy reinsurance from third parties 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining reinsurance 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms as favorable to us as in the past 
this could limit the amount of business we are willing to write  or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events 
when we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance for our own account  the insolvency  inability or reluctance of any of our reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 
generally  we believe that the willingness to pay of some reinsurers and retrocessionaires is declining  and that the overall industry ability to pay has also declined due to the adverse results of and and other factors 
this risk is more significant to us at present than at most times in the past given the substantial retrocessional claims to which we are entitled following the recent large catastrophe loss events of and at december   we had recorded million of reinsurance recoverables  net of a valuation allowance of million for uncollectible recoverables 
a comparably large portion of the reinsurance recoverables is concentrated with a relatively small number of reinsurers 
we could be adversely impacted by us government authority investigations arising from our restatement of our financial statements  or from a failure to comply with the terms of the company s settlement agreement with the sec 
over the last several years  the sec  the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the nyag  the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york  and other government authorities have been scrutinizing and investigating a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
we received a subpoena from the sec in february  a subpoena from the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the nyag in march  and a subpoena from the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york in june  each of which related to the industry wide investigations into non traditional  or loss mitigation  re insurance products 
the subpoenas from the sec and the united states attorney s office also related to our business practice review and to our determination to restate our financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and in addition  we understand that certain of our customers or reinsurers were asked to provide documents and information with respect to contracts to which we are a party in the framework of the ongoing industry wide investigations 
on february   we announced that the sec had accepted our offer of settlement to resolve the sec s investigation 
we consented  without admitting or denying any wrongdoing  to entry of a final judgment enjoining future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws  and to pay disgorgement of and a civil penalty of million 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement  we have also retained an independent consultant to review certain of our internal controls  policies and procedures as well as the design and implementation of the review conducted by independent counsel reporting to the non executive members of our board of directors and certain additional procedures performed by our auditors in connection with their audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  the 
table of contents amount of the monetary penalty discussed above was provided for in on march   the court signed the final judgment approving our settlement with the sec 
while we will strive to fully comply with the settlement agreement with the sec  it is possible that the enforcement staff of the sec and or the independent consultant may take issue with our cooperation despite our efforts 
any such failure to comply with the settlement agreement or any such perception that we have failed to comply  could adversely affect us  perhaps materially so 
in september  the sec filed an enforcement action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against james n 
stanard  our former chairman and chief executive officer  martin j 
merritt  our former controller  and michael w 
cash  a former officer of renaissancere  charging messrs 
stanard  merritt and cash with violations of federal securities laws  including securities fraud  and seeks permanent injunctive relief  disgorgement of ill gotten gains  if any  plus prejudgment interest  civil money penalties  and orders barring each defendant from acting as an officer or director of any public company 
see legal proceedings for additional information 
this ongoing matter could give rise to additional costs  distractions  or impacts to our reputation 
it is possible that the ongoing investigation into our former officers could give rise to additional investigations or proceedings being commenced against us and or our current or former senior executives in connection with these matters  which could be criminal or civil 
emerging claim and coverage issues  or other litigation  could adversely affect us 
unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect us  perhaps materially so 
for example  we could be subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent  or to increases in the number or size of claims to which we are subject 
with respect to our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some time after their occurrence 
for example  we could be deemed liable for losses arising out of a matter  such as the potential for industry losses arising out of an avian flu pandemic  that we had not anticipated or had attempted to contractually exclude 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance and reinsurance contract and policy wordings 
alternatively  potential efforts by us to exclude such exposures could  if successful  reduce the market s acceptance of our related products 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
our exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our long tail casualty businesses grow  because in these lines claims can typically be made for many years  making them more susceptible to these trends than our traditional catastrophe business  which is typically more short tail 
in addition  we could be adversely affected by the growing trend of plaintiffs targeting participants in the property liability insurance industry in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling and other practices 
although we are seeking to add professional staff and systems to improve our contracts and claims capabilities  we may fail to mitigate our exposure to these growing uncertainties 
the loss of key senior members of management could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers 
in particular  we believe we have been substantially dependent upon the services of our senior members of management  who include our co founder and current chief executive officer and president  the presidents of renaissance reinsurance and renaissancere ventures ltd  each of whom has served with us for more than ten years  and the chief executive officer of glencoe group 
as announced in may  the former president of renaissancere  william riker  retired from his position at the end of  though he will remain as an employee of the company serving in an advisory capacity until august while we do not believe that mr 
riker s transition will have an adverse impact on our business  we may be unable to foresee  or mitigate  all of the potential impacts of mr 
riker s departure 
in addition  the loss of services of other members of senior management in the future  and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team  may strain our ability to execute our growth initiatives 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers  including but not limited to mr 
riker and the persons named above  could adversely impact our business  by  for example  making it more difficult to 
table of contents retain clients or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing executives 
in general  the loss of the services of any members of our current senior management team may adversely affect our business  perhaps materially so 
in addition  our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and service personnel 
the location of our global headquarters in bermuda may impede our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of permanent residents certificates and holders of working residents certificates may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a valid government work permit 
a work permit may be granted or renewed upon showing that  after proper public advertisement  no bermudian  spouse of a bermudian  or holder of a permanent residents certificate or working residents certificate who meets the minimum standards reasonably required by the employer has applied for the job 
substantially all of our officers are working in bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next three years 
the bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits  which would adversely impact us 
in addition  a bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions only for key employees 
a work permit is issued with an expiry date up to five years and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or  if issued  renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term 
if any of our senior executive officers were not permitted to remain in bermuda  our operations could be disrupted and our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result 
us taxing authorities could contend that one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries are subject to us corporate income tax  as a result of changes in law or regulations  or otherwise 
if the us internal revenue service the irs were to contend successfully that renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe  rihl  rimco or top layer re is engaged in a trade or business in the us  renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe  rihl  rimco or top layer re would  to the extent not exempted from tax by the us bermuda income tax treaty  be subject to us corporate income tax on that portion of its net income treated as effectively connected with a us trade or business  as well as the us corporate branch profits tax 
although we would vigorously resist such a contention  if we were ultimately held to be subject to taxation  our earnings would correspondingly decline 
in addition  benefits of the us bermuda income tax treaty which may limit any such tax to income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe  rihl  rimco or top layer re in the us are only available to any of renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe  rihl  rimco or top layer re if more than of its shares are beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by individuals who are bermuda residents or us citizens or residents 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe  rihl  rimco or top layer re may not be able to continually satisfy such beneficial ownership test or be able to establish it to the satisfaction of the irs 
finally  it should be noted that it is unclear whether the income tax treaty assuming satisfaction of the beneficial ownership test applies to income other than premium income  such as investment income 
congress has recently conducted hearings relating to the tax treatment of offshore insurance and is reported to be considering legislation that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally 
one such proposal would increase the excise tax rate on reinsurance premiums paid to affiliated foreign reinsurers from to  another proposal would limit deductions for premiums ceded to affiliated non us companies above certain levels 
other proposals relating to cross border transactions  intangible products  or non us jurisdictions generally have been introduced in a number of congressional committees 
enactment of some versions of such legislation  depending on the specific details  could adversely affect our financial results 
regulatory challenges in the us or elsewhere to our bermuda operations claims of exemption from insurance regulation could restrict our ability to operate  increase our costs  or otherwise adversely impact us 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except bermuda 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci and top layer re each conduct business only from 
table of contents their principal offices in bermuda and do not maintain an office in the us the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
moreover  we could be put at a competitive disadvantage in the future with respect to competitors that are licensed and admitted in us jurisdictions 
among other things  jurisdictions in the us do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted 
our contracts generally require us to post a letter of credit or provide other security after a reinsured reports a claim 
in order to post these letters of credit  issuing banks generally require collateral 
it is possible that the european union or other countries might adopt a similar regime in the future  or that us rules could be altered in a way that treats bermuda disproportionately 
any such development could adversely affect us 
glencoe and lantana are currently eligible  non admitted excess and surplus lines insurers in  respectively  and states and territories of the us and are each subject to certain regulatory and reporting requirements of these states 
however  neither glencoe nor lantana is admitted or licensed in any us jurisdiction  moreover  glencoe only conducts business from bermuda 
accordingly  the scope of glencoe s and lantana s activities in the us is limited  which could adversely affect their ability to compete 
in addition  stonington  which writes insurance in all states and the district of columbia on an admitted basis  is subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which confer regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors  and relates to such matters as rate setting  policy forms  limitations on dividends and transactions with affiliates  solvency standards which must be met and maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the examination of the affairs of insurance companies  which includes periodic market conduct examinations by the regulatory authorities  annual and other reports  prepared on a statutory accounting basis  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with these requirements  and could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
we plan to grow stonington s business and  accordingly  expect our absolute and relative regulatory burden to increase 
our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our subsidiaries to become subject to additional regulation in other jurisdictions 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  information technology failures  or external events 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
as our business and operations grow more complex we are exposed to more risk in these areas 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented disaster recovery and other business contingency plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls  information technology and application systems  but internal controls provide only 
table of contents reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
a portion of our premium is written in currencies other than the us dollar and a portion of our claims and claim expense reserves is also in non dollar currencies 
moreover  we maintain a portion of our cash and investments in currencies other than the us dollar 
although we generally seek to hedge significant non us dollar positions  we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting solely from fluctuations in the values of these foreign currencies  which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease 
in addition  failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results of operations to be more volatile 
a decline in our investment performance could reduce our profitability and hinder our ability to pay claims promptly in accordance with our strategy 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets  in amounts which have increased in recent years driven by factors including the increased size of our invested assets 
as a result  our financial results increasingly depend on the performance of our investment portfolio  which contains  among other things  fixed maturity securities  such as bonds and mortgage backed securities 
our operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency risk  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
additionally  with respect to certain of our investments  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk 
as our invested assets have grown substantially in recent years and have come to effect a comparably greater contribution to our financial results  a failure to successfully execute our investment strategy could have a material adverse effect on our overall results 
in the event of a significant or total loss in our investment portfolio  the company s ability to pay any claims promptly in accordance with our strategy could be adversely affected 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates 
as a result of large reinsurance or insurance losses  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease  perhaps substantially 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could reduce our investment yield  which would reduce our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity 
in recent years we have allocated a portion of our portfolio to other investments which have different risk characteristics than our traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investment portfolios 
these other investments include private equity partnerships  hedge fund investments  a fund that invests in senior secured bank loans  a european high yield credit fund and catastrophe bonds 
also included in other investments are investments in a medium term note  representing an interest in a pool of european fixed income securities  a non us dollar convertible fund and miscellaneous other investments 
the performance of these other investments had a positive impact on the performance of our investment portfolio from through  and accordingly if we decreased our relative allocation to these investments it could reduce the returns on our portfolio  adversely affecting our overall profitability 
these other investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of certain of these investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of the investments 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our other investments are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes of the investments 
many of the investments are subject to 
table of contents restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
we are unable to precisely quantify these risks as we do not have timely access to the securities underlying each investment 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
given our reliance on external investment managers  we could also be exposed to the operational risks  for example  but not limited to  technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans of our investment managers 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis 
the capital requirements of our business depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to sell our reinsurance and insurance products is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to support our future operating requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
any further equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
our ability to raise such capital successfully would depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including our financial position and operating results  market conditions  and applicable legal issues 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital if and when needed  our business  results of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the covenants in our debt agreements limit our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have incurred indebtedness  and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
at december   we had an aggregate of million of indebtedness outstanding  consisting of million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  a million bank loan incurred and fully drawn by our consolidated subsidiary  davincire  and million outstanding on a revolving credit facility used in our weather trading activities 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain letter of credit facilities in connection with their insurance and reinsurance business 
the largest of these is a secured letter of credit facility established under a reimbursement agreement entered into by certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates 
the obligations of each of our subsidiaries and affiliates party to the reimbursement agreement are secured by redeemable preference shares of rihl 
such subsidiaries and affiliates have the option to  and under certain circumstances may be required to  post alternative forms of collateral 
the facility currently is in the amount of billion 
we have the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase the size of the facility to billion 
at february   the aggregate face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the reimbursement agreement with effective dates on or before december  was million and total letters of credit outstanding under all facilities was  million 
in addition  we maintain a committed revolving credit facility  currently in the amount of million 
we have the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase the size of the facility to million 
no advances were outstanding under this facility at december  the agreements covering our indebtedness  particularly our bank loans  contain covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
these agreements also require us to maintain specific financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders under our credit facilities could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them  cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit  or both  and require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral 

table of contents by july  we are obligated to repay in full the million of outstanding principal of our senior notes due we may not succeed in refinancing this obligation on terms as attractive to us or at all  particularly in light of the current dislocation in the global credit markets 
while we currently have sufficient cash to repay the senior notes in full  we could be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain debt financing in the future in amounts or on terms as attractive to us as in the past 
because we are a holding company  we are dependent on dividends and payments from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no direct operations  we rely on investment income  cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the holding company does not have any operations and from time to time may not have significant liquid assets 
if our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us  we may be unable to pay dividends or to repay our indebtedness 
bermuda law and regulations require our subsidiaries which are registered in bermuda as insurers to maintain a minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio  and prohibit dividends that would result in a breach of these requirements 
further  renaissance reinsurance and davinci  as class insurers in bermuda  may not pay dividends which would exceed of their respective capital and surplus  unless they first make filings confirming that they meet the required margins 
our class insurers  including glencoe  lantana and top layer re  may not declare or pay dividends during any financial year that would cause that insurer as the case may be to fail to meet its minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio 
generally  our us insurance subsidiaries may only pay dividends out of earned surplus 
further  the amount payable without the prior approval of the applicable state insurance department is generally limited to the greater of of policyholders surplus or statutory capital  or of the subsidiary s prior year statutory net income 
since our us insurance subsidiaries earned surplus is negative  these subsidiaries cannot currently pay dividends without the applicable state insurance department approval 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
some provisions of our amended and restated bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute or more of any class or series of our shares 
the primary purpose of this restriction is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of the internal revenue code for us federal tax purposes 
however  this limit may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of common shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for a classified board  whose size is fixed and whose members may be removed by the shareholders only for cause upon a vote  restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors  submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and requisition special general meetings  a large number of authorized but unissued shares which may be issued by the board without further shareholder action  and a shareholder vote to amend  repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the bye laws 
these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these 
table of contents bye law provisions could prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares 
we indirectly own stonington  stonington lloyds  newstead and inverness 
our ownership of a us insurance company such as these can  under applicable state insurance company laws and regulations  delay or impede a change of control of renaissancere 
under applicable state insurance regulations  any proposed purchase of or more of our voting securities would require the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulatory authorities 
it is possible that we will form  acquire or invest in other us domestic insurance companies in the future  which could make this risk more severe 
under applicable state insurance regulations  any proposed purchase of or more of our voting securities would require the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulatory authorities 
investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the us we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the us all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the us investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the us on our directors and officers who reside outside the us or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the us to receive service of process 
developments in the sub prime mortgage securities market could adversely affect the company s financial results 
credit markets and sub prime residential mortgage markets  particularly in the us but also worldwide  have recently experienced severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions see item business investments exposure to sub prime 
these and other related events have had a significant impact on the capital markets associated not only with sub prime mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  but also with credit and financial markets as a whole 
these developments have the potential to adversely affect the company  including in the following ways our casualty clash book of business  within the specialty unit of our reinsurance segment  has exposure to sub prime losses through the d o and e o market  for which our current estimate of these losses at december  is million 
it is possible our current reserve is not sufficient to cover our existing exposures  or that new developments will give rise to additional exposures we have not currently identified 
our surety book of our specialty reinsurance portfolio is also exposed to risks relating to a decrease in home demand  which could lead to delays and defaults in projects  although we currently do not believe we have sub prime related losses within this book of business 
the company s investment in channelre has been adversely affected by channelre s direct exposure to sub prime mortgages in its reinsurance portfolio 
channelre has also guaranteed certain collateralized debt obligations that include sub prime mortgage collateral 
the company s investment in aladdin may be adversely affected by aladdin s direct exposure to sub prime through credit derivatives and credit protection on fixed income securities 
aladdin s business is to accept exposure to credit markets and thus its results of operations  and our equity pick up  will fluctuate significantly based on credit markets 
while our investment guidelines and or standing orders prohibit our fixed income investment managers from investing in securities supported by sub prime collateral  require that all securitized assets in our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments be aaa rated  and prohibit investments in cdos  clos and home equity loans as well fixed income investments where the credit rating is backed by a financial guaranty company  it is possible that one or more of our managers has breached our guidelines  or that our guidelines have not been sufficient to mitigate all of the risks that may arise out of the developments arising 
table of contents from the sub prime dislocation 
with respect to our hedge fund investments  our hedge fund managers independently direct and control the underlying investments of such funds managers  and it is possible we may be more exposed than we have estimated  or that such exposure may increase in future periods 
within our private equity portfolio we have exposure to sub prime through underlying portfolio investments  such as financial institutions  which have been impacted by sub prime  although we estimate that these underlying portfolio investments are immaterial to our private equity portfolio as a whole 
while our current positions in sub prime within our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale is nil  and we believe our exposure within our hedge fund and private equity portfolio is limited  we may amend our investment guidelines in future periods and or may elect to assume exposure to this and other more risky asset classes if we believe we are being paid appropriately to assume this additional risk 
the company s ability to raise capital or refinance existing credit facilities on favorable terms in the future could be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit and financial markets 
see business exposure to sub prime 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we frequently monitor and analyze opportunities to acquire or make a strategic investment in new or other businesses that will not detract from our core reinsurance and individual risk operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
any failure by us to effectively limit such risks or implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our industry the reinsurance business is historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline  which could affect our profitability 
the reinsurance and insurance industries have historically been cyclical  characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing prices 
reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in their results of operations due to numerous factors  including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events  perceptions of risk  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers 
all of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance and insurance industries 
for example  in the past couple of years  recent factors such as the increase of capital in our industry since the catastrophic events and the florida legislation described above  have helped create a softening market where pricing has decreased in certain lines and become less attractive 
as noted  changes in the pricing environment may result from changes in the perception of risk following large industry loss events 
in particular  the catastrophe exposed lines in which we are a market leader are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions  and acts of terrorism  such as hurricane katrina and the world trade center disaster 
the occurrence  or nonoccurrence  of catastrophic events  the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable  affects both industry results and consequently prevailing market prices of our products 
we expect premium rates and other terms and conditions of trade to vary in the future 
if demand for our products falls or the supply of competing capacity rises  we  due in part to our disciplined approach to underwriting  might expect our growth to be adversely affected  and our profitability could be affected as well 
in particular  we might lose existing customers or decline business  which we might not regain when industry conditions improve 

table of contents in addition  a substantial amount of capital has entered the insurance and reinsurance markets both through investments in established companies and through start up ventures as described above 
hedge funds and investment banks have been increasingly active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks 
generally  we expect this trend to increase over time 
it is possible that such new or alternative capital in or affecting the market could cause further reductions in prices of our products 
to the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our hurdle rate  we would plan to reduce our future underwriting activities thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings 
heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry may adversely affect our business 
we believe that the sec  the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the nyag  the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york  and other government authorities are continuing to scrutinize and investigate a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
for example  in  state officials from jurisdictions including florida  ohio  connecticut and texas initiated new complaints or announced settled actions relating to issues including allegations of bid rigging  collusion  allocation of customers and other improper conduct 
we have not been named in any such action or proceeding 
however  it is possible such scrutiny could expand to include us in the future  and it is also possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
we cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations  and any changes in industry practice  including future legislation or regulations that may become applicable to us  will have on the insurance industry  the regulatory framework  or our business 
because we frequently assume the credit risk of the brokers with whom we do business throughout our insurance and reinsurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected if the credit quality of these brokers is severely impacted by the current investigations in the insurance industry or by changes to broker industry practices 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and us insurers and property catastrophe reinsurers  including other bermuda based reinsurers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
market participants continue to raise and accumulate new capital  thereby strengthening their ability to compete 
in addition  alternative sources of competitive capital  including hedge funds and investment banks  are increasing the overall capacity in the industry 
increased capacity levels in our industry generally have led to increased competition  and decreased prices for our products 
we believe that our principal competitors in the property catastrophe reinsurance market include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace  everest re  ipc  partner re  transatlantic  validus and xl along with other relatively new bermuda reinsurers with whom we compete  such as allied world  arch  axis  endurance  montpelier re and platinum 
we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as aig  berkshire  munich re group and swiss re 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
following hurricane katrina in august  a significant number of new reinsurance companies were formed in bermuda which have resulted in new competition  which may well continue in subsequent periods 
there has been substantial new capital contributed to these new bermuda based reinsurance enterprises 
in addition  we believe existing reinsurance companies raised significant new capital subsequent to hurricane katrina to rebuild their capital position and to capitalize on new opportunities 
also  hedge funds and investment banks have shown an increasing interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance companies  or through the use of other financial products  such as catastrophe bonds and other cat linked securities 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the reinsurance market or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 

table of contents we also continue to experience a degree of competition from alternative products of capital market participants that are intended to compete with reinsurance products and which could impact the demand for traditional catastrophe reinsurance 
we believe activity in this sector has recently increased and may continue to increase 
we cannot predict what effect any of these developments may have on our businesses 
the businesses in which our individual risk unit operates are also highly competitive 
primary insurers compete on the basis of factors including distribution channels  product  price  service and financial strength 
many of our primary insurance competitors are larger and more established than we are and have greater financial resources and consumer recognition 
we seek primary insurance pricing that will result in adequate returns on the capital allocated to our primary insurance business 
we may lose primary insurance business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices or on more advantageous terms 
consolidation in the insurance industry could adversely impact us 
we believe that many insurance industry participants are seeking to consolidate 
these consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business 
as the insurance industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
in addition  insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated  larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance 
the number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline 
reinsurance intermediaries could also consolidate  potentially adversely impacting our ability to access business and distribute our products 
we could also experience more robust competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business or our results of operation 
recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products in florida and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in january  the state of florida enacted legislation known as bill no 
cs hb a the bill  which increased the access of primary florida insurers to the fhcf 
through the fhcf  the state of florida currently provides below market rate reinsurance of up to billion per season  an increase from the previous cap of billion  with the state able to further increase the limits up to an additional billion per season 
in addition  the legislation allows florida insurers to choose a lower retention level for fhcf reinsurance coverage  at specified rates for specified layers of coverage 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of citizens  a state sponsored entity  to compete with private insurance and reinsurance companies  such as ours  by  for example  authorizing citizens to write multi peril policies in high risk account coverage areas 
moreover  the legislation mandated the reduction of citizens in force rates by an average of  repealed a rate increase that was to be effective march   and froze any additional rate increases for the remainder of also  citizens premium rates are no longer required to be non competitive with the voluntary  private market and are no longer required to be based on the highest rate offered by the top insurers in a given area 
in sum  the legislation reduced the role of the private markets in providing support for florida based risks  a market in which we have established substantial market share 
while we have sought and intend to continue to seek to utilize our strong relationships  record of superior service and financial strength to mitigate the impact of the legislation  we believe cs hb a caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written in as compared to because of our position as one of the largest providers of catastrophe exposed coverage  both on a global basis and in respect of the florida market  the bill may have had a disproportionate adverse impact on us compared to other market participants 
while proposals have been introduced in florida to reduce the expansion of the fhcf introduced in  there can be no assurance that any such legislation will be passed  or that additional legislation reducing the size of the private markets relating to florida will not be enacted 

table of contents it is also possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on the florida precedent  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the federal level 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of the fhcf  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the florida market  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
other political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the us and individual state governments as well as an increasing number of international authorities 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders 
increasingly  governmental authorities in both the us and worldwide seem to us to be interested in the potential risks posed by the reinsurance industry as a whole  and to commercial and financial systems in general 
while we do not believe these inquiries have identified meaningful new risks posed by the reinsurance industry  and we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future 
for example  the us federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that will alter and likely increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
moreover  the naic  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia and state insurance regulators  regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
for example  we could be adversely affected by proposals to provide insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  such as the legislation enacted in florida in early described above  require our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations  expand the scope of coverage under existing policies for matters such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  and the new orleans flood  or such as a pandemic flu outbreak  increasingly mandate the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  or disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another 
the growth of our primary insurance business  which is regulated more comprehensively than reinsurance  increases our exposure to adverse political  judicial and legal developments 
we are incorporated in bermuda and are therefore subject to changes in bermuda law and regulation that may have an adverse impact on our operations  including imposition of tax liability or increased regulatory supervision or change in regulation 
in addition  we are subject to changes in the political environment in bermuda  which could make it difficult to operate in  or attract talent to  bermuda 
the bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including in the united states and in various states within the united states 
we are unable to predict the future impact on our operations of changes in the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject 
moreover  our exposure to potential regulatory initiatives could be heightened by the fact that our principal operating companies are domiciled in  and operate exclusively from  bermuda 
for example  bermuda  a small jurisdiction  may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with larger jurisdictions such as the us or the leading european union countries 
in addition  bermuda  which is currently an overseas territory of the united kingdom  may consider changes to its relationship with the united kingdom in the future 
these changes could adversely affect bermuda s position in respect of its regulatory initiatives  which could adversely impact us commercially 

table of contents the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income 
the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june and november via a global forum  bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
regulatory regimes and changes to accounting rules may adversely impact financial results irrespective of business operations 
accounting standards and regulatory changes may require modifications to our accounting principles  both prospectively and for prior periods and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
in particular  the sec and the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  are considering whether gaap will ultimately be replaced by or harmonized with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
it is also possible that the adoption of ifrs would be extended to us issuers on either an optional or mandatory basis 
any such change could have a significant impact on our financial reporting  impacting key matters such as our loss reserving policies and premium and expense recognition 
for example  ifrs is considering adopting an accounting standard that would require all reinsurance and insurance contracts to be accounted for under a new measurement basis  current exit value  which is considered to be closely related to fair value 
we cannot currently assess how the fasb and sec staff s ultimate resolution of these initiatives will impact us  including as respects our loss reserving policy or the effect it might have on recognizing premium revenue and policy acquisition costs 
until final guidance is issued  we intend to apply existing gaap 
there can be no certainty  however  that the sec or the fasb will not require us to modify our current principles  either on a going forward basis or for prior periods 
any required modification of our existing principles  either with respect to these issues or other issues in the future  could have an impact on our results of operations  including changing the timing of the recognition of underwriting income  increasing the volatility of our reported earnings and changing our overall financial statement presentation

it is possible that the ongoing investigation into our former officers could give rise to additional investigations or proceedings being commenced against us and or our current or former senior executives in connection with these matters  which could be criminal or civil 
while we intend to continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigations  we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these ongoing matters or the ultimate impact these investigations may have on our business  including as to our senior management team 
beginning in july  several putative class actions were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in respect of us 
in december  these actions were consolidated and  in february  the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint  purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased and or acquired our publicly traded securities between april  and july  the consolidated amended complaint  which was amended in december  named as defendants  in addition to us  certain of our former officers messrs 
stanard  riker  lummis  cash and merritt and alleged that we and the other named defendants violated the us federal securities laws by making material misstatements and failing to state material facts about its business and financial condition in  among other things  sec filings and public statements 
on april   we executed a stipulation of settlement in which we agreed to settle the claims alleged in the consolidated amended complaint  as amended 
pursuant to the terms of the stipulation  we did not make any admission of liability  and we continue to deny any and all liability in connection with the allegations of the consolidated amended complaint  as amended 
after hearing the plaintiff s motion for final approval of the settlement on january   the court granted final approval of the settlement on january  and determined that the settlement was fair  reasonable and adequate and that the claims against the company and other defendants should be dismissed with prejudice 
an order and final judgment approving the settlement was entered by the court on january  the total amount to be paid in settlement of the claims is million 
a portion of this amount is expected to be offset by insurance recoveries 
these amounts have been provided for in our financial statements 
the settlement provides for the full release of all parties  including us and certain of our present and former directors and officers  including without limitation the defendants who were named in the suits 
our operating subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages 
generally  our primary insurance operations are subject to greater frequency and diversity of claims and claims related litigation and  in some jurisdictions  may be subject to direct actions by allegedly injured persons or entities seeking damages from policyholders 
these lawsuits  involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business  are considered in its loss and loss expense reserves which are discussed in its loss reserves discussion 
in addition to claims litigation  we and our subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies 
this category of business litigation may involve allegations of underwriting or claims handling errors or misconduct  employment claims  regulatory activity or disputes arising from our business ventures 
any such litigation or arbitration contains an element of uncertainty  and we believe the inherent uncertainty in such matters may have increased recently and will likely continue to increase

table of contents overview renaissancere  established in bermuda in to write principally property catastrophe reinsurance  is today a leading global provider of reinsurance and insurance 
through our operating subsidiaries  we seek to obtain a portfolio of reinsurance  insurance and financial risks in each of our businesses that are significantly better than the market average and produce an attractive return on equity 
we accomplish this by taking advantage of market dislocations  and leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management 
overall  our strategy focuses on superior risk selection  capital management  marketing and joint ventures 
we provide value to our clients and joint venture partners in the form of financial security  innovative products  and responsive service 
we are known as a leader in paying valid reinsurance claims promptly 
we principally measure our financial success through long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus accumulated dividends  which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our company s performance  and believe we have delivered superior performance in respect of this measure in the past 
since a substantial portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverages we offer to clients affected by these events 
we are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover 
accordingly  we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and that our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year  based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world 
our revenues are principally derived from three sources net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell  net investment income and realized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell  and other income received from our joint ventures and various other items 
our expenses primarily consist of net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell  acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write  operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses  rent and other operating expenses  corporate expenses which include certain executive  legal and consulting expenses  costs for research and development  and other miscellaneous costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company  minority interest  which represents the interest of third parties with respect to the net income loss of davincire  and interest and dividend costs related to our debt  preference shares and subordinated obligation to our capital trust 
we are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
the operating results  also known as the underwriting results  of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio  underwriting expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses acquisition expenses and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio below generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
a combined ratio over generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
we also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on an accident year basis 
this ratio is calculated by taking net claims and claim expenses  excluding development on net claims and claim expenses from events that took place in prior fiscal years  divided by net premiums earned 

table of contents we conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
those segments are more fully described as follows reinsurance our reinsurance segment has three main units property catastrophe reinsurance  written for our own account and for davinci  is our traditional core business 
we believe we are one of the world s leading providers of this coverage  based on managed catastrophe gross premiums written 
this coverage protects against large natural catastrophes  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and tsunamis  as well as claims arising from other natural and man made catastrophes such as winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  wind storms  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism 
we offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis 
this means that we begin paying when our customers claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount 
specialty reinsurance  written for our own account and for davinci  covering certain targeted classes of business where we believe we have a sound basis for underwriting and pricing the risk that we assume 
our portfolio in included various classes of business  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice  casualty clash  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  certain casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance that we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we believe that we are seen as a market leader in certain of these classes of business  such as casualty clash  surety  catastrophe exposed workers compensation and terrorism 
through ventures  we pursue joint ventures and other strategic relationships 
our three principal business activities in this area are property catastrophe joint ventures which we manage  such as top layer re  davinci and starbound ii  strategic investments in other market participants  such as our investments in channelre and platinum  where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we partner with other market participants  weather related activities such as fee based consulting services  research and development and loss and mitigation activities 
only business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  our share of the results of top layer re  channelre  starbound ii  tower hill  platinum and our weather related activities are included in the other category of our segment results 
individual risk we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts include insurance contracts and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and multi peril crop insurance  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 
our individual risk business is primarily produced through three distribution channels program managers where we write primary insurance through specialized program managers  who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide related back office functions  quota share reinsurance where we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers who  similar to our program managers  provide most of the back office and support functions  and brokers where we write primary insurance produced through licensed intermediaries on a risk by risk basis 
our individual risk business is written by the glencoe group through its principal operating subsidiaries glencoe and lantana  which write on an excess and surplus lines basis  and through stonington and stonington lloyds  which write on an admitted basis 
as noted above  in our individual risk business  we 
table of contents substantially rely on third parties for services including the generation of premium  the issuance of policies and the processing of claims 
we actively oversee our third party partners through an operations review team at glencoe specialty services  which conducts initial due diligence as well as ongoing monitoring 
new business in addition to the potential growth of our existing reinsurance and insurance businesses  from time to time we consider opportunistic diversification into new ventures  either through organic growth  the formation of new joint ventures  or the acquisition of other companies or books of business of other companies 
this potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted  additional classes of risk exposed business  both directly for our own account and through possible new joint venture opportunities 
we also regularly evaluate opportunities to grow our business by utilizing our skills  capabilities  proprietary technology and relationships to expand into further risk related coverages  services and products 
generally  we focus on underwriting or trading risks where reasonably sufficient data may be available  and where our analytical abilities may provide us a competitive advantage  in order for us to seek to model estimated probabilities of losses and returns in accordance with our approach in respect of our current portfolio of risks 
in evaluating potential new ventures  we seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core reinsurance and individual risk operations 
accordingly  we regularly review strategic opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that our ability to potentially attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources  and by the capabilities and track record of our ventures unit 
summary of critical accounting estimates claims and claim expense reserves general description we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 

table of contents the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million  increased our net income by million and reduced our net loss by million  respectively 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
our claims and claim expense reserves are reviewed annually by an external actuarial firm 
the actuarial firm performs this work for the purpose of issuing an actuarial opinion on the reasonableness of the claims and claim expense reserves for each of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the actuarial opinions are required to meet various insurance regulatory requirements 
the actuarial firm discusses its conclusions with management and presents its findings to the audit committee of the board of directors of the company 
although we do not explicitly rely on the work performed by the actuarial firm for estimating our reserves for claims and claim expenses  we compare our recorded claims and claim expense reserves to those estimated by the actuarial firm to determine whether our estimates are within the actuarial firm s reasonable range of estimates 
to date  our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves have been within the actuarial firm s reasonable range of estimates 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker 
table of contents notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and is subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  the sub prime related casualty net claims and claim expenses are based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
during  we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimates of these losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from our clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in particular  due to the size and unusual complexity of certain legal and claims issues  particularly but not exclusively relating to hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  our loss estimates 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
following is a discussion of the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units 
reinsurance segment property catastrophe reinsurance within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit  we principally write property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts to insure insurance and reinsurance companies against natural and man made catastrophes 
under these contracts  we indemnify an insurer or reinsurer when its aggregate paid claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in the contract  up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
our coverages are offered on either a worldwide basis or are limited to selected geographic areas 

table of contents coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
we also enter into retrocessional contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
this coverage is generally in the form of excess of loss retrocessional contracts and may cover all perils and exposures on a worldwide basis or be limited in scope to selected geographic areas  perils and or exposures 
the exposures we assume from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant may alter their book of business after the retrocessional coverage has been bound 
we also offer dual trigger reinsurance contracts which require us to pay claims based on claims incurred by insurers and reinsurers in addition to the estimate of insured industry losses as reported by referenced statistical reporting agencies 
our property catastrophe reinsurance business is generally characterized by loss events of low frequency and high severity 
initial reporting of paid and incurred claims in general  tends to be relatively prompt 
we consider this business short tail as compared to the reporting of claims for long tail products  which tends to be slower 
however  the timing of claims payment and reporting also varies depending on various factors  including whether the claims arise under reinsurance of primary insurance companies or reinsurance of other reinsurance companies  the nature of the events eg  hurricanes  earthquakes or terrorism  the geographic area involved  post event inflation which may cause the cost to repair damaged property to increase significantly from current estimates  or for property claims to remain open for a longer period of time  due to limitations on the supply of building materials  labor and other resources  and the quality of each client s claims management and reserving practices 
management s judgments regarding these factors are reflected in our claims reserve estimates 
reserving for substantially all of our property catastrophe reinsurance business does not involve the use of traditional actuarial techniques 
rather  claims and claim expense reserves are estimated by management after a catastrophe occurs by completing an in depth analysis of the individual contracts which may potentially be impacted by the catastrophic event 
the in depth analysis generally involves estimating the size of insured industry losses from the catastrophic event  reviewing our portfolio of reinsurance contracts to identify those contracts which are exposed to the catastrophic event  reviewing information reported by clients and brokers  discussing the event with our clients and brokers  and estimating the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs arising from the catastrophic event on a contract by contract basis and in aggregate for the event 
once an event has occurred  during the then current reporting period we record our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims arising from the event 
our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves is then determined by deducting cumulative paid losses from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event and our estimate of ibnr is determined by deducting cumulative paid losses  case reserves and additional case reserves from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event 
once we receive a notice of loss or payment request under a catastrophe reinsurance contract  we are generally able to process and pay such claims promptly 
because the events from which claims arise under policies written by our property catastrophe reinsurance business are typically prominent  public occurrences such as hurricanes and earthquakes  we are often able to use independent reports as part of our loss reserve estimation process 
we also review catastrophe bulletins published by various statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining the size of the industry loss  although these reports may not be available for some time after an event 
in addition to the loss information and estimates communicated by cedants and brokers  we also use industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
the information stored in our rems modeling system enables us to analyze each of our policies in relation to a loss and compare our estimate of the loss with those reported by our policyholders 
the rems modeling system also allows us to compare and analyze individual losses reported by policyholders affected by the same loss event 
although the rems modeling system assists with the analysis of the underlying loss and provides us with the information and ability to perform increased analysis  the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims and the unique characteristics of each loss 
for smaller events including localized severe weather events such as windstorms  hail  ice  snow  flooding  freezing and tornadoes  which are not necessarily prominent  public occurrences  we initially place greater reliance on catastrophe bulletins published by statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining what events occurred during the reporting period than we do for large events 
this includes reviewing 
table of contents catastrophe bulletins published by property claim services for us catastrophes 
we set our initial estimates of reserves for claims and claim expenses for these smaller events based on a combination of our historical market share for these types of losses and the estimate of the total insured industry property losses as reported by statistical reporting agencies  although we generally make significant adjustments based on our current exposure to the geographic region involved as well as the size of the loss and the peril involved 
this approach supplements our approach for estimating losses for larger catastrophes  which as discussed above  includes discussions with brokers and ceding companies  reviewing individual contracts impacted by the event  and modeling the loss in our rems system 
in general  our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves for our more recent reinsured catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater potential variability  and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients 
as our property catastrophe reinsurance claims age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as seen in the actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis table below  of our inception to date claims and claim expenses in our property catastrophe reinsurance unit were incurred in the and accident years  due principally to the losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan  jeanne  katrina  rita and wilma 
due to the size and complexity of the losses in these accident years  there still remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate settlement costs associated with these accident years 
within our property catastrophe reinsurance business  we seek to review substantially all of our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
our quarterly review procedures include identifying events that have occurred up to the latest balance sheet date  determining our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs associated with those new events which have arisen during the reporting period  and reviewing the ultimate expected cost to settle claims and administrative costs associated with those events which occurred during previous periods 
this process is judgmental in that it involves reviewing changes in paid and reported losses each period and adjusting our estimates of the ultimate expected losses for each event if there are developments that are different from our previous expectations 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our property catastrophe reinsurance unit increased our net income by million  decreased our net income by million and reduced our net loss by million  respectively 
actual results vs 
initial estimates the table below summarizes our initial assumptions and changes in those assumptions for claims and claim expense reserves within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
as discussed above  the key assumption in estimating reserves for our property catastrophe reinsurance unit is our estimate of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table shows our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses for each accident year and how these initial estimates have developed over time 
the initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses represents our estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims incurred from catastrophic events occurring during a particular accident year  and as reported as of december of that year 
the re estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december   and  represent our revised estimates as reported as of those dates 
the cumulative favorable adverse development shows how our most recent estimates as reported at december  differ from our initial accident year estimates 
favorable development implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while adverse development implies that our current estimates are higher than our original estimates 
total reserves as of december  reflect the unpaid portion of our estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table is presented on a gross basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries 
it also does not consider the impact of loss related premium or davincire minority interest 

table of contents actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis in thousands  except percentages accident year initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses re estimated claims and claim expenses as of december  cumulative favorable adverse development decrease increase of current ultimate claims and claim expense reserves as of december  of claims and claim expenses unpaid as of december  as quantified in the table above  since the inception of the company in we have experienced million of cumulative favorable development on the run off of our gross reserves within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
this represents of our inception to date gross claims and claim expenses of billion and is calculated based on our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves as of december   compared to our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses  as of the end of each accident year 
as described above  given the complexity in reserving for claims and claims expenses associated with catastrophe losses for property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts  we have experienced development  both favorable and unfavorable  in any given accident year in amounts that exceed our inception to date percentage of 
for example  our accident year developed favorably by million  which is better than our initial estimates of claims and claim expenses for the accident year as estimated as of december   while our accident year developed unfavorably by million  or 
on a net basis our cumulative favorable or unfavorable development is generally reduced by offsetting changes in our reinsurance recoverables  as well as changes to loss related premiums such as reinstatement premiums  and minority interest for changes in claims and claim expenses that impact davincire  all of which generally move in the opposite direction to changes in our ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the percentage of claims unpaid at december  for each accident year reflects both the speed at which claims and claim expenses for each accident year have been paid and our estimate of claims and claim expenses for that accident year 
as seen above  claims and claim expenses for the accident year have to date been paid quickly compared to prior accident years 
this is due to the fact that hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne which occurred in have been rapid claims paying events 
this is driven in part by the mix of our business in florida  which primarily includes property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance for personal lines property coverage  rather than commercial property coverage or retrocessional coverage  and the speed of the settlement and payment of claims by our underlying cedants 
in contrast  our accident year  which includes losses from the events of september   and our accident year  which includes significant losses from hurricane katrina  includes a higher mix of commercial business where the underlying claims of our cedants tend to be settled and paid more slowly 
in addition  claims from our underlying cedants for the and accident years are subject to more complex coverage and legal matters due to the complexity of the catastrophic events taking place in those years 

table of contents sensitivity analysis the table below shows the impact on our ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity as of and for the year ended december  of reasonably likely changes to our estimates of ultimate losses for claims and claim expenses incurred from catastrophic events within our property catastrophe reinsurance business unit 
the reasonably likely changes are based on an historical analysis of the period to period variability of our ultimate costs to settle claims from catastrophic events  giving due consideration to changes in our reserving practices over time 
in general  our claim reserves for our more recent catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater variability and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients 
as our claim reserves age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as a result  the sensitivity analysis below is based on the age of each accident year  our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses for the catastrophic events occurring in each accident year  and the reasonably likely variability of our current estimates of claims and claim expenses by accident year 
the impact on net income and shareholders equity assumes no increase or decrease in reinsurance recoveries  loss related premium or davincire minority interest 
property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve sensitivity analysis in thousands  except percentages ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december  impact of change in ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december  impact of change in ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december  impact of change on net income for the year ended december  impact of change on shareholders equity as of december  higher recorded lower we believe the changes we made to our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses represent reasonably likely outcomes 
while we believe these are reasonably likely outcomes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  the sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes in our underlying assumptions 
it is possible that our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses could be significantly higher or lower than the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events for which we have not estimated claims and claim expenses or for exposures we do not currently believe are covered under our policies 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
specialty reinsurance within our specialty reinsurance business unit we write a number of reinsurance lines such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice  casualty clash  property per risk  catastrophe exposed personal lines property and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our property catastrophe reinsurance products  and we also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance or pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products to insurance companies and other reinsurance companies and provide coverage for specific geographic regions or on a worldwide basis 
we expanded our specialty reinsurance business in and have increased our presence in the specialty reinsurance market since that time 

table of contents our specialty reinsurance business can generally be characterized as providing coverage for low frequency and high severity losses  similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance business 
as with our property catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance contracts frequently provide coverage for relatively large limits or exposures 
as a result of the foregoing  our specialty reinsurance business is subject to significant claims volatility 
in periods of low claims frequency or severity  our results will generally be favorably impacted while in periods of high claims frequency or severity our results will generally be negatively impacted 
our processes and methodologies in respect of loss estimation for the coverages we offer through our specialty reinsurance operation differ from those used for our property catastrophe oriented coverages 
for example  our specialty reinsurance coverages are more likely to be impacted by factors such as long term inflation and changes in the social and legal environment  which we believe gives rise to greater uncertainty in our claims reserves 
moreover  in reserving for our specialty reinsurance coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
we believe this makes our specialty reinsurance reserving subject to greater uncertainty than our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
when initially developing our reserving techniques for our specialty reinsurance coverages  we considered estimating reserves utilizing several actuarial techniques such as paid and incurred development methods 
we elected to use the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique because this method is appropriate for lines of business  such as our specialty reinsurance business  where there is a lack of historical claims experience 
this method allows for greater weight to be applied to expected results in periods where little or no actual experience is available  and  hence  is less susceptible to the potential pitfall of being excessively swayed by one year or one quarter of actual paid and or reported loss data 
this method uses initial expected loss ratio expectations to the extent that losses are not paid or reported  and it assumes that past experience is not fully representative of the future 
as the company s reserves for claims and claim expenses age  and actual claims experience becomes available  this method places less weight on expected experience and places more weight on actual experience 
we reevaluate our actuarial reserving techniques on a periodic basis 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique requires us to estimate an expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an expected loss reporting pattern 
we select our estimates of the expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the terms of the coverages we offer 
the estimated expected claims and claim expense ratio may be modified to the extent that reported losses at a given point in time differ from what would be expected based on the selected loss reporting pattern 
our estimate of ibnr is the product of the premium we have earned  the initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and the percentage of estimated unreported losses 
in addition  certain of our specialty reinsurance coverages may be impacted by natural and man made catastrophes 
we estimate claim reserves for these losses after the event giving rise to these losses occur  following a process that is similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance unit described above 
within our specialty reinsurance business  we seek to review substantially all of our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
typically  our quarterly review procedures include reviewing paid and reported claims in the most recent reporting period  reviewing the development of paid and reported claims from prior periods  and reviewing our overall experience by underwriting year and in the aggregate 
we monitor our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting assumptions on a quarterly basis and compare them to our actual experience 
these actuarial assumptions are generally reviewed annually  based on input from our actuaries  underwriters  claims personnel and finance professionals  although adjustments may be made more frequently if needed 
assumption changes are made to adjust for changes in the pricing and terms of coverage we provide  changes in industry standards  as well as our actual experience  to the extent we have enough data to rely on our own experience 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our specialty reinsurance unit increased our net income by million  increased our net income by million and reduced our net loss by million  respectively 

table of contents actual results vs 
initial estimates the actual vs 
initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio table below summarizes our key actuarial assumptions in reserving for our specialty reinsurance business 
as noted above  the key actuarial assumptions include the estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and the estimated loss reporting patterns 
the table shows our initial estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio by underwriting year 
the table shows how our initial estimates of these ratios have developed over time  with the re estimated ratios reflecting a combination of the amount and timing of paid and reported losses compared to our initial estimates 
the initial estimate is based on the actuarial assumptions that were in place at the end of that year 
a decrease in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while an increase in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are higher than our initial estimates 
the result would be a corresponding favorable impact on shareholders equity and net income or a corresponding unfavorable impact on shareholders equity and net income  respectively 
the table also shows how our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed from one underwriting year to the next 
the table below reflects a summary of the weighted average assumptions for all classes of business written within our specialty reinsurance unit 
the table is presented on a gross loss basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries or loss related premium 
actual vs 
initial estimated specialty reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses ratio underwriting year initial estimate re estimate as of december  december  december  the table above shows that our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios for attritional losses for each new underwriting year within our specialty reinsurance unit have stayed relatively constant between and from and this reflects the fact that management has not made significant changes to its initial estimates of expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios from one underwriting year to the next 
the principal reason for the modest changes from one underwriting year to the next is that the mix of business has changed 
for example  the mix of business for the underwriting year has a lower initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio than in prior years as it is more heavily weighted to business that is expected to produce a lower level of losses 
the decrease in the initial estimated expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio from to reflects assumption changes made for certain classes of business where our experience  and the industry experience in general  has been better than expected and  as a result  we decreased our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for these classes of business 
as each underwriting year has developed  our re estimated expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed 
in particular  our re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have decreased significantly from the initial estimates for the through underwriting years 
this was principally due to our reserve review  discussed below 
during our reserve review  we further segmented the specialty business with the aim of grouping risks into more homogeneous categories which respond to the evolution of actual exposures 
this became possible as the volume of this business increased over the three preceding years 
this further segmentation required the selection of loss reporting patterns to be applied to these new groups 
we also updated our assumptions for our original loss reporting patterns based on a combination of new industry information and actual experience accumulated over the three preceding years 
the assumptions for the new loss reporting patterns were applied to all prior underwriting years 
in addition  we made explicit allowances for commuted contracts whereas previously these were considered in the overall reserving assumptions 
we also reviewed substantially all of our case 
table of contents reserves and additional case reserves 
the result of the foregoing was a decrease in our specialty reinsurance re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense reserves in subsequent to this reserve review  the specialty book of business has generally continued to perform better than expected 
this includes favorable development within the underwriting year as actual paid and reported losses during have been less than expected  which has resulted in a reduction in our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for this year 
however  there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
for example  the underwriting year has performed worse than expected and our current estimates are significantly higher than our initial estimates 
this is due in part to the losses associated with sub prime exposure in our casualty clash line of business 
as noted above  our specialty reinsurance business is characterized by events of low frequency and high severity which results in actual experience that can be significantly better or worse than long term trends or industry standards may imply 
as noted above  some of our specialty reinsurance contracts are exposed to net claims and claim expenses from large natural and man made catastrophes 
net claims and claim expenses from these large catastrophes are reserved for after the events which gave rise to the claims in a manner which is consistent with our property catastrophe reinsurance reserving practices as discussed above 
the large catastrophes occurring during the period from to principally include hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which occurred in our estimate of ultimate net claims and claim expenses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma within our specialty reinsurance unit  net of reinsurance recoveries and assumed and ceded loss related premium  totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively

the table quantifies reasonably likely changes in our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and estimated loss reporting patterns 
the changes to the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios represent percentage increases or decreases to our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios 
the change to the reporting patterns represent claims reporting that is both faster and slower than our current estimated claims reporting patterns 
the impact on net income and shareholders equity assumes no increase or decrease in reinsurance recoveries  loss related premium or davincire minority interest

while we believe these are reasonably likely changes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  we caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes 
it is possible that our initial estimated claims and claim expense ratios and loss reporting patterns could be significantly different from the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events which we have not estimated reserves for or for exposures we do not currently think are covered under our contracts 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to reserves for claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts include insurance contracts and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and multi peril crop insurance  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 
we expanded our individual risk operations in and started writing a significant amount of this business in that year 
we use the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique to estimate claims and claim expenses within our individual risk segment

this reflects the fact that management has not made significant changes to its estimated initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio from one period to the next 
the principal reason for the changes from one year to the next is that the mix of business has changed 
as each accident year has developed  our re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have generally been reduced 
this reflects the impact of actual experience in our individual risk business where actual paid and reported losses to date for attritional losses are less than originally expected

reserve reviews we announced in early that during we would review the processes and assumptions for establishing and evaluating our reserves during starting in and  we significantly expanded our specialty reinsurance and individual risk businesses  respectively  which resulted in significant growth in our reserves for claims and claim expenses for these lines of business over the subsequent three years 
when establishing our initial reserves for these lines of business  we placed significant reliance on industry data as we did not have the benefit of our own historical experience 
prior to  we started experiencing favorable development on the run off of our reserves 
this favorable development was principally due to our specialty reinsurance and individual risk businesses performing better than historical industry averages and paid and reported claims developing better than expected in our property catastrophe reinsurance business 
we elected to perform our reserve reviews in principally due to the growth in our businesses and reserves for claims and claim expenses  an increase in then recent periods in favorable development in reserves for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk businesses  which had performed more favorably in what was effectively their first several years of operations than historical industry data would have anticipated  recent favorable development with respect to our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves  and a determination to consider enhancements to our reserving processes and assumptions 
we completed reviews of our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves  specialty reinsurance reserves and individual risk reserves in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these reviews  we reduced prior year reserves within our reinsurance and individual risk segments by million and million  respectively 
within our reinsurance segment  the decrease included a million decrease in reserves for our property catastrophe reinsurance business and a million decrease in reserves for our specialty reinsurance business 
after adjusting for the impact of minority interest in davinci  our net loss was reduced by million as a result of these reviews 
within our reinsurance segment  we experienced a decrease in our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves for claims and claim expenses principally due to re estimating the ultimate expected cost for both small and large catastrophes 
this was due to a reassessment of our reserves for claims and claim expenses in light of historical paid loss trends and reported loss activity for these catastrophes 
in coming to this conclusion  we reviewed claims files  requested updated claims information from brokers  and developed some new tools to help us assess trends in paid and reported losses 
as a result of this review  we determined that there were trends of paid and reported claims for these catastrophes that were coming in less than originally expected and therefore the ultimate expected losses for these catastrophes were decreased 
the reviews also included a reassessment of our actuarial techniques and assumptions for our specialty reinsurance business 
we considered whether we should continue with the use of the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method in reserving for our specialty reinsurance business or whether a different actuarial method might be more appropriate 
as a result of the review  we determined it was appropriate to continue with the use of the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method 
to enhance the reserving for our specialty reinsurance business  we further segmented this business during the review with the aim of grouping risks into more homogeneous categories which respond to the evolution of actual exposures 
this became possible as the volume of this business increased over the three preceding years 
this further segmentation required the selection of loss reporting patterns to be applied to these new groups 
we also updated our assumptions for our original loss reporting patterns based on a combination of new industry information and actual experience accumulated over the three preceding years 
the assumptions for the new loss reporting patterns were applied to all prior underwriting years 
in addition  we made explicit allowances for commuted contracts whereas previously these were considered in the overall reserving assumptions 
we also reviewed substantially all of our case reserves and additional case reserves 
the result of the foregoing was a decrease in our specialty reinsurance reserves for claims and claim expenses 

table of contents the reserve review for our individual risk business followed a similar process to the specialty reinsurance review noted above 
the changes within our individual risk segment as a result of the reserve review were insignificant 
losses recoverable we enter into reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related assumed reinsurance 
for multi year retrospectively rated contracts  we accrue amounts either assets or liabilities that are due to or from assuming companies based on estimated contract experience 
if we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
the estimate of losses recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading claims and claim expense reserves above 
in particular  losses recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance  industry losses reported by various statistical reporting services  and other factors 
losses recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the ultimate amount of insured losses for the industry as a whole that will be reported by the applicable statistical reporting agency  as per the contract terms 
in addition  the level of our additional case reserves and ibnr reserves has a significant impact on losses recoverable 
these factors can impact the amount and timing of the losses recoverable to be recorded 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future 
the amounts recoverable ultimately collected are open to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims  for reasons including insolvency and elective run off  contractual dispute and various other reasons 
in addition  because the majority of the balances recoverable will not be collected for some time  economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may change  and these changes may affect the reinsurer s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
to reflect these uncertainties  we estimate and record a valuation allowance for potential uncollectible losses recoverable which reduces losses recoverable and net earnings 
we estimate our valuation allowance by applying specific percentages against each recovery based on our counterparty s credit rating 
the percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates 
we also apply case specific valuation allowances against certain recoveries that we deem unlikely to be collected in full 
we then evaluate the overall adequacy of the valuation allowance based on other qualitative and judgmental factors 
the valuation allowance recorded against losses recoverable was million at december  million  with the decrease principally driven by the payment of claims in as well as the write off of balances previously provided for in the valuation allowance 
the reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for  and  respectively  of our losses recoverable balance at december   and  respectively 
the three largest company specific components of the valuation allowance represented  and of our total valuation allowance at december   and fair value measurements the use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses  is pervasive within our financial statements  and is a critical accounting policy and estimate for us 
fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date 
we recognize the change in unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value in our statements of operation  with the exception of changes in unrealized gains and losses on our fixed maturity investments available for sale  which are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
we do not apply hedge accounting 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas clarifies that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets level i and the lowest priority being unobservable data level iii 
further  fas requires tabular disclosures of the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy 
while fas was not effective for us until january   we believe that the categorization of our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into the fas hierarchy is a useful way to highlight the level of management judgment involved in determining fair value 
the following table summarizes all of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of december  by fas hierarchy at december  total quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level in thousands assets fixed maturity investments available for sale short term investments other investments other secured assets other assets liabilities other liabilities fair values determined by level inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices available to the company from active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
the fair value is determined by multiplying the quoted price by the quantity held by us p x q 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals  broker quotes and certain pricing indices 
level inputs are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
in these cases  significant management assumptions can be used to establish management s best estimate of the assumptions used by other market participants in determining the fair value of the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
premiums we recognize premiums as revenue over the terms of the related contracts and policies 
our written premiums are based on policy and contract terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies 
the information received is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications and or discussions with ceding companies or their broker 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of written premium including adjustment and reinstatement premium  earned premium  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
we generally recognize premium on the date the contract is bound  even if the contract provides for an effective date prior to the date the contract is bound  thus preventing premature revenue recognition 
the date the contract is bound is usually the date we are on risk for the policy and this is generally the date on which the reinsurance slip is signed 
the signing of the reinsurance contract normally occurs after the date the slip is signed 

table of contents we book premiums on non proportional contracts in accordance with the contract terms 
premiums written on losses occurring contracts are typically earned over the contract period 
premiums on risks attaching contracts are either estimated or earned as reported by the cedants  which may be over a period more than twice as long as the contract period 
for multi year policies  only the initial annual premium is included as written at policy inception 
the remaining annual premiums are included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
management is required to make estimates based on judgment and historical experience for periods during which information has not yet been received 
in our individual risk business  it is often necessary to estimate portions of premiums written from quota share contracts and by program managers and the related commission expense 
management estimates these amounts based on discussions with ceding companies and program managers  together with historical experience and judgment 
total premiums written estimated in our individual risk business at december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and total estimated premiums earned were million  million and million  respectively 
total earned commissions estimated at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
management tracks the actual premium received and commissions incurred and compares this to the estimates previously booked 
such estimates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods when actual figures are recorded 
to date such subsequent adjustments have not been material 
since premiums for our reinsurance segment are contractually driven and the reporting lag for such premiums is minimal  estimates for premiums written for this segment are usually not significant 
the minimum and deposit premiums on excess policies are usually set forth in the language of the contract and are used to record premiums on these policies 
actual premiums are determined in subsequent periods based on actual exposures and any adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
reinstatement premiums are estimated after the occurrence of a significant loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses and case reserves reported in the period 
reinstatement premiums are earned when written 
ceded premiums are also recognized on the date the contract is bound and are deducted from gross premiums written  to arrive at net premiums written 
ceded premiums are earned over the terms of the related contracts and policies  and are reflected as a reduction to gross premiums earned to arrive at net premiums earned 
income taxes income taxes have been provided in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  on those operations which are subject to income tax 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
such temporary differences are primarily due to the tax basis discount on unpaid losses and loss expenses  foreign tax credits  deferred policy acquisition costs  net operating loss carryforwards  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   our net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were million nil and million million  respectively see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 
in and  we generated taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries which was offset by the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward 
during  our valuation allowance was reassessed and we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will continue to generate taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries and therefore be able to recover a substantial portion of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance from million at december  to million at 
table of contents december   resulting in a corresponding increase to net income and resulting in the negative income tax provision in as a result  we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to increase in the future  as our us operations expand 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are likely to differ from actual experience

the three most significant items impacting our financial performance on a comparative basis to include higher premium volume an increase in our net premiums earned  principally due to growth in gross premiums written in our catastrophe reinsurance unit where we found pricing and terms more favorable in compared with and we chose to write more business in that unit in  declining claims a significant decrease in net claims and claim expenses as a result of light insured catastrophe loss activity for  our net claims and claims expenses were significantly impacted by hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma in  and losses of that magnitude did not occur in  and higher net investment income a significant increase in net investment income due to higher average invested assets due to the generation of cash flow from operations during the last three years that have been invested in our investment portfolio  combined with higher average yields on our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments 
our financial performance was negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which occurred in the third and fourth quarters of and resulted in an million net negative impact 
our financial performance was also impacted by million of expenses related to our internal review and ongoing investigations into the company and certain of its present and former executive officers by governmental authorities  including severance and other costs relating to the departure of our former chairman and chief executive officer 
in addition  was impacted by several other large natural catastrophes including hurricanes dennis and emily  european windstorm erwin as well as flooding in several european cities 
total insured losses from the catastrophes are estimated to be the most costly on record for a single year 
as one of the largest writers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the 
table of contents world  our financial results are negatively impacted  and materially so  when there are large insured catastrophe losses 
finally  our financial performance benefited by the million net favorable impact as a result of our reserve reviews completed in the net negative impact from the hurricanes described above includes the sum of net claims and claim expenses incurred  assumed and ceded reinstatement premiums earned  lost profit commissions  assessment related losses and expenses  and minority interest 
net negative impact is based on management s estimates following a review of our potential exposures and discussions with our counterparties 
given the magnitude of these events  delays in receiving claims data  uncertainty surrounding final industry losses reported by statistical reporting agencies which impact our reinsurance recoveries  the unusual legal and claim issues related to certain of the events  particularly but not exclusively hurricane katrina  and other uncertainties inherent in loss estimation  meaningful additional uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry from these events 
accordingly  these estimates are subject to change as new or revised data is received from our counterparties  and other factors 
changes to these estimates will be recorded in the periods in which they occur 
underwriting results by segment we conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk

table of contents for  our gross premiums written in our reinsurance segment decreased by million to  million primarily due to softening market conditions in where the pricing for property catastrophe reinsurance decreased from in addition  we believe that legislation passed in florida in early  expanding the size of its state funded reinsurance and insurance facilities  caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in private industry property catastrophe gross premiums written in as compared to as discussed in more detail below  in we entered into a large transaction in our specialty reinsurance unit that resulted in million of gross premium written 
in the absence of this contract  the company s reinsurance segment gross premiums written would have decreased further  compared to the company does not currently expect this contract to renew in its existing form 
gross premiums written in our reinsurance segment increased by million to  million in  compared to  primarily due to the favorable pricing and terms experienced during our catastrophe reinsurance renewals 
the improved pricing and terms for our catastrophe reinsurance renewals was principally driven by a hardening property catastrophe reinsurance market following the large catastrophes occurring during in  we also wrote million of gross premiums on behalf of two new fully collateralized joint ventures which were established to take advantage of the favorable pricing and terms discussed above 
the increase in our catastrophe gross premiums written more than offset a significant decline in our specialty reinsurance premium in for  our gross premiums written in our reinsurance segment increased by million to  million 
the increase consisted primarily of premiums written which we view as loss related and attributable to the large catastrophes occurring during this loss related premium  which includes reinstatement premiums written as a result of large catastrophes hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  back up reinsurance coverage provided to companies to replace reinsurance protection lost following a large catastrophe  and reinsurance coverage provided to a company to cover named hurricanes  totaled million in gross premiums written by geographic region the following is a summary of our gross reinsurance premiums written  excluding premiums assumed from our individual risk segment  allocated to the territory of coverage exposure reinsurance segment gross premiums written year ended december  gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written in thousands  except percentages property catastrophe reinsurance united states and caribbean europe worldwide excluding u

table of contents our property catastrophe reinsurance gross premiums written continues to be characterized by a large percentage of us and caribbean premium  as we have found business derived from exposures in europe or the rest of the world to be  in general  less attractive on a risk adjusted basis during recent periods 
a significant amount of our us and caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms  mainly us atlantic hurricanes  as well as earthquakes and other natural and man made catastrophes 
ceded premiums written year ended december  in thousands ceded premiums written reinsurance segment due to the potential volatility of the property catastrophe reinsurance contracts which we sell  we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
we use our rems modeling system to evaluate how each purchase interacts with our portfolio of reinsurance contracts we write  and with the other ceded reinsurance contracts we purchase  to determine the appropriateness of the pricing of each contract and whether or not it helps us to balance our portfolio of risks 
ceded premiums written decreased by million in  primarily as a result of the company s decreased utilization of fully collateralized joint ventures during in  the company assumed million of catastrophe reinsurance premium which was fully ceded to its fully collateralized joint ventures  primarily starbound ii  compared to  where million of assumed catastrophe reinsurance premium was fully ceded to starbound re and tim re 
the decrease in premium ceded to fully collateralized joint ventures was due to a decrease in demand for these vehicles in compared to ceded premiums written increased by million in primarily as a result of the utilization in the us hurricane season of two fully collateralized joint ventures  starbound re and tim re  pursuant to which million of assumed catastrophe reinsurance premium was fully ceded to those entities 
in  ceded premiums written included million of premiums written which we view as loss related and attributable to the large hurricanes 
this includes additional premium ceded on certain multi year retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts which was triggered as a result of hurricanes katrina and wilma 
excluding this loss related premium  ceded premiums written decreased by million in  compared to to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the impact of large losses on our financial results and to manage our portfolio of risk  however  the buying of ceded reinsurance in our reinsurance segment is opportunistic and is not based on placing a specific reinsurance program each year 
in addition  in future periods we may utilize the growing market for cat linked securities to expand our ceded reinsurance buying if we find the pricing and terms of such coverages attractive 
reinsurance segment underwriting results in  we generated underwriting income of million and recorded a net claims and claim expense ratio of  an expense ratio of  and a combined ratio of  compared to million of underwriting income  a net claims and claim expense ratio of  an expense ratio of and a combined ratio of  in the decrease in underwriting income in was principally driven by an increase in net claims and claims expenses which was principally driven by million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses and partially offset by a million increase in favorable development on prior year reserves

table of contents there was an absence of large  land falling hurricanes and other catastrophes impacting the insurance industry in and  which substantially contributed to the significant improvement in our underwriting profits in and  compared to our underwriting results over the last three years have been  and may well continue to be  impacted by prior year reserve development 
our prior year reserves experienced million  million and million of net favorable development in  and  respectively 
the favorable prior year reserve development in was principally attributable to a reduction in our catastrophe unit ultimate losses related to the and accident years  combined with continued lower than expected claims emergence in our specialty unit 
the favorable prior year reserve development in was principally driven by our specialty reinsurance unit 
the reductions in reserves within our specialty reinsurance unit were principally driven by the application of our formulaic reserving methodology for this book of business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves 
in addition  within our specialty reinsurance unit  million of the favorable development in was driven by a reduction in carried reserves due to commutations 
the favorable prior year reserve development in was principally the result of our reserve reviews 
with the growth in our reserves for claims and claim expenses  we announced in early that we would review the processes and assumptions for establishing and evaluating our reserves during we completed reviews of our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance reserves in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these reviews  we reduced prior year reserves within our reinsurance segment by million  which reduced our net claims and claim expense ratio by percentage points 
after adjusting for the impact of minority interest  our net loss was reduced by million as a result of the reinsurance segment reserve reviews 
the reserve changes for our property catastrophe portfolio reflects a reassessment of our reserves for claims and claim expenses in light of historical paid loss trends and reported loss activity for the to accident years 
for our specialty reinsurance business  the changes were principally due to a reassessment of our estimated loss reporting patterns 
since establishing the specialty reinsurance business unit in  reported claim activity has been less than expected and therefore we have adjusted our estimated loss reporting patterns to reflect this experience 
the following financial data shows the net financial statement impact on our reinsurance segment as a result of the large hurricanes and reserve reviews reinsurance segment net negative positive financial statement impact year ended december  net claims and claim expenses other minority interest total ratio incurred in thousands  except percentages hurricanes hurricane katrina hurricane wilma hurricane rita subtotal hurricanes reserve reviews catastrophe reserve review specialty reserve review subtotal reserve reviews net negative positive financial statement impact other primarily consists of assumed and ceded earned reinstatement premiums and lost profit commissions 

table of contents losses from our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance policies can be infrequent  but severe  as demonstrated by our results compared to and during periods with low levels of property catastrophe loss activity  such as and  we have the potential to produce a low level of losses and a related increase in underwriting income 
as described above  we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that have the potential to make landfall in the us  potentially as a result of decadal ocean water temperature cyclical trends  a longer term trend towards global warming  or both or other factors 
given the magnitude of the hurricane losses from and due to delays in receiving claims data and the likelihood of receiving new or revised data from our counterparties  the estimates of hurricane losses and related recoveries are likely to change  perhaps materially 
changes in these estimates will be recorded in the periods in which they occur 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of the costs to acquire premiums and are principally comprised of broker commissions and excise taxes 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums and  accordingly  these costs will normally move in line with the fluctuation in gross premiums earned 
in  the acquisition expense ratio of was slightly higher than the recorded in  driven mainly by higher acquisition costs on one large transaction in our specialty reinsurance unit 
in  the acquisition expense ratio was 
operating expenses consist of salaries and other general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses decreased by million to million in when compared to  principally due to the company reviewing and updating its methodology for allocating certain operating expenses combined with an increase in fee income as discussed below 
our operating expense ratio may increase over time  as a result of factors including the absolute and comparative growth of our operating expenses  further refinements to internal expense allocations  and market trends and dynamics 
we have entered into joint ventures and specialized quota share cessions of our book of business 
in accordance with the joint venture and quota share agreements  we are entitled to certain fee income and profit commissions 
we record these fees and profit commissions as a reduction in acquisition and operating expenses and  accordingly  these fees have reduced our underwriting expense ratios 
these fees totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively and resulted in a corresponding decrease to the underwriting expense ratio of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we are entitled to certain fee income and profit commissions from davinci 
because the results of davinci  and its parent davincire  are consolidated in our results of operations  these fees and profit commissions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements and are principally reflected in minority interest

operating expenses consist of compensation and other general and administrative expenses 
our individual risk business operates with a limited number of employees and  accordingly  we currently outsource much of the administration of our individual risk business to program managers and third party administrators 
operating expenses in our individual risk segment increased by million to million in compared to million in  and million in  principally due to the growth in our business over the last several years which has resulted in an increase in operating expenses such as compensation  office expenses and related costs as well as an increase in allocated operating expenses

a large majority of our investments are invested in the fixed income markets and  therefore  our realized holding gains and losses on investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates decline  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our investment portfolio  and as interest rates rise  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our investment portfolio

the company owns a minority economic interest in davincire  however  because the company controls a majority of davincire s outstanding voting rights  the consolidated financial statements of davincire are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
minority interest represents the portion of davincire s earnings owned by third parties for the years ended december   and in and  davincire generated net income which resulted in a minority interest expense to the company 
in  davincire suffered losses which resulted in minority interest income to the company 
our economic ownership interest in davincire at december   and was approximately  and on december   the company  acting in the capacity of an intermediary  purchased the shares of a third party davincire shareholder for million  representing the aggregate book value of the shares as of december  subsequently  on january   the company sold these shares to two existing third party davincire shareholders for million 
at december   the company had a receivable and payable of million and million  respectively  related to this transaction  which are reflected in other assets and other liabilities  respectively 
the company s ownership interest at december  excludes the impact of this transaction 
income tax benefit expense year ended december  in thousands income tax benefit expense we are subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
in and  we generated taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries which was offset by the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward 
during  our valuation allowance was reassessed and we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will continue to generate taxable income in our us tax paying insurance subsidiaries and therefore be able to recover a substantial portion of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance from million at december  to million at december   resulting in a corresponding increase to net income and resulting in the negative income tax provision in the income tax expense in primarily relates to alternative minimum taxes incurred by our us subsidiaries 
we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to increase in the future  as our us operations expand 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial condition renaissancere is a holding company  and we therefore rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to make dividend payments to our preference and common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our bermuda subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under us statutory regulations and bermuda insurance law  which require our bermuda insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
in addition  bermuda regulations require approval from the bma for any reduction of capital in excess of of statutory capital  as defined in the insurance act 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries was billion billion  and the amount of capital and surplus required to be maintained was million million 
during  renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe declared aggregate cash dividends of million  million and nil  respectively  compared with million  nil and nil  respectively  in our principal us insurance subsidiary stonington is also required to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
restrictions with respect to dividends are based on state statutes 
in addition  there are restrictions based on risk based capital tests which is the threshold that constitutes the authorized control level 
if stonington s statutory capital and surplus falls below the authorized control level  the texas department of insurance tdi is authorized to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect policyholders and creditors 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of stonington was million million 
because of an accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington cannot currently pay an ordinary dividend without tdi approval 
in the aggregate  our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
additionally  we maintain a million revolving credit facility to meet additional liquidity and capital requirements 
at december   we have not drawn against this revolving credit facility 
cash flows and liquidity cash flows from operating activities for were million  which principally consisted of our net income of million prior to dividends on preference shares  a million increase in the minority interest in the undistributed net income of davincire and an increase in the undistributed losses of other ventures of million  offset by decreases to reinsurance balances payable of million  and an increase in premiums receivable of million 
our cash flows from operations were primarily used to repurchase our common shares  redeem our series a preference shares and capital securities  and increase our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale 
we have generated cash flows from operations over the three year period significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
because a large portion of the coverages we provide typically can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
in addition  given the severity of losses incurred in from the large catastrophes  many of which remain unpaid at december   it is likely that we will experience a significant amount of paid claims in which could result in us having reduced or negative cash flows from operations 
reserves for claims and claim expenses we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but 
table of contents which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 
the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million  million and reduced our net loss by million  respectively 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
our claims and claim expense reserves are reviewed annually by an external actuarial firm 
the actuarial firm performs this work for the purpose of issuing an actuarial opinion on the reasonableness of the claims and claim expense reserves for each of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the actuarial opinions are required to meet various insurance regulatory requirements 
the actuarial firm discusses its conclusions with management and presents its findings to the audit committee of our board of directors of the company 
although we do not explicitly rely on the work performed by the actuarial firm for estimating our reserves for claims and claim expenses  we compare our recorded claims and claim expense reserves to those estimated by the actuarial firm to determine whether our estimates are within the actuarial firm s reasonable range of estimates 
to date  our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves have been within the actuarial firm s reasonable range of estimates 

table of contents reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and is subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  the sub prime related casualty net claims and claim expenses are based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
during  we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimates of these losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from our clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in particular  due to the size and unusual complexity of certain legal and claims issues  particularly but not exclusively relating to hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  our loss estimates 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
refer to our claims and claim expense reserves critical accounting estimates discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units

pursuant to the terms of the million revolving credit facility maintained by renaissancere  a default by davincire on its obligations will not result in a default under the renaissancere facility 
under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and joint ventures may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
our principal letter of credit facility is a syndicated secured facility which accepts as collateral shares issued by our subsidiary rihl

the outlook on all these companies is stable 
while the ratings of renaissance reinsurance are among the highest in our business  adverse ratings actions could have a negative effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
moreover  if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best  standard poor s  moody s or fitch  we believe our competitive position in the insurance industry would suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings 
we can not give any assurance regarding whether or to what extent the rating agencies may downgrade our ratings 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date  we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation

notwithstanding the foregoing  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
the large majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities 
we also have an allocation to other investments  including hedge funds  private equity partnerships and other investments 
at december   these other investments totaled million or million or of our total investments 
at december   our fixed maturities available for sale and short term investment portfolio had a dollar weighted average credit quality rating of aa aa 
at december   our average yield to maturity on our fixed maturity investments available for sale and our short term investment portfolio was  before investment expenses 
at december   our non investment grade fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million or of our fixed maturity investments available for sale  and at december  our non investment grade fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million or of our total fixed maturity investments available for sale 
in addition  within our other investments category we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities 
at december   the funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities totaled million compared to million at december  we also hold a significant amount of short term investments 
short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased 
short term investments are carried at cost which approximates fair value 
as of december   we had  million of short term investments compared to  million as of december  our target benchmark portfolio for our fixed maturities and short term investments currently has a year duration 
our duration at december  was years years  reflecting our view that the current level of rates affords inadequate compensation for the assumption of additional interest rate risk associated with longer duration 
from time to time  we may reevaluate the duration of our portfolio in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions 

table of contents as with other fixed income investments  the value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in the overall investment market and in overall economic conditions 
additionally  our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments 
examples of some of these risks include changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to prepayment risk on our mortgage backed investments 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
when we receive these prepayments  our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets will likely be at reduced interest rates 
conversely  when interest rates increase  consumers will generally make fewer prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us less quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
this will increase the duration of our portfolio  which is disadvantageous to us in a rising interest rate environment 
our investments in mortgage backed securities are also subject to default risk 
this risk is due in part to defaults on the underlying securitized mortgages  which would decrease the market value of the investment and be disadvantageous to us 
our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations  and our investment portfolio can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads even if specific securities are not downgraded 
our investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment risks  as noted above  and to the structural risks of these securities 
the structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer s overall capital structure 
within our other investments category  we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities as well as securities denominated in foreign currencies 
these investments expose us to losses from insolvencies and other credit related issues 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may result in realized losses to us if our exposures are not hedged or if our hedging strategies are not effective

the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these investments is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
net investment income includes interest income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts and is net of investment management and custody fees 
the amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity investments is computed using the effective yield method 
the fair values of our fixed maturity investments are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or trader bid indications and or internal pricing valuation techniques 
realized gains or losses on the sale of fixed maturity investments are determined using the first in first out cost method and include adjustments to the cost for declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
the company routinely assesses whether declines in the fair value of its fixed maturity investments below cost represent impairments that are considered other than temporary 
there are several factors that are considered in the assessment of impairment of a security  which include i the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost  iii the company s intent and ability to hold the security  iv the potential for the security to recover in value  v an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer and vi an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable

during the year ended december   the company recorded million million  million in other than temporary impairment charges 
the other than temporary impairment charges in  and were due to rising interest rates and our decision to recognize impairment charges for all of our fixed maturity investments available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position at the end of each quarter for the years ending december   and as we do not currently have the intent to hold them until they fully recover in value

these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sale which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our hedge fund and private equity partnership valuations are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
the fair value of catastrophe bonds are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications

the interest on this facility is based on a spread above libor 
we have reflected the interest due in through based upon the current interest rate on the facility 
the private equity commitments and bank loan fund do not have a defined contractual commitment date and we have therefore included them in the less than one year category 
we caution the reader that the information provided above related to estimated future payment dates of our reserves for claims and claim expenses is not prepared or utilized for internal purposes and that we currently do not estimate the future payment dates of claims and claim expenses 
because of the nature of the coverages that we provide  the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our policy liabilities will fluctuate  perhaps significantly  and therefore are highly uncertain 
we have based our estimates of future claim payments upon benchmark indsutry payment patterns  drawing upon available relevant sources of loss and allocated loss adjustment expense development data 
these benchmarks are revised periodically as new trends emerge 
we believe that it is likely that this benchmark data will not be predictive of our future claim payments and that material fluctuations can occur due to the nature of the losses which we insure and the coverages which we provide 
in certain circumstances many of our contractual obligations may be accelerated to dates other than those reflected in the table  due to defaults under the agreements governing those obligations including pursuant to cross default provisions in such agreements or in connection with certain changes in control of the company  if applicable 
in addition  in connection with any such default under the agreement governing these obligations  in certain circumstances these obligations may bear an increased interest rate or be subject to penalties as a result of such a default 

table of contents current outlook market conditions the hurricane season proved to be an active year meteorologically  with the occurrence of two category hurricanes making landfall in north america  as well as a number of smaller windstorms 
however  in terms of insured industry losses  was relatively benign  particularly in the us this is in contrast to  for example  in which hurricane katrina resulted in a record level of insured property losses  and which was also characterized by a large number of other catastrophic insured losses  including hurricanes emily  rita and wilma  european windstorm erwin and flooding in several european cities 
those losses followed an active year in  in which there were four major hurricanes that made landfall in florida 
such losses  together with a number of scientific studies and reports  including reports relating to the possibility of long term climate change  increased the perception of risk held by many industry stakeholders  including rating agencies  ceding companies  and other market participants  which contributed to increased demand for catastrophe exposed insurance and reinsurance during and the affected lines have included catastrophe reinsurance and catastrophe exposed homeowners business  as well as other catastrophe exposed lines of business  such as large account commercial property 
this increased demand  along with improved pricing and policy terms resulted in an increase in new capital within the industry including substantial new company formation  with a significant amount of capital raised to support the affected catastrophe exposed classes of business 
the benign insured catastrophe loss activity in and  combined with the new capital within the industry as noted above  have contributed to a marked increase in competition in catastrophe insurance and reinsurance products 
we currently expect competition to continue to increase in in  these market dynamics and increased overall supply levels unfavorably impacted the non catastrophe lines in which we participate 
we currently expect these trends to continue  and perhaps accelerate  in we currently expect that overall market price reductions in our core lines will be moderate  supported in part by rating agency requirements  increasingly robust risk management tools  and significant industry wide returns of capital 
in addition  we believe that our strong relationships  and track record of superior claims paying and other client service  will enable us to compete for the business we find attractive 
however  it is possible that industry pricing in our core product lines will decrease more rapidly than we anticipate  or that we will encounter more significant competitive barriers than we have in the past 
the market for our catastrophe reinsurance products is generally dynamic and volatile 
the market dynamics noted above  increased or decreased catastrophe loss activity  and changes in the amount of capital in the industry can result in significant changes to the pricing  policy terms and demand for our catastrophe reinsurance contracts over a relatively short period of time 
in addition  changes in state sponsored catastrophe funds such as the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf  or the implementation of new government subsidized or sponsored programs  can dramatically alter market conditions 
we currently expect that gross premiums written in our catastrophe reinsurance unit will decrease by approximately in  compared to our specialty reinsurance premiums are attributable to a small number of large contracts and the amount of specialty premiums can fluctuate significantly between quarters and between years depending upon the number and nature of the transactions which we complete 
we currently expect our gross premiums written in our specialty reinsurance unit to decrease by approximately in  compared to with respect to our individual risk business  we currently expect increased pricing pressures across many of the lines of business we have written in the last several years 
in addition  we believe that we will experience increasing competition for attractive new programs  and for the retention of our current programs  in light of current market dynamics 
we plan to continue our disciplined underwriting approach with respect to both the products which we underwrite and the programs as to which we form partnerships 
while we continuously and actively consider new or expanded relationships  our in depth due diligence process means that growth opportunities within this segment take time  though we do believe we have a dynamic team that responds quickly to these growth opportunities 
we believe that we have established ourselves as an effective and creative  though disciplined  partner  and as a result we are presented with many of the more attractive opportunities to analyze and compete for 
we currently expect that gross premiums written in our individual risk segment will decrease by approximately in  compared to 
table of contents as noted above  we have recently expanded the capabilities of our ventures unit to explore potential strategic investments and other opportunities 
in evaluating such new ventures  we seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities that will not detract from our core operations 
among other things  we currently expect that the recent and continuing dislocation in the capital and credit markets will present potentially attractive investment and operational opportunities  particularly given our strong reputation  financial resources  and the capabilities of our joint ventures

the fair value of these derivatives as recognized in other assets and liabilities in our balance sheet at december   was million nil and million nil  respectively 
during  we recorded losses of million nil in our consolidated statement of operations related to these derivatives 
the fair value of these derivatives are determined using exchange traded closing prices

foreign currency risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience foreign exchange gains and losses and incur underwriting losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our consolidated financial statements 
all changes in exchange rates  with the exception of non us dollar denominated investments classified as available for sale  are recognized currently in our statements of operations 
our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to hold foreign currency assets  including cash  investments and receivables that approximate the foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
when necessary  the company will use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations 
at december   the company had notional exposure of million 
table of contents million related to foreign currency forward and option contracts purchased 
our foreign currency and option contracts are recorded at fair value  which is determined principally by obtaining quotes from independent dealers and counterparties 
during  we incurred a gain of million gain of million  on our foreign currency forward and option contracts related to our underwriting operations 
for our investment operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non us dollar fixed maturity investments  short term investments and other investments 
at december   our combined investment in these non us dollar investments was million million 
to economically hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these investments  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts with net notional exposure of million million 
in the future  we may choose to increase our exposure to non us dollar investments 
unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising from non us dollar investments classified as available for sale are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar available for sale investments  realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar other investments  and foreign exchange gains losses associated with our hedging of these non us dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange gains losses in our statements of operations 
during  we recorded a loss of million loss of million on our foreign currency forward contracts related to hedging our non us dollar investments

equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk due to our investment in a warrant to purchase common shares of platinum  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  as well as to our investments in hedge funds  private equity funds and other investments as described below 
the risk to the platinum warrant is the potential for loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in the price of platinum s common stock 
the aggregate fair value of this investment in platinum was million at december  a hypothetical percent decline in the price of platinum stock  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of the warrant assuming no other changes to the inputs to the black scholes option valuation model that we use 
the decline in the fair value of the warrant would be recorded in other loss income 
we are also indirectly exposed to equity market risk through our investments in some hedge funds that have net long equity positions  private equity partnerships whose exit strategies often depend on the equity markets  such investments totaled million at december  million  and our investments in other ventures  under equity method  which totaled million at december  million 
a hypothetical percent decline in the prices of these hedge funds  private equity partnerships and investments in other ventures  under equity method  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of these investments at december  credit risk our exposure to credit risk is primarily due to our fixed maturity investments available for sale  short term investments  premiums receivable and ceded reinsurance balances 
at december  and  our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa 
from time to time we purchase credit derivatives to hedge our exposures in the insurance industry and to assist in managing the credit risk associated with ceded reinsurance 
at december   the maximum payments we were obligated to make under credit default swaps was million million

the fair value of these credit derivatives as recognized in other liabilities in our balance sheet at december   was a liability of million 
table of contents million 
during  we recorded gains of million losses of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the credit derivatives are determined using industry valuation models 
the fair value of these credit derivatives can change based on a variety of factors including changes in credit spreads  default rates and recovery rates  the correlation of credit risk between the referenced credit and the counterparty  and market rate inputs such as interest rates 
we are exposed to credit risk through our equity investment in channelre  a privately held financial guaranty reinsurance company 
our investment in channelre is subject to potentially significant variability  resulting from mark to market changes  due to changes in credit market conditions 
while the company has no further negative economic exposure to channelre  it is possible that the mark to market will fluctuate  perhaps increasing or decreasing over time  and it is possible that as the underlying securities near maturity  if there are no defaults on the underlying securities for which channelre is obligated  the mark to market adjustment could reverse  perhaps materially 
we are also exposed to credit risk through our equity investment in aladdin  a newly formed aaa rated credit derivatives company that provides credit protection on fixed income securities in return for a premium 
our investment in the aladdin is subject to potentially significant variability  resulting from mark to market changes  due to changes in credit market conditions 
our maximum economic exposure to aladdin at december  is our carrying value which was million 
a decrease in the carrying value of aladdin would negatively impact our results by million 
energy and weather related derivative risk we purchase and sell certain derivative financial products primarily to address weather risks and engage in hedging and trading activities related to these risks 
the trading markets for the instruments in which we participate are generally linked to weather  other natural phenomena  or products or indices linked in part to such phenomena  such as heating and cooling degree days  precipitation  energy production and prices  and commodity prices 
the fair value of these contracts is obtained through the use of quoted market prices  or in the absence of such quoted prices  industry or internal valuation models 
these contracts are recorded on our balance sheet at december   in other assets and other liabilities and totaled million and million  respectively million and million  respectively 
during  the company recorded losses related to these derivatives of million million which are included in other loss income and represents net settlements and changes in the fair value of these contracts 
in addition  we have entered into a credit derivatives agreement with respect to cat linked securities whereby we have sold cat linked securities with a par amount of million to a bank  while retaining the underlying risk 
the agreement allows us to repurchase these securities at par and obligates us to repurchase the securities under certain circumstances including catastrophe triggering events and events of default 
as a result of this transaction  we are receiving the spread over libor for each of the cat link securities subject to the credit derivatives agreement  less a financing fee 
the credit derivatives agreement is accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other loss income 
we recognized million n a of other income in our consolidated statements of operations in from this transaction 
a change decrease in the value of securities underlying the credit derivatives agreement would negatively impact our results by million
