item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us 
our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

table of contents risks related to the sprint nextel merger and the spin off of embarq we may continue to face difficulties in integrating the businesses of nextel  the acquired pcs affiliates or nextel partners with ours 
we continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the nextel wireless network and other wireless technologies with ours  as well as the business practices  operations and support functions of the two companies 
the challenges we are facing and or may face in the future in connection with these integration efforts include the following integrating our cdma and iden wireless networks  which operate on different technology platforms and use different spectrum bands  and developing wireless devices and other products and services that operate seamlessly on both technology platforms  developing and deploying next generation wireless technologies  combining and simplifying diverse product and service offerings  subscriber plans and sales and marketing approaches  preserving subscriber  supplier and other important relationships  consolidating and integrating duplicative facilities and operations  including back office systems  and addressing differences in business cultures  preserving employee morale and attracting and retaining key employees  including in connection with our headquarters consolidation in kansas  while maintaining focus on providing consistent  high quality customer service and meeting our operational and financial goals 
the process of integrating the operations of nextel  the seven acquired pcs affiliates and nextel partners with ours has caused  and may in the future cause  interruptions of  or loss of momentum in  our business and financial performance 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies operations has had  and could continue to have  an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may also incur additional and unforeseen expenses in connection with the integration efforts 
we are subject to exclusivity provisions and other restrictions under our arrangements with the remaining independent pcs affiliates 
continued compliance with those restrictions may limit our ability to fully integrate the operations of nextel and nextel partners in the geographic areas served by those pcs affiliates  and we could incur significant costs to resolve issues related to the merger under these arrangements 
the arrangements with the three independent pcs affiliates restrict our and their ability to own  operate  build or manage specified wireless communication networks or to sell certain wireless services within specified geographic areas 
one of these pcs affiliates has litigation pending against us asserting that actions that we have taken or may take in the future in connection with our integration efforts are inconsistent with our obligations under our agreement with them  particularly with respect to the restrictions noted above 
continued compliance with those restrictions may limit our ability to fully integrate the operations of nextel and nextel partners in the areas served by those pcs affiliates 
we could incur significant costs to resolve these issues 
we are subject to restrictions on acquisitions involving our stock and other stock issuances and possibly other corporate opportunities in order to enable the spin off of embarq to qualify for tax free treatment 
the spin off of embarq cannot qualify for tax free treatment if or more by vote or value of our stock  or the stock of embarq  is acquired or issued as part of a plan  or series of related transactions  that includes the spin off 
because the sprint nextel merger generally is treated as involving the acquisition of of our stock and the stock of embarq for purposes of this analysis  we are subject to restrictions on certain acquisitions using our stock and other issuances of our stock in order to enable the spin off to qualify for tax free treatment 

table of contents these restrictions apply to transactions occurring subsequent to the spin off that are deemed to be part of a plan or series of transactions related to the sprint nextel merger and the embarq spin off 
under applicable tax law  transactions occurring within two years of the spin off are presumed to be pursuant to such a plan unless we can establish the contrary 
at this time  it is not possible to determine how long these restrictions will apply  or whether they will have a material impact on us 
if the spin off of embarq does not qualify as a tax free transaction  tax could be imposed on both our shareholders and us 
we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service  or irs  that the spin off of embarq qualifies for tax free treatment under code sections and in addition  we obtained opinions of counsel from each of cravath  swaine moore llp and paul  weiss  rifkind  wharton garrison llp that the spin off so qualifies 
the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain representations  assumptions and undertakings  including those relating to the past and future conduct of embarq s and our business 
the irs private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualifies for tax free treatment 
the irs could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations  assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated  or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the irs private letter ruling 
if the distribution fails to qualify for tax free treatment  it will be treated as a taxable distribution to our shareholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of embarq s equity securities ie  embarq s common stock issued to our common shareholders received by them 
in addition  we would be required to recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of the embarq equity securities that we distributed on the distribution date plus the fair market value of the senior notes of embarq received by us 
furthermore  subsequent events  some of which are not in our control  could cause us to recognize gain on the distribution 
for example  even minimal acquisitions of our equity securities or embarq s equity securities that are deemed to be part of a plan or a series of related transactions that include the distribution and the sprint nextel merger could cause us to recognize gain on the distribution 
risks related to our business and operations we face intense competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
our operating segments face intense competition 
our ability to compete effectively depends on  among other things  the factors discussed below 
if we are not able to attract and retain customers  our financial performance could be impaired 
our ability to compete successfully for new customers and to retain our existing customers will depend on our marketing and sales  arrangements with mvnos  service delivery and customer care activities  and our credit and collection policies  our ability to anticipate and develop new or enhanced products and services that are attractive to existing or potential customers  and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced by our competitors  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions  and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors 
a key element in the economic success of communications carriers is the ability to retain customers as measured by the rate of subscriber churn 
our ability to retain customers and reduce our rate of churn is affected 
table of contents by a number of factors including  with respect to our wireless business  the actual or perceived quality and coverage of our network  the attractiveness of our handsets and service offerings and the customer care experience  including new account set up and billing 
our ability to retain customers also is affected by competitive pricing pressures and the quality of our customer service 
our recent efforts to reduce churn have not been successful  and our high rate of churn has impaired our ability to maintain the level of revenues generated in prior periods  and caused a deterioration in the operating margins of  our wireless operations and our operations as a whole  the effects of which will continue if we do not reduce our rate of churn 
our ability to retain customers may also be negatively affected by industry trends related to customer contracts 
we and our competitors no longer require customers to renew their contracts when making changes to their pricing plans and have announced that we will be moving to prorated early termination fees 
these changes could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and could lead to an increase in our churn rates if we are not successful in creating a competitive product and service mix 
as the wireless market matures  we must increasingly seek to attract customers from competitors and face increased credit risk from first time wireless subscribers 
we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new customers from each other s existing customer bases rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
recently  we have not been able to attract customers at the same rate as our competitors and have had a net loss of subscribers during in addition  the higher market penetration also means that customers purchasing wireless services for the first time  on average  have a lower credit rating than existing wireless users  and the number of these customers we are willing to accept is dependent on our credit policies  which change from time to time 
to the extent we cannot compete effectively for new customers  our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected 
competition and technological changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our average revenue per user  subscriber churn  our ability to attract new subscribers and operating costs  which would adversely affect our revenues  growth and profitability 
we compete with several other wireless service providers in each of the markets in which we provide wireless services 
as competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we have created pricing plans that have resulted in declining average revenue per minute of use for voice services  a trend which we expect will continue 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact customer retention  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
the wireless communications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology and the deployment of unlicensed spectrum devices 
this change causes uncertainty about future subscriber demand for our wireless services and the prices that we will be able to charge for these services 
rapid change in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies or alternative services that are superior to our technologies or services or that consumers prefer over ours 
if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis  or at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose customers to our competitors 
mergers or other business combinations involving our competitors and new entrants  including mvnos  beginning to offer wireless services may also continue to increase competition 
these wireless operators may be able to offer subscribers network features or products and services not offered by us  coverage in areas not served by either of our wireless networks or pricing plans that are lower than those offered by us  all of which would negatively affect our average revenue per user  subscriber churn  ability to attract new subscribers  and operating costs 
for example  at t  verizon and t mobile now offer competitively priced wireless services packaged with local and long distance voice and high speed internet services  and flat rate voice and data plans  and our boost mobile branded services compete with a number of regional carriers  including metro pcs and leap wireless  which offer competitively priced calling plans that include unlimited local calling 
in addition  we may lose subscribers of our higher priced plans to our boost mobile offerings 

table of contents one of the primary differentiating features of our nextel branded service is the two way walkie talkie service available on our iden network 
a number of wireless equipment vendors  including motorola  which supplies equipment for our nextel branded service  have begun to offer wireless equipment that is capable of providing walkie talkie services that are designed to compete with our walkie talkie services 
several of our competitors have introduced handsets that are capable of providing walkie talkie services 
if these competitors services are perceived to be or become  or if any such services introduced in the future are  comparable to our nextel branded walkie talkie services  a key competitive advantage of our nextel service would be reduced  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
failure to improve wireless subscriber service and failure to continue to enhance the quality and features of our wireless networks and meet capacity requirements of our subscriber base could impair our financial performance and adversely affect our results of operations 
we must continually make investments and incur costs in order to improve our wireless subscriber service and remain competitive 
in connection with our continuing enhancement of the quality of our wireless networks and related services  we maintain and expand the capacity and coverage of our networks  secure sufficient transmitter and receiver sites and obtain zoning and construction approvals or permits at appropriate locations  obtain adequate quantities of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  and related accessories to meet subscriber demand  and obtain additional spectrum in some or all of our markets  if and when necessary 
network enhancements may not occur as scheduled or at the cost that we have estimated 
delays or failure to add network capacity  failure to maintain roaming agreements or increased costs of adding capacity  could limit our ability to satisfy our wireless subscribers  resulting in decreased revenues 
even if we continuously upgrade our wireless networks  there can be no assurance that existing subscribers will not prefer features of our competitors and switch wireless providers 
consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our wireline segment competes with at t  verizon  qwest communications  level communications  and cable operators  as well as a host of smaller competitors  in the provision of wireline services 
some of these companies have built high capacity  ip based fiber optic networks capable of supporting large amounts of voice and data traffic 
these companies claim certain cost structure advantages which  among other factors  may allow them to maintain profitability while offering services at a price below that which we can offer profitably 
increased competition and the significant increase in capacity resulting from new technologies and networks may drive already low prices down further 
at t and verizon  as a result of their acquisitions  continue to be our two largest competitors in the domestic long distance communications market 
we and other long distance carriers depend heavily on local access facilities obtained from ilecs to serve our long distance customers  and payments to ilecs for these facilities are a significant cost of service for our wireline segment 
the long distance operations of at t and verizon have cost and operational advantages with respect to these access facilities because those carriers serve significant geographic areas  including many large urban areas  as the incumbent local carrier 
failure to complete development  testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry 
in addition  the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we develop  test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing 
table of contents those services 
successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend  in part  on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner 
we may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner  and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable  in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology 
deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services 
any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth prospects 
our wireless networks provide services utilizing cdma and iden technologies 
wireless subscribers served by these two technologies represent a smaller portion of global wireless subscribers than the subscribers served by wireless networks that utilize gsm technology 
as a result  our costs with respect to both cdma and iden network equipment and handsets may continue to be higher than the comparable costs incurred by our competitors who use gsm technology  which places us at a competitive disadvantage 
the blurring of the traditional dividing lines between long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contribute to increased competition 
the traditional dividing lines between long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
this trend is also reflected in changes in the regulatory environment that have encouraged competition and the offering of integrated services 
we expect competition to intensify across all of our business segments as a result of the entrance of new competitors or the expansion of services offered by existing competitors  and the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products  or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures we will be required to make in order to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in the competitive environment affecting our industry  we could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue  cash flows and net income 
as a result of the financial strength and benefits of scale enjoyed by some of our competitors  they may be able to offer services at lower prices than we can  thereby adversely affecting our revenues  growth and profitability 
if we are unable to meet our future capital needs relating to investment in our networks and other obligations  it may be necessary for us to curtail  delay or abandon our business growth plans 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans or experience a significant decline in financial performance  our borrowing costs could increase or our ability to raise additional capital could be limited 
a recent downgrade in our rating could cause us to incur higher interest costs and negatively impact our access to the capital markets 
we likely will require additional capital to make the capital expenditures necessary to implement our business plans  including our fourth generation network  to support future growth of our wireless business and to satisfy our debt service requirements 
in addition  we may incur additional debt in the future for a variety of reasons  including future acquisitions 
we may not be able to arrange additional financing to fund our requirements on terms acceptable to us 
our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on  among other factors  our ratings  financial performance  general economic conditions and prevailing market conditions 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
one debt rating agency recently downgraded our rating to below investment grade  and this may cause us to incur higher interest costs and our access to the capital markets could be negatively impacted 
our access to the commercial paper market may not be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
failure to obtain suitable financing when needed could  among other things  result in our inability to continue to expand our businesses and meet competitive challenges 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness  or if we do not continue to generate sufficient cash from our operations  our ratings could be adversely affected  which would likely increase our future borrowing costs and could affect our ability to access capital 

table of contents our credit facilities require that we maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other non cash gains or losses  such as goodwill impairment charges  of no more than to  which as of december   was to if we do not continue to satisfy this ratio  either because we do not generate sufficient cash from operations or otherwise  we will be in default under our credit facilities  which could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated 
if we are unable to improve our results of operations  we face the possibility of additional charges against earnings for impairments of goodwill and other assets 
in connection with our annual assessment for impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  we reduced the goodwill and consolidated shareholders equity by billion in the fourth quarter as part of this annual assessment  we updated the forecasted cash flows of our wireless reporting unit 
if we are unable to improve our results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  such as a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  we may incur another  material charge against earnings relating to our remaining goodwill 
in addition  we review our wireless and wireline long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if we are unable to improve our results of operations and cash flows  such a review could lead to a material impairment charge in our consolidated financial statements 
we have entered into outsourcing agreements related to certain business operations 
any difficulties experienced in these arrangements could result in additional expense  loss of customers and revenue  interruption of our services or a delay in the roll out of new technology 
we have entered into outsourcing agreements for the development and maintenance of certain software systems necessary for the operation of our business 
we have also entered into agreements with third parties to provide customer service and related support to our wireless subscribers and outsourced many aspects of our customer care and billing functions to third parties 
we also have entered into an agreement whereby a third party has leased or operates a significant number of our communications towers  and we sublease space on these towers 
as a result  we must rely on third parties to perform certain of our operations and  in certain circumstances  interface with our customers 
if these third parties are unable to perform to our requirements  we would have to pursue alternative strategies to provide these services and that could result in delays  interruptions  additional expenses and loss of customers 
the intellectual property rights utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others 
some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products from suppliers  including handset device suppliers  and outsource services to service providers  including billing and customer care functions  that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  and may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
such claims and assertions also could subject us to costly litigation and significant liabilities for damages or royalty payments  or require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services 
all suppliers of our cdma handsets license intellectual property from qualcomm 
some of this qualcomm intellectual property has been found to infringe on certain patents owned by broadcom corporation 
the international trade commission has found that qualcomm infringes certain of broadcom s intellectual property  and a united states district court recently enjoined qualcomm from further infringement of other patents and from certain other activities 
although that injunction is effective immediately  the ruling contains a 
table of contents sunset provision for certain qualcomm products  which expires on january   that provides time for qualcomm to modify its infringing products to avoid infringement 
if qualcomm does not modify its products so as to avoid infringement of broadcom s patents at issue by january   qualcomm will be unable to sell or support those products that were found to infringe and we may be unable to use cdma handsets that are the subject of these claims  including handsets that utilize qualcomm s qchat technology  which we intend to use to provide walkie talkie services on our cdma network 
we are currently unable to use other qualcomm products found to be infringing that are not subject to the sunset provision 
if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and handsets in support of our iden based services  as well as anticipated handset and infrastructure improvements for those services  our operations will be adversely affected 
motorola is our sole source for most of the equipment that supports the iden network and for all of the handsets we offer under the nextel brand except primarily for blackberry devices 
although our handset supply agreement with motorola is structured to provide competitively priced handsets  the cost of iden handsets is generally higher than handsets that do not incorporate a similar multi function capability 
this difference may make it more difficult or costly for us to offer handsets at prices that are attractive to potential customers 
in addition  the higher cost of iden handsets requires us to absorb a larger part of the cost of offering handsets to new and existing customers 
these increased costs and handset subsidy expenses may reduce our growth and profitability 
also  we must rely on motorola to develop handsets and equipment capable of supporting the features and services we offer to subscribers of services on our iden network  including the dual mode handsets 
a decision by motorola to discontinue manufacturing  supporting or enhancing our iden based infrastructure and handsets would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  because iden technology is not as widely adopted and has fewer subscribers than other wireless technologies and because we expect that over time more of our customers will utilize service offered on our cdma network  it is less likely that manufacturers other than motorola will be willing to make the significant financial commitment required to license  develop and manufacture iden infrastructure equipment and handsets 
further  our ability to timely and efficiently implement the spectrum reconfiguration plan in connection with the fcc s report and order is dependent  in part  on motorola 
the reconfiguration process contemplated by the fcc s report and order may adversely affect our business and operations  which could adversely affect our future growth and operating results 
in order to accomplish the reconfiguration of the mhz spectrum band that is contemplated by the report and order  in most cases we will need to cease our use of a portion of the mhz spectrum on our iden network in a particular market before we are able to commence use of replacement mhz spectrum in that market 
to mitigate the temporary loss of the use of this spectrum  in many markets we will need to construct additional transmitter and receiver sites or acquire additional spectrum in the mhz or mhz bands 
this spectrum may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
in markets where we are unable to construct additional sites or acquire additional spectrum as needed  the decrease in capacity may adversely affect the performance of our iden network  require us to curtail subscriber additions in those markets until the capacity limitation can be alleviated  or a combination of the two  particularly if the replacement of mhz spectrum is not available for a significant period of time 
the fcc recently ordered that we vacate by june a portion of the mhz spectrum that we currently use  even if the applicable public safety licensee is not ready to relocate to the vacated spectrum 
any delay by public safety licensees in relocating to the vacated spectrum  absent the grant of a waiver by the fcc  would delay when we could commence use of the replacement mhz spectrum 
degradation in network performance in any market would likely result in higher subscriber churn in that market  the effect of which could be exacerbated if we are forced to curtail subscriber additions in that market 
a resulting loss of a significant number of subscribers could adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that the reconfiguration process has contributed adversely to the capacity and performance of our iden network  particularly in some of our more capacity constrained markets 
in addition  the report and order gives the fcc the authority to suspend or otherwise limit our use of the ghz spectrum that we received under the report and order if we do not comply with our obligations under the report and order 

table of contents government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the fcc and other federal  state and local governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the licensing  construction  operation  sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the fcc and  depending on the jurisdiction  state and local regulatory agencies 
in particular  the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees  the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how such services may be offered  and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands 
the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation 
there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed 
failure to comply with fcc requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area 
depending upon their outcome  the fcc s proceedings regarding regulation of special access rates could affect the rates paid by our wireless and wireline segments for special access services in the future 
similarly  depending on their outcome  the fcc s proceedings on the regulatory classification of voip services could affect the intercarrier compensation rates and the level of usf contributions paid by us 
various states are considering regulations over terms and conditions of service  including such things as certain billing practices and consumer related issues that may not be pre empted by federal law 
if imposed  these regulations could make it more difficult and expensive to implement national sales and marketing programs and could increase the costs of our wireless operations 
our business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other disruptions 
major equipment failures  natural disasters  including severe weather  terrorist acts  cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security that affect our wireline and wireless networks  including transport facilities  communications switches  routers  microwave links  cell sites or other equipment or third party owned local and long distance networks on which we rely  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these events could disrupt our operations  require significant resources  result in a loss of customers or impair our ability to attract new customers  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our services 
portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks  including cancer  due to radio frequency emissions from these devices 
purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous wireless carriers  including us  seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase our cost of doing business 
we cannot be sure of the outcome of those cases or that our business and financial condition will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks 
the actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the mobile communications industry 
further research and studies are ongoing  and we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns

item legal proceedings in march  eight purported class action lawsuits relating to the recombination of our tracking stocks were filed against us and our directors by holders of pcs common stock 
seven of the lawsuits were consolidated in the district court of johnson county  kansas 
the eighth  pending in new york  was voluntarily stayed 
the consolidated lawsuit alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with allocations between the wireline operations and the wireless operations before the recombination of the tracking stocks and breach of fiduciary duty in the recombination 
the lawsuit was settled for an amount not material to the company  and the settlement was given final approval by the court on december  in september  the us district court for the district of kansas denied a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging that our and proxy statements were false and misleading in violation of federal securities laws to the extent they described new employment agreements with certain senior executives without disclosing that  according to the allegations  replacement of those executives was inevitable 
these allegations  made in an amended complaint in a lawsuit originally filed in  are asserted against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors  and seek to recover any decline in the value of our 
table of contents tracking stocks during the class period 
the parties have stipulated that the case can proceed as a class action 
all defendants have denied plaintiffs allegations and intend to defend this matter vigorously 
allegations in the original complaint  which asserted claims against the same defendants and our former independent auditor  were dismissed by the court in april our motion to dismiss the amended complaint was denied  and the parties are engaged in discovery 
a number of cases that allege sprint communications company lp failed to obtain easements from property owners during the installation of its fiber optic network in the s have been filed in various courts 
several of these cases sought certification of nationwide classes  and in one case  a nationwide class was certified 
in  a nationwide settlement of these claims was approved by the us district court for the northern district of illinois  but objectors appealed the preliminary approval order to the seventh circuit court of appeals  which overturned the settlement and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings 
the parties now are proceeding with litigation and or settlement negotiations on a state by state basis  and settlement negotiations have been coordinated in all cases but those pending in louisiana and tennessee 
the louisiana claims have been separately settled for an amount not material to the company  and that settlement was given final approval by the court  and the time to appeal that approval has expired 
in  we accrued an expense reflecting the estimated settlement costs of these suits 
various other suits  proceedings and claims  including purported class actions  typical for a large business enterprise  are pending against us or our subsidiaries 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these proceedings and whether they will be resolved consistent with our beliefs  we expect that the outcome of such proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation

we own extensive wireless networks and a global long distance  tier internet backbone 
on december   daniel r 
hesse joined our company as president and chief executive officer 
senior management is currently reviewing our operations and assessing our strategies and future business plans 

table of contents this process is still ongoing and  depending on the outcome  our operations  future capital requirements and future valuation of our long lived assets could be affected 
as part of our overall business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities to strengthen our business and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that  if consummated  could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
as a result  the forward looking information provided in this document is based only on information currently available to senior management 
we believe the communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price  the types of services and devices offered and quality of service 
although we believe that many of our targeted customers base their purchase decisions on quality of service and the availability of differentiated features and services  competitive pricing  both in terms of the monthly recurring charges and the number of minutes or other features available under a particular rate plan  and handset offerings and pricing are often important factors in potential customers purchase decisions 
the fcc regulates the licensing  operation  acquisition and sale of the licensed radio spectrum that is essential to our business 
the fcc and state public utilities commissions  or pucs  also regulate the provision of communications services 
future changes in regulations or legislation related to spectrum licensing or other matters related to our business could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations business segments we have two reportable segments wireless and wireline 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segments 
wireless products and services our strategy is to utilize state of the art technology to provide differentiated wireless services and applications in order to acquire and retain high quality wireless subscribers 
we offer a wide array of wireless mobile telephone and wireless data transmission services on networks that utilize cdma and iden technologies to meet the needs of individual consumers  businesses and government customers 
through our wireless segment  we  together with the pcs affiliates and resellers of our wholesale wireless services  offer digital wireless service in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and provide wireless coverage in metropolitan markets  including of the largest us metropolitan areas  serving about million wireless subscribers as of december  we offer wireless international voice roaming for subscribers of both cdma and iden based services in numerous countries 
our cdma network utilizes high speed evolution data optimized  or ev do  technology to provide high speed data applications 
we have incorporated ev do rev 
a  the most recent version of ev do technology that is designed to support a variety of ip  video and high performance walkie talkie applications  into over of our cdma network 
we offer a wide array of wireless mobile telephone and data transmission services and features in a variety of pricing plans  typically on a contract basis  for one or two year periods 
services are billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan  which typically includes a fixed charge for certain services and variable charges for other services 
we also offer wireless services that focus on the youth market  including our boost mobile prepaid wireless service on our iden network and our boost unlimited sm local calling wireless service on our cdma network 
we also offer wholesale cdma based wireless services to resellers  commonly known as mvnos  such as qwest communications international  inc  virgin mobile usa  helio inc  movida communications  inc  and embarq  which purchase wireless services from us at wholesale rates and resell the services to their customers under their own brand names 
under these mvno arrangements  the operators bear the costs of subscriber acquisition  billing and customer service 

table of contents we offer a broad portfolio of data services across our cdma network  including data messaging  photo and video offerings  entertainment and location based applications  marketed as power vision sm  and mobile broadband applications for laptops and other devices 
on our iden network  we continue to support features and services designed to meet the needs of our customers 
both the nextel and prepaid boost mobile brands feature our industry leading walkie talkie services  which give subscribers the ability to communicate instantly across the continental united states and to and from hawaii and  through agreements with other iden providers  to and from select markets in canada  latin america and mexico  as well as a variety of digital wireless mobile telephone and wireless data transmission services 
we offer some data services on the iden network  but that network does not support a full complement of data services and many of those services are available only with limited capabilities 
we offer devices that operate seamlessly between our cdma and iden networks marketed as powersource tm that enable us to offer wireless service that combines our cdma based voice and data applications and our iden based walkie talkie applications 
we are focusing our sales efforts of powersource devices on existing subscribers of certain iden services to offer them the benefit of higher data speeds on cdma 
in addition  we are also improving our product and service offerings on our iden network  which will include the introduction of several new handsets in we plan to utilize qualcomm incorporated s qchat technology  which is designed to provide high performance walkie talkie services on our cdma network  and we are designing interfaces to provide for interoperability of walkie talkie services on our cdma and iden networks 
upon successful launch of qchat devices  we expect that they will succeed the powersource devices 
currently  we are testing the qchat application on our cdma network and our goal is to launch commercial service offerings in for information regarding a dispute involving the intellectual property rights of qualcomm that relate to qchat  see item a 
risk factors the intellectual property rights utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others 
service revenue our wireless segment generates revenues from the provision of wireless services  the sale of wireless equipment and the provision of wholesale and other services 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of the number of subscribers that we serve  which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers  and the revenue generated from each subscriber  which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates that we charge for those services 
the declines in our subscriber base and revenue generated from each subscriber group discussed below have resulted in a decline in service revenue 
post paid and prepaid subscribers the wireless industry is subject to intense competition  which impacts our ability to attract and retain subscribers for wireless services 
most markets in which we operate have very high rates of penetration for wireless services  which will limit the growth of subscribers of wireless services 
consequently  we believe that wireless carriers must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from the existing customer bases of competitors rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
because of high penetration rates  first time purchasers of wireless services tend to have lower credit ratings or no credit history 
as a result  wireless carriers have focused considerable efforts on the care and service of existing subscribers and retention of valued customers 
some of our competitors have reported significant improvements in their post paid customer retention rates ie  rates of customer churn 
the combination of decreased rates of churn of some of our competitors  together with a slowing in the rate of subscriber growth  has reduced the pool of potential subscribers making wireless service provider decisions 

table of contents below is a table showing a net additions losses for the past twelve quarters of direct subscribers for our iden and cdma networks  excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations  existing subscribers who have migrated between networks and indirect subscribers of mvnos and pcs affiliates  b our total iden and cdma post paid subscribers as of each of the quarters in  and  and c our average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  net additions losses in thousands post paid iden cdma total boost mobile branded service iden based prepaid cdma based unlimited local calling plan total end of period subscribers in thousands iden post paid cdma post paid total post paid boost mobile prepaid boost mobile unlimited local calling plan total prepaid monthly customer churn rate direct post paid direct prepaid in the fourth quarter  we changed our subscriber deactivation policy for post paid subscribers to provide us additional time to retain subscribers who were subject to deactivation due to late payment 
to effect this change  the subscriber base as of october  was increased by  subscribers 
we adjusted our subscriber beginning balance so as to not increase our direct net subscriber additions or decrease the customer churn rates for the fourth quarter due to this policy change 
includes subscribers with powersource devices  introduced in the fourth quarter during the third quarter  we implemented an additional churn rule to remove the impact of activations and deactivations occurring within days in the same account 
the new rule  which we believe presents a more precise churn calculation  reduced churn by basis points to in the third quarter the additional churn rule did not impact reported net additions or results of operations 
prior period churn figures have not been adjusted for this additional churn rule 

table of contents during  we endeavored to retain subscribers and attract new subscribers by improving our customer care and sales and distribution functions 
in addition  we took other actions in an effort to improve our customers experience including improving our network performance by adding cell sites to expand the coverage and capacity of our networks  enhancing our brand awareness by increased media spending  and broadening our handset portfolio primarily through the introduction of new cdma and powersource handsets 
we added about million net post paid subscribers on the cdma network in  however  we have experienced a continued decline in the number of new post paid cdma subscribers in the fourth quarter competitive marketing conditions including increased advertising and promotions by our competitors have contributed to the decline in the number of new customers 
earlier in the year  we adjusted our credit policy in certain markets in an effort to attract new subscribers 
in late  we adjusted our credit policies and returned to policy standards similar to those in mid  which also contributed to the decline in subscriber additions on our cdma platform in the fourth quarter we continually monitor and adjust our credit policies in an effort to attract desirable and profitable customers  including our lower credit quality customers 
our ratio of subscribers with a subprime credit rating to those with a prime credit rating has decreased slightly from the fourth quarter refer to results of operations segment results of operations wireless wireless segment earnings below for a discussion of subscriber trends 
we have experienced declines in the number of new iden post paid subscribers in recent quarters and we lost about million net post paid subscribers on this network during consumer sentiment regarding the iden network  reduced marketing programs and limited new handset offerings at higher than market prices have all contributed to the decline in new iden customers 
we calculate churn by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter 
net subscriber deactivations are used in the numerator of the churn calculation 
for accounts comprised of multiple subscribers  such as family plans and enterprise accounts  net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within days 
post paid churn consists of both voluntary churn  where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer  and involuntary churn  where we terminate the customer s service due to a lack of payment or other reasons 
involuntary deactivations represent slightly over half of all deactivations on our cdma network in although overall post paid churn was relatively flat in as compared to  post paid churn on our iden platform increased  which was offset by reduced post paid churn on our cdma platform 
voluntary churn on the iden network has been adversely impacted by customer sentiment related to the network  limited handset offerings at higher than market prices  and customer care experience 
our overall post paid churn remains high relative to that of our competitors for the same reasons 
prepaid subscriber churn increased as compared to  primarily due to competition in our prepaid and youth markets from new entrants 
refer to results of operations segment results of operations wireless wireless segment earnings below for a discussion of churn trends 
average revenue per subscriber below is a table showing our average revenue per post paid and prepaid subscriber for the past twelve quarters 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  average monthly service revenue per user direct post paid direct prepaid average monthly service revenue per subscriber for the quarter is calculated by dividing our quarterly service revenue by the sum of our average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter 
changes in average monthly post paid service revenue are due to changes in the rate plans we offer and usage of our service and applications by subscribers 
the decline in our average monthly voice revenue is primarily due to the loss of subscribers with higher priced service plans  while new subscribers and the subscribers acquired from the pcs affiliates have lower priced service plans 
in addition  the decline is partly attributable to the migration of our existing customers to family add on plans or plans that include roaming in their service plan  as well as increased sales to businesses and the government  which receive favorable 
table of contents volume based pricing 
in addition to our standard voice plans  we offer data plans or add on plans that provide our customers offerings such as short message service  or sms  connection cards and our sprint vision and power vision service plan 
as these products and services are becoming increasingly popular with our customers  the decline in the average voice revenue per subscriber is being partially offset by an increase in the average data revenue per post paid subscriber 
there is no assurance that data service revenue per subscriber will continue to grow at current rates or eventually offset the declines in voice revenue 
segment earnings wireless segment earnings is primarily a function of wireless service revenue  costs to acquire subscribers  network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other wireless segment operating expenses 
the costs to acquire our customers includes the net cost at which we sell our handsets  referred to as handset subsidies  as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those customers 
network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs generally consist of per minute use fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers 
the remaining costs associated with operating the wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization  back office support and bad debt expense 
wireless service revenue  costs to acquire subscribers  and network and interconnection costs are generally variable in nature and fluctuate with the growth in our subscriber base but certain elements are fixed 
megahertz spectrum reconfiguration under the fcc s report and order  we are required to complete a reconfiguration plan that is designed to eliminate interference with public safety operators in the mhz spectrum band through a spectrum reallocation that will result in more efficient use of mhz spectrum 
for a more detailed discussion of the report and order and its impact on us  see item business legislative and regulatory developments regulations and wireless operations mhz band spectrum reconfiguration 
the report and order implemented rules to reconfigure spectrum in the mhz band in a month phased transition process 
we surrendered certain portions of our holdings in the mhz spectrum band and are obligated to fund the cost incurred by public safety systems and other incumbent licensees to reconfigure the mhz spectrum band 
as part of this process  in most markets  we must cease using portions of mhz spectrum during the reconfiguration before we are able to commence use of replacement mhz spectrum 
based on the terms of the report and order and subsequent fcc and mhz transition administrator  or ta  actions  we have been planning and implementing spectrum exchanges with each affected public safety agency based upon that agency s ability to complete the reconfiguration process  thereby limiting the time from when we cease using the surrendered spectrum and when the replacement spectrum is available for our use 
in september  the fcc issued an order  the third mo o  that  among other things  requires that by june we vacate many mhz channels that we currently use  even if the applicable public safety licensee is not ready to relocate to the vacated spectrum  which could result in a sudden and significant decrease in network capacity  which in turn would adversely affect the performance of our iden network 
we have appealed this order in the us court of appeals for the us circuit 
if this order is not overturned or modified  we could attempt to construct additional sites or acquire additional spectrum  to the extent possible 
in those markets where these network investments are not possible  we may be required to curtail subscriber additions and incent certain existing subscribers of iden services to use powersource devices or move to our cdma network until the capacity limitation can be alleviated  particularly if the replacement mhz spectrum is not available for an extended length of time 
degradation in network performance in any market could result in higher subscriber churn in that market 
the loss of a significant number of subscribers could adversely affect our results of operations 
based on the fcc s determination of the values of the spectrum rights received and surrendered  the minimum obligation to be incurred under the report and order is billion 
the report and order also 
table of contents provides that qualifying costs we incur as part of the reconfiguration plan  including costs to reconfigure our own infrastructure and spectrum positions  can be used to offset the minimum obligation of billion  however  we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed that amount 
in addition  a financial reconciliation is required to be completed at the end of the reconfiguration implementation to determine whether the value of the spectrum rights received exceeds the total of i the value of spectrum rights that are surrendered and ii the qualifying costs referred to above 
if so  we will be required to pay the difference to the us treasury  as described above 
based on the fcc s determination of the values of the spectrum rights received and surrendered by nextel  the minimum obligation to be incurred under the report and order is billion 
the report and order also provides that qualifying costs we incur as part of the reconfiguration plan  including costs to reconfigure our own infrastructure and spectrum positions  can be used to offset the minimum obligation of billion  however  we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed that amount 
from the inception of the program and through december   we have incurred approximately billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program 
this amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program 
if we are successful in our appeal of the third mo o  we estimate  based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available  that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfiguration will range between billion and billion 
this estimate is dependent on significant assumptions including the final licensee costs  and costs associated with relocating licensees in the canadian and mexican border regions for which there are currently no approved border plans 
in addition  the above range does not include any of our apportioned internal network costs 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
in addition  we are entitled to receive reimbursement from the mobile satellite service licensees for their pro rata portion of our costs of clearing a portion of the ghz spectrum 
those licensees may be unable or unwilling to reimburse us for their share of the costs  which we estimate to be approximately million 
if we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the third mo o  we anticipate that our costs could exceed billion by an amount that would likely be material 
however  we believe that it is unlikely we will be required to make a payment to the us treasury 
as required under the terms of the report and order  we delivered a billion letter of credit to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
although the report and order provides for the possibility of periodic reductions in the amount of the letter of credit  no reductions have been requested or made as of december  wireline through our wireline segment  we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services targeted to domestic business customers  multinational corporations and other communications companies 
these services include domestic and international data communications using various protocols  such as mpls technologies  ip  asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  frame relay  managed network services and voice services 
we also provide services to the cable msos that resell our local and long distance service or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user customers 
we are one of the nation s largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital long distance and tier ip networks 
for several years  our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies  as well as cable msos and internet service providers 
growth in voice services provided by cable msos is accelerating as consumers use cable msos as alternatives to local and long distance voice communications providers 
we continue to assess the portfolio of services provided by our wireline segment and are focusing our efforts on 
table of contents ip based services and de emphasizing stand alone voice services and non ip based data services 
for example  in addition to increased emphasis on selling ip and managed services  we are converting existing customers from atm and frame relay to more advanced ip technologies 
this conversion has and will continue to result in decreases in revenue from frame relay and atm service offset by increases in ip and mpls services 
we also are taking advantage of the growth in voice services provided by cable msos  by providing large cable msos with wholesale voice local and long distance  which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings  as well as traditional voice and data services for their enterprise use 
wimax initiative we plan to deploy a next generation broadband wireless network that will be designed to provide significantly higher data transport speeds using our spectrum holdings in the gigahertz  or ghz  band and technology based on the worldwide inter operability for microwave access  or wimax  standard 
we are designing this network to support a wide range of high speed ip based wireless services in a mobile environment 
our initial plans contemplate deploying the new network and introducing commercial service offerings in chicago  baltimore and washington  dc in mid we are exploring strategic initiatives and third party and other financing alternatives related to this initiative 
in  operating expenses related to this initiative totaled million and capital expenditures totaled million 
deployment of this network will continue to require capital resources  without any meaningful revenues  for the foreseeable future 
results of operations we present consolidated information  as well as separate supplemental financial information for our two reportable segments  wireless and wireline 
the disaggregated financial results for our two reportable segments have been prepared in a manner that is consistent with the basis and manner in which our executives evaluate segment performance and make resource allocation decisions 
consequently  segment earnings is defined as wireless or wireline operating income before other segment expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  severance  exit costs  asset impairments and other  goodwill impairment  and merger and integration expenses solely and directly attributable to the segment 
expenses and income items excluded from segment earnings are managed at the corporate level 
merger and integration expenses are generally non recurring in nature and primarily include costs for the launch of common customer interfacing systems  processes and other integration and planning activities  certain costs to provide wireless devices that operate seamlessly between the cdma and iden networks  certain customer care costs  costs to retain employees  costs related to re branding  and other integration costs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segments 
for reconciliations of segment earnings to the closest generally accepted accounting principles measure  operating income  see tables set forth in wireless and wireline below 
we generally account for transactions between segments based on fully distributed costs  which we believe approximate fair value 
in certain transactions  pricing is set using market rates 
consolidated our consolidated and wireless results of operations include the results of the merged and acquired companies from either the date of merger acquisition or the start of the month closest to the acquisition date 
as such  the results of merged and acquired companies are included as of the following dates nextel communications and us unwired from august   gulf coast wireless limited partnership from october   iwo holdings  inc from november   enterprise communications partnership and alamosa holdings  inc from february   nextel partners and ubiquitel inc from july  and northern pcs services  llc from august  the results of velocita wireless holding corporation are included from the date of acquisition  march   through the date of sale  june  for further information on business combinations  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

as a result of the spin off  we no longer own any interest in embarq 
the results of embarq for periods prior to the spin off are presented as discontinued operations 
the following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations

table of contents the following is a summary of our average subscribers and average revenue per subscriber for the years ended december   and the number of subscribers impacts service revenues  cost of service and bad debt expense  as well as support costs  such as customer care and billing  which are included in general and administrative expenses 
a summary of changes in net additions to subscribers and average monthly revenue per subscriber for each of the last three years may be found on pages and year ended december  change from previous year vs vs subscribers in thousands average post paid subscribers average prepaid subscribers average monthly service revenue per user direct post paid direct prepaid average direct post and prepaid average subscribers represent the weighted average number of direct subscribers included in our customer base during the period  including subscribers added through acquisitions  net of deactivated subscribers 
the average subscribers for the year ended december  are inclusive of  subscribers acquired through our acquisition of northern pcs  compared to  subscribers acquired through our acquisitions of certain pcs affiliates and nextel partners  and  and  subscribers acquired through the sprint nextel merger and the acquisitions of certain pcs affiliates 
service revenues decreased million or less than in as compared to  due to a decrease of approximately million in service revenue from our direct post paid subscribers 
this decrease is due primarily to a decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid user  attributable to a decrease in the average monthly voice revenue per post paid user  which is only partially offset by an increase in the average monthly data revenue per post paid user 
this decline is partially offset by an increase in revenue attributable to the increase in the weighted average number of direct post paid subscribers  offset by a net increase of approximately million in service revenue from our prepaid subscribers 
this increase is due primarily to an increase in the average number of direct prepaid subscribers  partially offset by a decline in average monthly service revenue per prepaid subscriber 
service revenues increased billion or in as compared to  due to a net increase of approximately billion in service revenue from our direct post paid subscribers  due primarily to an increase in the average number of direct post paid subscribers  most of which were acquired in the sprint nextel merger  and a net increase of approximately billion in service revenue from our prepaid subscribers  due primarily to an increase in the average number of direct prepaid subscribers  most of which were acquired in the sprint nextel merger 
the net increase in post paid subscribers is a function of several factors 
we believe that other than the subscribers acquired through business combinations  new subscribers are attracted to our differentiated products and services  particularly cdma based data related services  including those available under our sprint power vision service plans  and other non voice services 
within our existing customer base in  million 
table of contents subscribers  including over  subscribers in the fourth quarter  transferred from our iden subscriber base to take advantage of these products and services  which include data cards  downloading music  global positioning satellite  or gps  enabled navigation services  instant messaging and emails  sending and receiving pictures  playing on line games  browsing the internet wirelessly  and with our powersource handsets  using cdma based voice and data applications and our iden based walkie talkie applications 
offsetting the increase in cdma subscribers  we have also experienced a continued decline in iden subscribers in addition to those that transferred from the iden subscriber base to the cdma subscriber base 
we believe that this decline was due in part to customer sentiment related to the network  limited handset offerings at higher than market prices and customer care experience 
see subscriber trends discussed in wireless segment earnings below 
the average monthly service revenue per post paid subscriber generally decreased year over year due primarily to declines in voice revenue per subscriber 
this decline is primarily due to the loss of subscribers with higher priced service plans  while new subscribers and the subscribers acquired from the pcs affiliates have lower priced service plans 
in addition  the decline is partly attributable to the migration of our existing customers to family add on plans or plans that include roaming in their service plan  as well as increased sales to businesses and the government  which receive favorable volume based pricing 
this decline in the average voice revenue per subscriber is partially offset by an increase in the average data revenue per post paid subscriber  which is attributable to our cdma based data offerings such as short message service  or sms  connection cards and our sprint vision and power vision service plans 
the decrease in the average monthly service revenue per prepaid subscriber in the year ended december  is due in part to a decrease in usage of wireless services by our existing customers 
see average monthly service revenue per post paid subscriber trends discussed in wireless segment earnings below 
wholesale  affiliate and other revenue wholesale  affiliate and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of wireless services to companies that resell those services to their subscribers and net revenues retained from wireless subscribers residing in pcs affiliate territories 
wholesale  affiliate and other revenues increased in as compared to primarily due to increases in our wholesale operators subscribers 
wholesale  affiliate and other revenues decreased in as compared to primarily due to the pcs affiliate acquisitions 
in  wholesale subscriber additions were million  resulting in about million wholesale subscribers at december   compared to about million wholesale subscribers at december  and million wholesale subscribers at december  cost of services cost of services consists primarily of costs to operate and maintain our cdma and iden networks  including direct switch and cell site costs  such as rent  utilities  maintenance  payroll costs associated with our network engineering employees and frequency leasing costs  fixed and variable interconnection costs  the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site  and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline and wireless providers for calls terminating on their networks  which fluctuates in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls  long distance costs paid to the wireline business  costs to service and repair handsets and activate service for new subscribers  
table of contents roaming fees paid to other carriers  and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications  such as ringers  games  music  tv and navigation by our customers 
cost of services increased in as compared to primarily due to increased costs relating to the expansion of our network and increased minutes of use on our networks 
specifically  we experienced an increase in roaming expenses  primarily with respect to subscribers of our cdma services  due to increased data and voice usage outside of our cdma network  and an increase in cell site and switch related operational costs  including increases in rent and fixed and variable interconnection costs due to the increase in usage  number of cell sites and related equipment in service 
cost of services increased in as compared to  primarily due to increased costs resulting from the sprint nextel merger 
service gross margin declined in as compared to and increased in as compared to  due to the reasons described above 
as a percentage of total service revenue  service gross margin decreased slightly to in from in and in equipment revenue we recognize equipment revenue when title to the handset or accessory passes to the dealer or end user customer 
we reduce equipment revenue for certain payments to third party dealers  which reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories decreased in as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in the average sales price of handsets due to more aggressive acquisition and retention handset pricing  which was only slightly offset by an increase in the number of handsets sold 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories increased in as compared to  primarily due to additional handsets sold due to the sprint nextel merger and the pcs affiliate and nextel partners acquisitions 
cost of products we recognize the cost of handsets and accessories when title to the handset or accessory passes to the dealer or end user customer 
cost of handsets and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence 
the cost of handsets is reduced by any rebates that we earn from the supplier 
handset and accessory costs increased in as compared to due to the increase in the number of handsets sold and an increase in the average cost of the units sold as we continue to sell higher priced units with more functionality 
handset and accessory costs increased in as compared to primarily due to additional handsets sold due to the sprint nextel merger and the pcs affiliate and nextel partners acquisitions 
subsidy our marketing plans assume that handsets typically will be sold at prices below our cost  which is consistent with industry practice 
our subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to customers such as offering new handsets at discounted prices 
handset costs in excess of the revenues generated from handset sales referred to in our industry as subsidy as a percentage of equipment revenues increased to in from in and in  as a result of efforts to promote the acquisition of new and retention of existing subscribers 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs  including commissions paid to our indirect dealers  third party distributors and direct sales force for new handset activations and upgrades  residual payments to our indirect dealers  payroll and facilities costs associated with our direct sales force  retail stores and marketing employees  advertising  media programs and sponsorships  including costs related to branding 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing  customer care and information technology operations  bad debt expense and back office support activities  including collections  legal  finance  human resources  strategic planning and technology and product development 
sales and marketing expense increased about in from as compared to an increase of in from for the year ended december   we experienced increased advertising expense  reflecting our renewed focus on promoting our brand in an effort to gain market share by attracting new subscribers and continuing to build loyalty among existing subscribers  and we increased compensation of our post paid third party dealers for both new subscriber additions and upgrades 
general and administrative costs increased about in from as compared to an increase of in from  primarily due to increases in bad debt expense resulting from higher average write offs per account and increases in customer care costs due to higher call volumes and additional customer care representatives 
these costs were partially offset by decreases in it and billing costs due to application rationalization  including financial reporting and billing system consolidations 
bad debt expense increased million in to million  as compared to a million increase in to million 
the increase was primarily the result of higher average write offs per account  which accounted for about of the increase in bad debt 
increases in the average write offs per account can be attributed to a higher number of subscribers per account  increased add a phone activity  increased incidence of overages  increased fees related to data services and increased credit extended in early and the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of subscribers  including subscribers acquired through acquisitions  and an increase in involuntary churn 
wireless segment earnings wireless segment earnings decreased about billion or in from primarily due to increases in costs to acquire our subscribers  due to lower equipment revenue  and increases in network and interconnection costs 
wireless segment earnings increased billion or in from  primarily due to increased revenue resulting from additional subscribers acquired in connection with the sprint nextel merger and the pcs affiliate and nextel partners acquisitions 
based on information currently available to management  we expect to experience continued downward pressure on wireless segment earnings in the near term  including a significant reduction in the first quarter as compared to our wireless segment earnings of about billion in the fourth quarter specifically  we expect service revenue to continue to decline in the near term due to expected declines in the number of new subscribers and increases in churn including churn on our cdma network for the reasons discussed on page  as well as a decline in our average monthly service revenue per user as growth from our data services is expected to only partially offset declines in voice services 
in addition  because we plan to lower the prices of certain handset devices  our equipment net subsidy may increase  which could increase the overall cost to acquire subscribers 
although management has implemented a program designed to rationalize our cost structure by reducing our workforce  decreasing the number of external contractors and eliminating poor performing distribution points  we do not expect that these cost reductions will offset the expected service revenue declines and increases in net equipment subsidy described above

this decrease was partially offset by a higher volume of minutes in our affiliate business and growth in our voip business 
voice revenues voice revenues decreased in as compared to and decreased in as compared to the decrease was primarily a result of certain business customers that were transferred to embarq as part of the spin off in the second quarter  as well as a decrease in our customer base and continued price declines 
also contributing to the decrease is the loss of conference line customers due to the final transition of those activities in the third quarter as part of the sale of that business 
the decrease also reflects the sale of our unbundled network element platform  or une p  customers in the first quarter our retail business experienced a decrease in voice revenues of in as compared to  and a decrease of in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the loss of accounts related to the embarq spin off  the sale of our conference line business and lower prices 
the decrease was primarily due to increased competition  which resulted in lower prices per minute notwithstanding increased minute volumes 
our business trends continue to shift away from the retail business and toward the wholesale business 
voice revenues related to our wholesale business increased in as compared to and increased about in as compared to minute volume increases accounted for the and increases  primarily as a result of our relationship with embarq

service gross margin percentage decreased from in to in to in  primarily as a result of declining net services revenue and a lower margin product mix 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased in as compared to and decreased in as compared to the decline was due primarily to recognition of a prepaid license from vonage covering the use of certain patents within our patent portfolio  as well as a reduction in employee headcount  reduced commissions as a result of the spin off of embarq and decreased customer care and billing expenses due to a smaller customer base 
these declines were partially offset by increases in costs associated with cable voip support 
the decline was due primarily to decreased marketing and advertising as a result of a change in the mix of marketing strategies and lower general and administrative and information technology expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense includes charges for estimated bad debt expense 
each quarter we reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer specific indicators  as well as historical trends and industry data  to ensure we are adequately reserved

see forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations  either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because they require the exercise of significant judgment and or use of significant estimates 
while management believes that the estimates used are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues  revenues generated from handset and accessory sales and revenues from wholesale operators and pcs affiliates  as well as long distance voice  data and internet revenues 
service revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges  variable usage charges such as roaming  directory assistance  and operator assisted calling and miscellaneous fees  such as activation  upgrade  late payment  reconnection and early termination fees and certain regulatory related fees 
we recognize service revenues as services are rendered and equipment revenue when title passes to the dealer or end user customer  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts  billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage 
we recognize excess wireless usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
additionally  we recognize excess wireless data usage based on kilobytes and one time use charges  such as for the use of premium services  when rendered 
as a result of the cutoff times of our multiple billing cycles each month  we are required to estimate the amount of subscriber revenues earned but not billed from the end of each bill cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and our historical usage and billing patterns 
subscriber revenue earned but not billed represented about of our accounts receivable balance as of december  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
because of the number of accounts that we have  it is not practical to review the collectibility of each of those accounts individually when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts each period  although we do perform some account level analysis with respect to large wireless and wireline customers 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors  including collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable portfolios  the credit quality of our subscriber base  estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales  and other qualitative considerations  including macro economic factors 
the accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue in the results of operations require us to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with customers  unauthorized usage  and future returns and mail in rebates on handset sales 
the allowance amounts recorded represent our best estimate of 
table of contents future outcomes  to the extent that our actual experience differs significantly from historical trends  the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate 
any resulting adjustments would change the net accounts receivable reported on our balance sheet  and bad debt expense  in the case of estimates related to doubtful accounts  or revenue  in the case of estimates related to other allowances  reported in our results of operations in future periods 
for example  if our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate were to change by  it would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of million for the wireless segment and million for the wireline segment 
device and accessory inventory inventories of handsets and accessories in the wireless segment are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost by the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
handset costs and related revenues are recognized at the time of sale 
we do not recognize the expected handset subsidies prior to the time of sale because the promotional discount decision is made at the point of sale  and we expect to recover the handset subsidies through service revenues 
as of december   we held million of inventory 
we analyze the realizable value of our handset and other inventory on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes assessing obsolescence  sales forecasts  product life cycle and marketplace and other considerations 
if our assessments regarding the above factors change  we may be required to sell handsets at a higher subsidy or potentially record expense in future periods prior to the point of sale to the extent that we expect that we will be unable to sell handsets or use them in the service and repair channel 
valuation and recoverability of certain long lived assets including definite lived intangible assets a significant portion of our total assets are long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
property  plant and equipment represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives as follows long lived assets estimated useful life average useful life buildings and improvements to years years network equipment  site costs and software to years years non network internal use software  office equipment and other to years years we calculate depreciation on certain of our assets using the group life method 
accordingly  ordinary asset retirements and disposals are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized 
since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change  we perform annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property  plant and equipment 
these studies take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions about technology evolution  to calculate the remaining life of our asset base 
when these factors indicate that an asset s useful life is different from the original assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted estimated useful life 
during the first quarter  we implemented depreciation rate changes with respect to assets that comprise the cdma and wireline networks resulting from our annual depreciable lives study 
these revised rates reflected both changes in the useful life estimates of certain of our asset groups and adjustments to our 
table of contents accumulated depreciation accounts 
the reduced expense associated with the depreciation rate changes resulted in approximately million reduction in depreciation expense or per share reduction in net loss for the year ended december  in addition to performing our annual study  we also continue to assess the estimated useful life of the iden network assets  which had a net carrying value of billion as of december   and our future strategic plans for this network  as an increasingly larger portion of our subscriber base is served by our cdma network 
a reduction in our estimate of the useful life of the iden network assets would cause increased depreciation charges in future periods that could be material 
for example  a reduction in the remaining weighted average useful life of the iden network assets would increase annual depreciation expense by about million 
in conjunction with our fourth quarter goodwill impairment review  we re assessed the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets and concluded they were appropriate 
we are in the process of completing our annual depreciation study and expect any results from that study to be concluded and initially recorded in the first quarter intangible assets with definite useful lives represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships that are amortized over two to five years using the sum of the years digits method  which we believe best reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed 
other definite lived intangible assets primarily include certain rights under affiliation agreements that we reacquired in connection with the acquisitions of certain pcs affiliates and nextel partners  which are being amortized over the remaining terms of those affiliation agreements on a straight line basis  and the nextel and direct connect trade names  which are being amortized over ten years from the date of the sprint nextel merger on a straight line basis 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives of our definite lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization  which would be addressed prospectively 
for example  we review certain trends such as customer churn  average revenue per user  revenue  our future plans regarding the iden network and changes in marketing strategies  among others 
significant changes in certain trends may cause us to adjust  on a prospective basis  the remaining estimated life of certain of our definite lived intangible assets 
for additional information  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we group our long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
our asset groups consist of wireless and wireline  and the wireless asset group includes our intangible assets  our wireless property  plant and equipment and goodwill 
indicators of impairment for our asset groups include  but are not limited to  a sustained significant decrease in the market price of or the cash flows expected to be derived from the asset groups  or a significant change in the extent or manner in which the assets in the group are utilized 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
impairment analyses  when performed  are based on our current business and technology strategy  our views of growth rates for our business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
in conjunction with our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment  we performed a recoverability test of the wireless long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we included cash flow projections from our wireless operations along with cash flows associated with the eventual disposition of the long lived assets  which included estimated proceeds from the sale of fcc licenses  trade names  and customer relationships 
the undiscounted future cash flows of the wireless long lived assets exceeded their net book value 
as a result  no impairment charge was recorded 
in addition to the analyses described above  we periodically assess certain assets that have not yet been deployed in our business  including network equipment  cell site development costs  and software in development  to determine if an impairment charge is required 
network equipment and cell site development 
table of contents costs are impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances cause us to abandon such assets if they are no longer needed to meet management s strategic network plans 
software development costs are impaired when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed 
for the year ended december   we recorded an after tax impairment charge of million primarily related to the abandonment of certain iden cell sites under construction 
for the year ended december   we recorded an after tax impairment charge of million primarily related to software asset impairments and abandonments of various assets  including certain cell sites under construction 
for the year ended december   we recorded an after tax impairment charge of million primarily related to the write off of various software applications 
we also periodically assess network equipment that has been removed from the network to determine if an impairment charge is required 
if we continue to have challenges retaining iden subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iden network  management may abandon certain iden assets in future periods if we conclude those assets will either never be deployed or redeployed  in which case we would recognize a non cash impairment charge that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation and recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets with indefinite useful lives represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we have identified fcc licenses and our sprint and boost mobile trademarks as indefinite lived intangible assets  in addition to our goodwill  after considering the expected use of the assets  the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used  and the effects of obsolescence on their use 
we review our goodwill  which relates solely to our wireless reporting unit  and other indefinite lived intangibles annually in the fourth quarter for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include  a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or slower growth rates  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
when required  we first test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our wireless reporting unit with its net book value 
if the fair value of the wireless reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired  and no further testing would be necessary 
if the net book value of our wireless reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
to measure the amount of any impairment loss  we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if our wireless reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we record an impairment charge for the difference 
during the period from our annual goodwill impairment assessment through the third quarter  we periodically analyzed whether any indicators of impairment had occurred 
as part of these periodic analyses  we derived the estimated equity value of the wireless reporting unit  which we then compared to its net book value 
specifically  we reduced our stock price by the estimated value per share of our wireline reporting unit and then added a control premium  as permitted by fasb guidance  to determine an estimate of the equity value of the wireless reporting unit 
as the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit was higher than its net book value during each of these periods  no additional testing was necessary 
in the fourth quarter  we conducted our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment 
during this quarter  we experienced a sustained  significant decline in our stock price 
the reduced market capitalization reflected the wireless segment s lower than expected performance  due in large part to fewer than expected net 
table of contents subscriber additions 
in previous periods  we had expected that we would be able to produce net post paid subscriber additions during in the fourth quarter  we reported a loss of  post paid subscribers which was the most post paid subscribers we had ever lost in a quarter 
we also updated our forecasted cash flows of the wireless reporting unit during the fourth quarter 
this update considered current economic conditions and trends  estimated future operating results  our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions  and the availability of necessary technology  network infrastructure  handsets and other devices 
several factors led to a reduction in forecasted cash flows  including  among others  our ability to attract and retain subscribers  particularly subscribers of our iden based services  in a highly competitive environment  expected reductions in voice revenue per subscriber  the costs of acquiring subscribers  and the costs of operating our wireless networks 
based on the results of our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment  the net book value of the wireless reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
therefore  we performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
specifically  we hypothetically allocated the fair value of the wireless reporting unit as determined in the first step to our recognized and unrecognized net assets  including allocations to intangible assets such as customer relationships  fcc licenses and trade names 
such items had fair values substantially in excess of current book values 
the resulting implied goodwill was million  accordingly  we reduced the goodwill recorded prior to this assessment by billion to write our goodwill down to the implied goodwill amount as of december  the billion goodwill impairment charge is our best estimate of the goodwill charge as of december  any adjustment to that estimated charge resulting from the completion of the measurement of the impairment loss will be recognized in the first quarter the allocation discussed above is performed only for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment  accordingly  we do not adjust the net book value of the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet other than goodwill as a result of this process 
we performed extensive valuation analyses  utilizing both income and market approaches  in our goodwill assessment process 
the following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the fair value of the wireless reporting unit 
income approach to determine fair value  we discounted the expected cash flows of the wireless reporting unit 
the discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our wireless operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model  we used a terminal value approach 
under this approach  we used estimated operating income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model  adjusted it to estimate a normalized cash flow  applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value 
we incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 
market based approach to corroborate the results of the income approach described above  we estimated the fair value of our wireless reporting unit using several market based approaches  including the value that we derive based on our consolidated stock price as described above 
we also used the guideline company method  which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar guideline publicly traded companies 
the determination of fair value of the wireless reporting unit and other assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  operating income before depreciation and amortization  or oibda and capital expenditures forecasts 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we evaluated the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair value of the wireless reporting unit  as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit  and concluded they are reasonable 

table of contents changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill impairment charge 
for example  a decrease in oibda by or an increase in capital expenditures by would result in an additional goodwill impairment charge equal to our remaining goodwill of million 
conversely  an increase in oibda by or a decrease in capital expenditures by would result in a reduction to the goodwill impairment charge by billion and billion  respectively 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an approximate million increase or decrease to the goodwill or impairment charge  respectively 
a basis point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an approximate million decrease or increase to the charge  respectively 
the sensitivity amounts above are calculated based on the impact of the change in the fair value of the wireless reporting unit  as well as the impact of changes in the fair values of the assets and liabilities of the wireless reporting unit 
the allocation of the fair value of the wireless reporting unit to individual assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  customer relationships  fcc licenses  trademarks and current replacement costs for certain property  plant and equipment 
when required  we test other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment by comparing the asset s respective carrying value to estimates of fair value  determined using the direct value method 
our fcc licenses are combined as a single unit of accounting following the unit of accounting guidance as prescribed by eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  except for our fcc licenses in the ghz band  which are tested separately as a single unit of accounting 
the accounting estimates related to our indefinite lived intangible assets require us to make significant assumptions about fair values 
our assumptions regarding fair values require significant judgment about economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations  as well as our views regarding the prospects of our business 
changes in these judgments may have a significant effect on the estimated fair values 
tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions we are required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
we record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
the accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
these assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material 
we carried an income tax valuation allowance of million as of december  this amount includes a valuation allowance of million for the total tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards  subject to utilization restrictions  acquired in connection with certain acquisitions 
the remainder of the valuation allowance relates to capital loss  state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
within our total valuation allowance  we had million related to separate company state net operating losses incurred by our subsidiaries after we acquired them 
the valuation allowance was provided on these separate company state net operating loss benefits since these subsidiaries do not have a sufficient history of taxable income 
current analyses of cumulative historical income and qualitative factors indicate that the valuation allowance continues to be appropriate  meaning that we currently believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize such tax benefits in the future 
we will continue to monitor these analyses and factors in future periods and may adjust the valuation allowance based on the facts and circumstances existing in future periods 
for the valuation allowance relating to the acquired tax benefits described above  if we reverse any allowance in  we would first reduce 
table of contents goodwill or intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions 
any adjustment to the valuation allowance after would be recorded to the statement of operations following the guidance in the recently issued sfas no

we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  on january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
if we determine it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits  we record the impact of the position in our consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
these estimates are updated at each reporting date based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
we are also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fin our liability for uncertain tax positions was million as of december  actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes could have a significant impact on our financial position

capital requirements we currently anticipate that future funding needs in the near term will principally relate to operating expenses relating to our segment operations  capital expenditures  particularly with respect to the expansion of the coverage and capacity of our wireless networks and the deployment of new technologies in those networks  including our plans to build a next generation broadband wireless network  scheduled interest and principal payments related to our debt and any purchases or redemptions of our debt securities  amounts required to be expended in connection with the report and order  increasing expenditures for income taxes  after utilization of available tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  potential costs of compliance with regulatory mandates  and other general corporate expenditures 
liquidity as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion 
we have a billion revolving credit facility  which expires in december and provides for interest rates equal to the london interbank offered rate  or libor  or prime rate plus a spread that varies depending on our parent company s credit ratings 
there is no rating trigger that would allow the lenders to terminate this facility in the event of a credit rating downgrade 

table of contents in april  we commenced a commercial paper program  which reduced our borrowing costs by allowing us to issue short term debt at lower rates than those available under our billion revolving credit facility 
the billion program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces the amount we can borrow under the facility to the extent of the commercial paper outstanding 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding 
as of december   we had billion in letters of credit  including a billion letter of credit required by the report and order  outstanding under our billion revolving credit facility 
these letters of credit reduce the availability under the revolving credit facility by an equivalent amount 
as a result of the letters of credit and outstanding commercial paper  as of december   we had about billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
in light of conditions in our business and the financial markets  we have taken actions designed to enhance our financial flexibility 
first  in early  we decided that we will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
second  in late february  we drew down billion under our revolving credit facility to mitigate potential refinancing risk related to billion in bonds that mature in november and our commercial paper program  as well as to enhance our financial flexibility in general 
we now have about million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
our credit facilities require that we maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarter earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of no more than to  and as of december   the ratio was to a default under our credit facilities could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated 
our credit facilities and the indentures that govern our outstanding senior notes also require that we comply with various covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by us and our subsidiaries 
our credit facility covenants limit our subsidiaries other than nextel communications and sprint capital corp 
from incurring indebtedness or liens in excess of of our consolidated shareholders equity 
as of december   indebtedness from such subsidiaries totaled billion 
accordingly  the fourth quarter charge related to the impairment of our goodwill has caused a reduction in the amount of debt and liens that can be incurred under our credit facilities by certain of our subsidiaries 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants associated with our borrowings 
our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately impacted by the overall capacity and terms available from the banking and securities markets 
given the volatility in these markets  we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital 
on february   one debt rating agency downgraded our rating to below investment grade 
downgrades of our current short or long term ratings to below investment grade would not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt 
the downgrade of our rating may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our borrowings and our access to the public capital markets could be negatively impacted 
our access to the commercial paper market may not be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to working capital of million as of december  
table of contents future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events  including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see forward looking statements 
future contractual obligations total and thereafter in millions senior notes  bank credit facilities  debentures and commercial paper capital leases operating leases purchase orders and other commitments total includes principal and estimated interest payments 
interest payments are based on management s expectations for future interest rates 
represents capital lease payments including interest 
includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites  real estate  network equipment and office space 
includes service  spectrum  network capacity and other executory contracts 
excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of billion 
see below for further discussion 
the table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligation under the report and order 
the total minimum cash obligation for the report and order is billion 
costs incurred under the report and order associated with the reconfiguration of the mhz band may be applied against the billion obligation  subject to approval by the ta under the report and order 
because the final reconciliation and audit of the entire reconfiguration obligation outlined in the report and order will not take place until after the completion of all aspects of the reconfiguration process  there can be no assurance that we will be given full credit for the expenditures that we have incurred under the report and order 
additionally  since we  the ta and the fcc have not yet reached an agreement on the methodology for calculating certain amounts of property  plant and equipment to be submitted for credit associated with reconfiguration activity related to our own network  we cannot provide assurance that we will be granted full credit for certain of these network costs 
however we believe that if we are successful in our appeal of the third mo o  we estimate  based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available  that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfiguration will range between billion and billion 
this estimate is dependent on significant assumptions including the final licensee costs  and costs associated with relocating licensees in the canadian and mexican border regions for which there are currently no approved border plans 
in addition  depending on the outcome of our discussions with the ta regarding the calculation of the credit for our internal network costs  our total approved costs would increase 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
in addition  we are entitled to receive reimbursement from the mobile satellite service licensees for their pro rata portion of our costs of clearing a portion of the ghz spectrum 
those licensees may be unable or unwilling to reimburse us for their share of the costs  which we estimate to be approximately million 
if we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the third mo o  we anticipate that our costs could exceed billion  by an amount that would likely be material 
however  we believe that it is unlikely we will be required to make a payment to the us treasury 
from the inception of the program and through december   we have incurred approximately billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program 
this amount does not include any of our apportioned 
table of contents internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program 
purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them 
they include agreements for access and backhaul and customer billing services  advertising services and contracts related to information technology and customer care outsourcing arrangements 
amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted  subscribers and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes about billion of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified 
no time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding 
as a result  they are not firm commitments 
our liability for uncertain tax positions was million as of december  due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions  it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular years in the table 
off balance sheet financing we do not participate in  or secure  financings for any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
future outlook we expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs for at least the next months by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand  and or the billion of cash that we drew down under our revolving credit facility on february   as well as any remaining cash available under the facility 
in making this assessment  we have considered anticipated levels of capital expenditures and fcc license acquisitions  including funding required in connection with the deployment of next generation technologies and our next generation broadband wireless network  anticipated payments under the report and order  as supplemented  scheduled debt service requirements  and other future contractual obligations 
if there are material changes in our business plans  or currently prevailing or anticipated economic conditions in any of our markets or competitive practices in the mobile wireless communications industry  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow or profitability  anticipated cash needs could change significantly 
the conclusion that we expect to meet our funding needs for at least the next months as described above does not take into account any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum acquisition strategies  
table of contents potential material purchases or redemptions of our outstanding debt securities for cash  and potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources  including existing cash on hand and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility 
if existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs  it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of additional factors that cannot currently be predicted with certainty  including the commercial success of our operations  the volatility and demand of the capital markets  the market prices of our securities  and tax law restrictions related to the spin off of embarq that may limit our ability to raise capital from the sale of our equity securities 
we have in the past and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential sources of new capital to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
at present  other than the existing arrangements that have been described in this report  we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of additional capital 
the above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under forward looking statements and part i  item a risk factors in this report 
financial strategies general risk management policies we primarily use derivative instruments for hedging and risk management purposes 
hedging activities may be done for various purposes  including  but not limited to  mitigating the risks associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes  credit support agreements  continual review and monitoring of all counterparties  and thorough legal review of contracts 
we also control exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits 
our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions  and all transactions comply with the policy 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments  usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign currencies  and equity prices 
the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
specific interest rate risk include the risk of increasing interest rates on short term debt  the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings  and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned refinancings using long term fixed rate debt 

table of contents cash flow hedges we enter into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by effectively converting a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest rate cash flow hedges 
fair value hedges we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate movements and achieve an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk 
the interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively convert our fixed rate debt to a floating rate by receiving fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
as of december   we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements that were designated as fair value hedges 
about of our debt as of december  was fixed rate debt excluding interest rate swaps 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
as of december   we held fair value interest rate swaps with a notional value of billion 
these swaps were entered into as hedges of the fair value of a portion of our senior notes 
these interest rate swaps have maturities ranging from to on a semiannual basis  we pay a floating rate of interest equal to the six month libor plus a fixed spread and receive an average interest rate equal to the coupon rates stated on the underlying senior notes 
on december   the rate we would pay averaged and the rate we would receive was 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the prevailing forward yield curve  the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying senior notes would change by million 
these interest rate swaps met all the requirements for perfect effectiveness under derivative accounting rules as all of the critical terms of the swaps perfectly matched the corresponding terms of the hedged debt  therefore  there is no net effect to earnings and cash flows for any fair value fluctuations 
we perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt including interest rate swaps 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows as of december  while our variable rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair values 
we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in the fair market value of our debt to billion 
this analysis includes the hedged debt 
foreign currency risk we also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow 
we use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was million as of december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant 

table of contents equity risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate 
these securities  which are classified in investments and marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets  include equity method investments  investments in private securities  available for sale securities and equity derivative instruments 
additional information regarding our derivative instruments can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in certain business transactions  we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates 
these warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments
