item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  reported for the year ended  a decline of  or 
however  the prior year s net income includes a non recurring  pre tax and  after tax gain resulting largely from the sale of the bank s former main office building in june adjusting the prior year to exclude this non recurring item results in comparable net income of  making the decline  or 
year to date diluted earnings per share was versus the prior year s reported  again however  after adjustment for the nonrecurring gains  the diluted earnings per share would be  making the decline 
the return on assets for the year was compared to the reported and adjusted in the return on shareholders equity was compared to the reported and adjusted in notwithstanding the nonrecurring pre tax sales gain of  the decline in net income is principally a function of net interest margin compression  the resumption of a provision for loan loss expense  and growth in non interest expenses 
given the significant competition for retail deposits in our markets  coupled with a yield curve that was inverted out to five years  and essentially flat from five out to thirty years  at the beginning of  the continuation of a period  that began in june  of no interest rate adjustments by the federal reserve through september  whereupon the federal reserve began to cut interest rates through the end of the year 
as a result  the cost of funding asset growth increased more than did income on earning assets 
this is due largely to the company s asset sensitivity  and reliance on higher cost retail certificates of deposit and borrowings  coupled with significant growth in loans versus a slowing of deposit growth  requiring increased borrowings and combing to cause total interest expense to increase more than total interest income 
as a result the company s net interest income declined by  and the net interest margin accordingly declined from for the year  to for the year there was  in loan loss expense in versus none in the prior year  and there was an increase of  in total non interest expense

at december   the book value of a share of common stock was versus in net income for the year ended december  increased by  or  ending the year at  compared to  in the increase was due to a combination of a nonrecurring pre tax gain of  principally from the sale of the company s former main office branch reflected in other income  and an increase in net interest income  the latter of which increased by  or to million versus million in largely as a result of the increases in interest rates throughout the year and to a lesser extent  the increase in volume of loans and investment securities 
total interest income increased by million or to million from million in  as the company s average interest earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities  increased by million  or from december  interest expense on deposits and borrowings also increased by million  or  ending the year at million from million in the increase in interest expense principally resulted from increases in interest rates on retail deposits primarily certificates of deposit  and wholesale borrowings  as well as growth in the volume of interest bearing deposits 
the average balances of interest bearing deposits increased by million or to average million for the year  versus million for the year total other non interest income totaled million  an increase of  or versus million in the increase is principally due to  increase in deposit fees and charges due to a new overdraft protection program introduced in late fourth quarter  and a  non recurring gain from the sale of the former main office building in the second quarter non interest expense increased to million an increase of million or compared to million in of total non interest expense  salaries and benefits comprised over and totaled million up by  or over million in occupancy and equipment expenses have increased due to the general growth of the bank  and the full year of occupancy expense associated with the new main office in versus only six months in advertising and public relations expense has increased due to the new marketing and product promotion programs begun in in conjunction with our emphasis on business development 
basic earnings per share were in compared to the reported adjusted for the non recurring gain on sale in and in diluted earnings per share were in  adjusted for the non recurring gain on sale in  and in all per share amounts presented have been adjusted giving effect to the stock dividend paid june  the company s return on average equity was in  adjusted for the non recurring gain on sale in and in while the return on average assets amounted to in  adjusted for the non recurring gain on sale in  in net interest income 
in the company s net interest income was  compared to  in  and  in as discussed above  the principal reason for the decline in the net interest margin in from was margin compression 
the lower net interest income for was anticipated  and is reflected in the basis point decline in the net interest margin due to the company s asset sensitivity and the current interest rate environment 
following a period of stable rates throughout the first  second and most of the third quarter of  the federal reserve made three cuts in rates totaling basis points  causing interest income to decline by a higher percentage than the percentage decline in our interest expense  resulting in compression of our net interest margin 
this compression is further exacerbated by the company s asset sensitivity  as there are more earning assets tied to variable interest rates than there are variable rate deposits or borrowings 
for example the cost of interest paid on certificates of deposit  the company s most significant funding source  does not immediately decline when interest rates are cut  whereas the income on loans tied to prime or other variable indices does 
some of the margin compression effect was mitigated by the increases in the volume of earning assets  principally loans 
earning assets for averaged  an increase of  or compared to  in the decrease in net interest income for versus of  or resulted from the increase of  or in interest income which totaled  versus  in  being exceeded by the increase of  or in interest expense which totaled  versus  in in spite of the million increase in the average volume of earning assets  due to the flat rate environment over the first three quarters followed by interest rate cuts in the fourth quarter  the yield on earning assets increased by only basis points to from the prior year s  while over the same period  the expense yield on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points to from in this situation where yields increased more on interest bearing liabilities than they did on earning assets results from late year interest rate cuts following a period of flat rates in a competitive environment where the costs of deposits continues to increase as older low rate certificates of deposit renew at higher current rates at an asset sensitive financial institution 
the company s net interest income for was up  or compared to  in the increase over was a result of the stabilization of interest rates in the second half of following four basis point increases by the federal reserve earlier that year between january and june 
the company s asset sensitivity  during a period of rising interest rates  coupled with increases in the volume of earning assets  generally results in increasing net interest income 
the improvement in net interest income for versus of is due to an increase of in interest income which totaled  driven by a million or increase in the average balance of earning assets which averaged million in and the impact of interest rate increases early in the year resulting in a basis point yield improvement to from in correspondingly  interest expense on interest bearing liabilities increased as well  growing by to total  due to a million or increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the expense yield on average interest bearing liabilities  increased by basis points to for the year  compared to in the prior year 
the fact that the yields increased more on interest bearing liabilities than it did on earning assets is reflective of the lagging effect of a stable rate environment following a period of steady increases to an asset sensitive financial institution 
the cost of funds continues to increase as lower rate time deposits automatically renew at the current higher interest rates 
the table below  sets forth the company s average interest earning assets on a tax equivalent basis and average interest bearing liabilities  the average yields earned on such assets and rates paid on such liabilities  and the net interest margin  all for the periods indicated

net interest income when adjusted for the effect of non taxable income is referred to as fully tax equivalent fte net interest income 
on a fully tax equivalent basis  net interest income for was  a decline of  or versus  million in  whereas fte net interest income in increased by  or from  in the full year fte net interest margin was compared to for the full year of and in the tax equivalent net interest margin is a measure of net interest income performance 
it represents the difference between interest income with any non taxable interest adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis  including net deferred loan fees earned  and interest expense  on both deposits  and borrowings reflected as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
comparing with  the fte net interest income contracted by  and the fte net interest margin declined to from  primarily due to margin compression 
the yield on total earning assets increased by only basis points  to from on million more in earning assets  and resulted largely from the increase in the yield on loans versus  on an increase in loan volume of million million from million  while the yield on securities was basically unchanged at versus on an increase of million in volume million from million 
correspondingly  the cost of total interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from  on an increase in interest bearing liabilities volume of million from million  and resulted from the increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits of basis points from  on an increase in volume of million million from million  while borrowings cost declined by basis points from  on million higher volume million from million 
by contrast  when comparing to  the fte net interest income increased by  versus the prior year  however the fte net interest margin actually declined to from 
despite the rate earned on earning assets increasing basis points vs 
 and the average volume of earning assets increasing by million million vs 
million  the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by a greater increment  basis points vs 
and although coupled with a smaller increase of million in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities million vs 
million  still resulted in the tax equivalent net interest margin being lower than the prior year 
again  a classic example of margin compression 
the tax equivalent yield on securities in was  a one basis point increase over the yield in the yield was maintained due to the purchase of higher coupon callable us government agency securities with one or more years of call protection  in anticipation of future lower interest rates 
in view of the interest rate environment in late the company avoided much of the initial impact of higher coupon securities being called and replaced with lower coupon securities whose yields are in line with the new lower market interest rates 
this strategy maintained the portfolio yield despite the increasing number of higher coupon bonds called in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the decline in market rates 
per the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec uniform bank performance report the company s investment securities yield ranked in the th percentile of its  peer banks for the tax equivalent yield on securities in was a basis point increase over the yield in and slightly better than the yield in this increase is largely attributable to the acquisition of higher coupon agency securities as rates continued to edge up through the first half of in mid  the federal reserve stopped increasing interest rates 
this stabilization continued through the end of the year  and given the longer term orientation of the total portfolio  has allowed the purchase of higher coupon bonds 
the company  due to the composition of its investment portfolio  has continued to maintain its yield at a level considerably better than of its  peer institutions  as evidenced by the ffiec uniform bank performance report for net interest income is affected by changes in both average interest rates and average volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

deposit fees and charges were  compared to  a slight decline of due in large part to no significant change in the volume of overdrafts and no increases in deposit service charges 
bank card fees were  a increase over the prior year s  the higher revenue was due to the increasing volume of debit card usage  point of sale transaction fees  and interchange credits 
the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance totaled  versus  an increase of  or as a result of an additional investment of approximately million in bank owned life insurance early in  to provide coverage for officers employed since the initial purchases in  coupled with higher net crediting rates on prior investments 
mortgage loan secondary market fees declined significantly due to the strategy of recording on the bank s books a percentage of mortgages underwritten rather than selling them in the secondary market  coupled with the beginning of a decline in the mortgage origination business generally

bank card fees in were up  or to total  for the year due to higher interchange credit and increased debit card transaction fees 
secondary market mortgage loan interest and fees in were  up  or from the prior year 
the lower growth in this category is due to the general slow down in real estate loan originations  coupled with the absence of any significant loan refinancing volume resulting from the relatively flat interest rate environment 
total other non interest income in totaled  an increase of or  due to the combination of higher check fees  miscellaneous income  and title insurance income 
realized gains on securities available for sale in totaled  down  or compared to  for these non recurring net gains were as a result of active portfolio management  however a lower volume of such transactions occurred in due in part to a lesser need for funding and the use of other temporary funding sources

non interest expenses 
total non interest expense was  versus  in the prior year  an increase of  or from the categories with the most significant increases or decreases were  salaries and wages which increased by  or totaling  compared to  due to normal staff salary increases  as overall staffing levels remained at or below the prior year  pensions and other employee benefits  which increased by  or totaling  compared to  and reflecting continued improvements in general benefits  legal and professional fees  which increased by  or totaling  versus  principally due to the costs directly related to implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  plus general increases in accounting and legal fees  advertising and public relations increased  or to  versus  in reflective of the company s continued emphasis on sales  growth of our core business  and general market awareness  equipment depreciation expense declined  or totaling  compared to  due to lower levels of new asset purchases and previously booked assets becoming fully depreciated 
total non interest expenses increased by  or in and totaled  compared to  in the largest dollar increases over the prior year were in salaries and wages which increased  or and totaled  compared to  in employee benefits were up by  or totaling  versus  in these increases can be attributed to the additional lending and business development personnel hired  as well as the tightness in our market for experienced bank retail and support personnel hired as a result of normal turnover 
the company often finds that the cost of a replacement will be greater than the previous incumbent resulting in salaries expense increasing

the effective tax rate declined versus due to lower overall income before taxes  increased loan charge offs  the increase in non taxable growth of the cash value of bank owned life insurance resulting from the additional investment in early in versus the effective tax rate increased largely due to a consistently lower level of tax free municipal securities in the investment portfolio 
financial condition loan portfolio 
the company is an active residential mortgage and residential construction lender and generally extends commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses within its primary service area 
the company s commercial lending activity extends across its primary service area of powhatan  cumberland  eastern goochland county  western chesterfield  and western henrico counties 
consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  the company generally does not attempt to diversify its loan portfolio geographically by making significant amounts of loans to borrowers outside of its primary service area 
the principal economic risk associated with each of the categories of loans in the company s portfolio is the creditworthiness of its borrowers 
within each category  such risk is increased or decreased depending on prevailing economic conditions 
the risk associated with the real estate mortgage loans and installment loans to individuals varies based upon employment levels  consumer confidence  fluctuations in value of residential real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of consumers to repay indebtedness 
the risk associated with commercial  financial and agricultural loans varies based upon the strength and activity of the local economies of the company s market areas 
the risk associated with real estate construction loans varies based upon the supply of and demand for the type of real estate under construction 
many of the company s real estate construction loans are for pre sold or contract homes 
builders are limited as to the number and dollar amount of loans for speculative home construction based on the financial strength of the borrower and the prevailing market conditions 
net loans outstanding at december  had increased by million or ending the year at million as compared to the prior year

mortgage loans grew million or in  declined by million or in  grew by million or in  and grew by million or in the decline in was due largely to the previously mentioned slow down in the real estate market 
mortgage loans have comprised between to of the total real estate loans for the past five years 
mortgage loans to total real estate loans were in  in  in  in  and in home equity loans have grown steadily over the past five years from million in to million in  however  they still comprise approximately the same percentage of total real estate related loans 
home equity loans to total real estate loans were in  in  in  in  and in bankcard loan balances outstanding were thousand in  and have remained relatively level over the period from through ranging from a high of thousand in to a low of thousand in the shift from construction to mortgage loan growth was accomplished in part by the decision in early not to sell as many mortgage loans in the secondary market 
instead those loans which met the bank s underwriting criteria were recorded on the bank s books as mortgage loans 
in addition  most of these loans were and year fixed rate loans  which given the composition of bank s portfolio of mortgage loans being mostly and year adjustable rate loans  the addition of fixed rate loans was desirable from an asset liability standpoint at a time when interest rates were flat and expected to trend down in the future 
as a percentage of total real estate loans  construction loans comprised in  in  in  in  and in considering the current state of the real estate market for new home sales  the company does not anticipate that growth in construction loans will continue at the same rate in the future as it has in the past 
essentially all construction loans are for residential construction in the principal markets served by the company 
installment loans increased by thousand or in  declined by million or in  declined by thousand or in  but increased by thousand or in the balances of traditional installment loans increased in due to the company s emphasis on loan growth  however over the past several years  the balances have dropped principally due to the company s unwillingness to effectively compete on an interest rate basis with the captive and other finance arms of the major automobile manufacturers  coupled with the tendency of consumers to utilize equity credit lines for purposes that in the past would have been financed with traditional installment loans 
the company anticipates this atmosphere surrounding installment lending to continue in the future as long as the automobile manufacturers effectively subsidize the sale of vehicles through offering below market financing 
all concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans at december  were disclosed as a separate category of loans

non performing loans include non accrual loans  loans days or more past due and restructured loans 
non accrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued 
loans which reach non accrual status  per company policy  may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest has been paid  or the loan becomes both well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are loans with respect to which a borrower has been granted a concession on the interest rate or the original repayment terms because of financial difficulties 
non performing loans totaled  at december   versus  at december    at december    at december   and  at december  non performing loans increased by million in from due principally to the addition of loans for one customer totaling million being placed in non accrual status at december   combined with the million increase in loans days or more past due  largely resulting from our local economic slow down 
the vast majority of loans currently in non accrual are considered adequately secured by real estate and no significant losses are anticipated regardless of the resolution 
non performing loans increased by  in from primarily due to slight increases of  and  in non accrual loans and loans past due days or more past due respectively 
non performing loans increased by  in from due to an increase of  in non accruals and a decline of  in day past due loans 
while nonperforming loans declined by  in from due to non accrual loans increasing by  and day past due loans declining by at december  and  there were no other non performing assets 
a virginia small business financing authority industrial development revenue bond carried at december  at a value approximating its anticipated liquidation value of  was resolved in the third quarter the original principal investment was  and had been written down to  with its value further reduced by the company s receipt of its pro rata portion of the collateral property s lease payments 
management concluded the principal carrying value  was appropriate  accordingly  no additional write downs were made 
the matter was finally resolved upon the receipt of  from the sale of the collateral real estate 
the company thus recovered its total carrying value plus  of prior period write downs 
management forecloses on delinquent real estate loans when all other repayment possibilities have been exhausted 
there was no real estate acquired through foreclosure oreo at december     and  compared to  at december  as the bank has had no oreo  accordingly  it has no    or  period expenses related to oreo 
the bank s practice is to value real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lower of i an independent current appraisal or market analysis less anticipated costs of disposal  or ii the existing loan balance 
given the increase in non performing assets  management is concerned  however it does not believe that the level of non performing loans in is reflective of any significant systemic problem within the company s loan portfolio 
at december   there were  in non accrual loans compared to  in non accrual loans at december  and  at december    at december   and at december  based on our present knowledge of the status of individual and corporate borrowers and the overall state of the local economy  management reasonably anticipates that the level of non performing assets is likely to increase from its current level  however not by the same degree of increase experienced in over management will move to foreclose on borrowers whose loans are placed on a non accrual status in order to resolve the credit therefore it is reasonable to anticipate an increase in oreo 
the following table summarizes non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis loans contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments not included in non accrual loans above loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms not included in non accrual loans or loans contractually past due days or more above total non performing loans other real estate owned other non performing assets total non performing assets loans days or more past due generally  are placed on non accrual status unless well secured and in the process of collection 
the company s policy with respect to past due interest on nonaccrual loans requires that any interest accrued in the current year and unpaid should be reversed from the receivable and current year s income

the impact of both the reversal of previously accrued but unpaid interest plus the absence of subsequent accruals on loans in non accrual status had the effect of reducing net income by  in   in   in since the company operates in a rural to suburban area  it has generally been well acquainted with its principal borrowers and has not had such a large number of problem credits that management has not been able to stay well informed about  and in contact with  troubled borrowers 
management is not aware of any other material loans at december   which involve significant doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with their existing payment terms

loans  including non performing loans are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the company s periodic loan review process 
management reviews the adequacy of its loan loss allowance at the end of each month 
based primarily on the company s loan risk classification system  which classifies all commercial loans  including problem credits as substandard  doubtful  or loss  according to a scale of with being a loss  additional provisions for losses may be made monthly 
in addition  the company evaluates the general market credit risks inherent in lending  as well as any systemic issues  as part of its enhanced loan loss adequacy analysis 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at december   at december   at december   at december  and at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses  while not increasing at the same rate as the loan portfolio grows  is nevertheless adequate to provide for future losses 
at december   the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans was  at december  the ratio was  at december  the ratio was  at december  the ratio was  and at december  the ratio stood at 
management evaluates non performing loans relative to their collateral value and makes appropriate reductions in the carrying value of those loans based on that review

management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of local business and economic conditions  changes in the nature and value of the portfolio  industry standards and other relevant factors 
assumptions and factors considered by management in determining the amounts charged to operations include internally generated loan review reports  previous loan loss experience with the borrower  the status of past due interest and principal payments on the loan  the quality of financial information supplied by the borrower and the general financial condition of the borrower 
despite management s best efforts  the reserve may be adjusted in future periods if there are significant changes in the assumptions or factors utilized when making valuations  or conditions differ materially from the assumptions originally utilized 
any such adjustments are made in the reporting period when the relevant factor s become known and when applied as part of the analysis indicate a change in the level of potential loss is warranted

in the opinion of management  the provision charged to operations has been sufficient to absorb the current year s net loan losses while continuing to provide for potential future loan losses in view of a somewhat uncertain economy

the company has allocated the allowance according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within each of the above categories of loans 
the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future loss trends 
furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire portfolio 
securities the company s investment securities portfolio serves several purposes  primarily  liquidity  safety and yield 
certain of the securities are pledged to secure public deposits and others are specifically identified as collateral for borrowing from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  and others for repurchase agreements with correspondent banks and commercial customers 
the remaining portion of the portfolio is held for investment yield  availability for sale in the event liquidity is needed  and for general asset liability management purposes 
at year end december   total investment securities were million representing of total assets  and an increase of million or versus the year ended december  balance of million 
total investment securities at year end were largely unchanged at million or of total assets  as compared to the prior year s december  balance of million 
during  deposit growth slowed significantly ending up by only million  federal funds sold of million were combined with million increase in borrowings to fund net securities growth of million  loans held for sale of million  and loan growth of million  with the balance million split between other assets and other liabilities 
during the year purchases of securities totaled million while due to the declining rates in the latter part of the year  calls totaled million  sales were million  paydowns were million 
the net increase of this activity was million less the unrealized losses of million for the increase from year end to of the new purchases in  or million were us government agency  and or million were corporate securities 
maintaining total portfolio yield while permitting portfolio duration to lengthen slightly in the falling rate environment was the overall strategy 
during the year  the balance of total securities did not change materially as the million growth in retail deposits was more than sufficient to fund the million in loan growth  with the excess funding reflected as overnight federal funds sold of million at december  securities transactions in were limited to sales and purchases to enhance yields  and or to shorten duration 
during the year ended december   total securities decreased million  or  to million  or of total assets  principally due to the million  or  increase in loans 
the company  in the past  has increased its marketable securities holdings  if supported by solid deposit growth and or borrowings  particularly when experiencing lower loan growth  in an effort to increase net interest income 
it is anticipated that this practice will continue in the future 
the securities portfolio consists of two components  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
securities are classified as held to maturity when management has the intent and the company has the ability at the time of purchase to hold the securities to maturity 
securities so classified are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and accounted for at market value 
securities available for sale include securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs and other similar factors 
the company s purchases of securities are limited by policy to securities of investment grade credit quality with various maturities and many with optional call provisions 
the company reviews and evaluates all securities quarterly or more frequently as necessary for possible impairment 
if  in the judgment of management  there is serious doubt as to the probability of collecting substantially all the company s basis in a security within a reasonable period of time  an impairment write down will be recognized 
the company presently holds five corporate debt securities with credit ratings that  subsequent to purchase  have declined below minimum investment grade million  ford motor corporation maturing september  million  ford motor credit corporation maturing october  million  gmac maturing may  million  gmac maturing february  and million  deluxe corporation maturing october following the quarterly evaluation of these securities  management has concluded that  as of december  the impairment is considered temporary

the company s deposit base is comprised of demand deposits  savings and money market accounts and other time deposits 
the company s deposits are provided by individuals and businesses generally located within the principal markets served 
more recently  as the company has grown its earning assets  it has found it to be financially advantageous to rely to a greater extent on wholesale borrowings than retail deposits 
wholesale funding tends to be much easier to obtain  more reliable  and quite often cheaper than retail deposits 
since deposits are  for our purposes  functionally similar to other forms of borrowing  there is not a significant difference between retail deposits and wholesale borrowings in so far as funding sources for earning assets are concerned 
management will emphasize one or the other depending on the costs of each and its outlook as to the future direction of interest rates 
as shown in the following table  average total deposits grew by in  compared to in and in the average aggregate interest rate paid on deposits was in  versus in  and in the majority of the company s deposits are higher yielding time deposits because many of its customers are individuals who seek higher yields than those offered on savings and demand accounts

the following table is a summary of time deposits of  or more by remaining maturities at december  time deposits  dollars in thousands three months or less three to six months six to twelve months over twelve months capital resources the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings performance and changing competitive conditions and economic forces 
the company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support its growth and expansion activities  to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence 
the bank s capital position continues to exceed regulatory requirements 
the primary indicators relied on by the federal reserve board and other bank regulators in measuring strength of capital position are the tier capital  total capital  and leverage ratios 
tier capital consists of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity and minority interests in common equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
total capital consists of tier capital  qualifying subordinated debt  some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses and pre tax net unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  which consist of both on and off balance sheet risks 
the bank s tier capital ratio was as of december   compared to as of december   as of december   compared to at december  the total capital ratio was at december   compared to at december   at december   and at december  these ratios are in excess of the mandated minimum requirements of for tier  and for total 
the leverage ratio consists of tier capital divided by quarterly average assets 
at december  the bank s leverage ratio was compared to at december   at december  and at december  each of these exceeds the required minimum leverage ratio of 
the company  in view of the significant growth experienced over the past several years and the resulting impact on various capital ratios  recognized the need for additional capital to support further expansion or acquisitions and used the proceeds from the issuance of the million capital trust preferred securities in december to increase the capital position of the bank 
the following tables show risk based capital ratios and stockholders equity to total assets for the company and its principal subsidiary  central virginia bank december  regulatory minimum consolidated tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage ratio stockholders equity to total assets n a central virginia bank tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage ratio the capital management function is an ongoing process 
central to this process is internal equity generation accomplished by retaining earnings 
total stockholders equity decreased by million to million in from million principally due to an increase in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
by contrast  shareholders equity increased by million in as a result of earnings retention and a decrease in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in shareholders equity increased by million again due to earnings retention while partially offset by an increase in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at year end capital increased by million again primarily as the result of earnings retention and improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income

certain limitations exist under applicable law and regulation by regulatory agencies regarding dividend payments to a parent by its subsidiaries 
as of december   the bank had million of retained earnings available for distribution to the company as dividends without prior regulatory approval 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing within one year 
the company s ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates determines its liability liquidity 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and its ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
additional sources of liquidity available to the company include  but are not limited to  loan repayments  the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates  borrowing from the federal home loan bank  purchasing of federal funds from correspondent banks  and selling securities under repurchase agreements to correspondent banks as well as commercial customers 
to further meet its liquidity needs  the company also has access to the federal reserve system 
in the past  growth in deposits and proceeds from the maturity of investment securities has been sufficient to fund the net increase in loans 
the bank  over the past four years  has experienced growth in average year to date deposits from million in to million in during the same period  the bank has increased its borrowings from million ytd average for to million ytd average for 
del del 
interest rate sensitivity 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management must also control the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
managing this risk involves regular monitoring of the interest sensitive assets relative to interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
at december   the company had a positive month and a negative month period gap position  however the cumulative gap to the one year point was positive 
since the largest amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities mature or reprice within months  the company monitors this area closely 
the company does not emphasize interest sensitivity analysis beyond this time frame because it believes various unpredictable factors could result in erroneous interpretations 
early withdrawal of deposits  prepayments of loans and loan delinquencies are some of the factors that could have such an effect 
in addition  changes in rates on interest sensitive assets and liabilities may not be equal  which could result in a change in net interest margin 
while the company does not match each of its interest sensitive assets against specific interest sensitive liabilities  it does seek to enhance the net interest margin while minimizing exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
effects of inflation inflation significantly affects industries having high proportions of fixed assets or high levels of inventories 
although the company is not significantly affected in these areas  inflation does have an impact on the growth of assets 
as assets grow rapidly  it becomes necessary to increase equity capital at proportionate levels to maintain the appropriate equity to asset ratios 
traditionally  the company s earnings and high capital retention levels have enabled the company to meet these needs 
the company s reported earnings results have been affected by inflation  but isolating the effect is difficult 
the different types of income and expense are affected in various ways 
interest rates are affected by inflation  but the timing and magnitude of the changes may not coincide with changes in the consumer price index 
management actively monitors interest rate sensitivity  as illustrated by the gap analysis  in order to minimize the effects of inflationary trends on interest rates 
other areas of non interest expenses may be more directly affected by inflation

off balance sheet arrangements the company enters into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which would impact the company s liquidity and capital resources to the extent customer s accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies general 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we may use historical loss factors as one of the many factors and estimates utilized in determining the inherent losses that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
a summary of the significant accounting policies of the company is set forth in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
use of certain non gaap financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we have presented certain non gaap financial measures for the year ended december  throughout this form k  which are reconciled to gaap financial measures below 
we believe these non gaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the company s performance trends and facilitate comparisons with its peers 
specifically  we believe the exclusion of a non recurring significant gain recognized in a single accounting period permits a comparison of results for ongoing business operations 
it is on this basis that we assess the company s performance for and establish goals for future periods 
although we believe the non gaap financial measures presented in this form k enhance investors understandings of the company s performance  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap financial measures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general an important element of both earnings performance and liquidity is the management of our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within specific time intervals and the risks involved with them 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments in response to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee at the bank is comprised of the ceo  cfo  senior credit officer and an independent director  and is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposures to this risk 
our board of directors reviews the guidelines established by the committee 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of four complimentary modeling tools static gap analysis  dynamic gap simulation modeling  earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of the three simulation models measure changes under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap  which measures aggregate repricing values  is less utilized or relied upon  since it does not effectively capture or measure the optionality characteristics of earning assets and funding sources nor does it effectively measure the earnings impact of changes in volumes and mix of these components on us 
earnings simulation and economic value models  however  which more effectively reflect the earnings impact  are utilized by management on a regular basis 
earnings simulation analysis we use simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model utilized by the company calculates estimated earnings based on projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a more realistic analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model  including loan and deposit growth rates  are derived from seasonal trends and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project the yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are accounted for in the different rate scenarios 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income net interest income at risk on a month horizon using different rate scenarios as of december  there have been no material changes in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since this information was developed using december  data 
change in yield curve cumulative percentage change in net interest income cumulative dollar change in net interest income dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points base basis points basis points basis points economic value simulation we use economic value simulation to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities under different interest rate environments 
economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities 
the change in economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term repricing risk in the balance sheet 
the same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following chart reflects the change in net market value of equity  economic value of equity at risk  by using december  data  over different rate environments with a one year horizon 
change in yield curve cumulative percentage change in economic value of equity cumulative dollar change in economic value of equity dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points base basis points basis points basis points management of the interest sensitivity gap the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling investment securities  replacing an earning asset or funding liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
we evaluate interest rate risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease sensitivity risk 
these guidelines are based upon management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
our asset liability management committee reviews deposit pricing  changes in borrowed money  investment and trading activity  loan sale activities  liquidity levels and the company s overall interest sensitivity 
the actions of the committee are reported to the board of directors regularly 
the periodic monitoring of interest rate risk  investment and trading activity  deposit pricing  funding and liquidity  along with any other significant transactions are managed by the chief financial officer of the bank with input from other committee members 
the following table summarizes the company s dynamic gap model
