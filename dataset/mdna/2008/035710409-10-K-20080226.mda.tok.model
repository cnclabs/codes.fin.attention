item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a reit that owns and manages a portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our investment securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of investment securities and from dividends we receive from fidac 
fidac is our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary  and is a registered investment advisor that generates advisory and service fee income 
we acquired approximately million shares of common stock of chimera investment corporation  or chimera  for approximately million in connection with chimera s initial public offering on november  in addition to our investment  chimera raised net proceeds of approximately million in its initial public offering 
chimera is a newly formed  publicly traded  specialty finance company that invests in residential mortgage loans  residential mortgage backed securities  real estate related securities and various other asset classes 
chimera is externally managed by fidac and intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we also have a majority interest in an investment fund 
we are primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans collectively  mortgage backed securities 
we also invest in federal home loan bank fhlb  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and federal national mortgage association fnma debentures 
the mortgage backed securities and agency debentures are collectively referred to herein as investment securities 
under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to rated high quality mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
in addition  we may directly or indirectly invest part of this remaining of our assets in other types of securities  including without limitation  unrated debt  equity or derivative securities  to the extent consistent with our reit qualification requirements 
the derivative securities in which we invest may include securities representing the right to receive interest only or a disproportionately large amount of interest  as well as inverse floaters  which may have imbedded leverage as part of their structural characteristics 
we may acquire mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date  all of the mortgage backed securities that we have acquired have been backed by single family residential mortgage loans 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining our status as a reit is that we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations primarily depend on  among other things  our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our mortgage backed securities portfolio averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
the current situation in the sub prime mortgage sector  and the current weakness in the broader mortgage market  could adversely affect one or more of our lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with additional financing 
this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce liquidity 
if one or more major market participants fails  it could negatively impact the marketability of all fixed income securities  including government mortgage securities  and this could negatively impact the value of the securities in our portfolio  thus reducing its net book value 
furthermore  if many of our lenders are unwilling or unable to provide us with additional financing  we could be forced to sell our investment securities at an inopportune time when prices are depressed 
even with the current situation in the sub prime mortgage sector we do not anticipate having difficulty converting our assets to cash or extending financing term  due to the fact that our investment securities have an actual or implied aaa rating and principal payment is guaranteed

the following table presents the cpr experienced on our mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  we believe that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future 
for the purposes of computing ratios relating to equity measures  throughout this report  equity includes series b preferred stock  which has been treated under gaap as temporary equity 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
market valuation of investment securities all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market prices 
although we generally intend to hold most of our investment securities until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our investment securities as part our overall management of our portfolio 
accordingly  we are required to classify all of our investment securities as available for sale 
our policy is to obtain market values from independent sources 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
investments with unrealized losses are not considered other than temporarily impaired if the company has the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments 
unrealized losses on investment securities that are considered other than temporary  as measured by the amount of decline in fair value attributable to factors other than temporary  are recognized in income and the cost basis of the investment securities is adjusted 
interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the interest method 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  wall street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
repurchase agreements we finance the acquisition of our investment securities through the use of repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts  including accrued interest  as specified in the respective agreements 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit and intend to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code  with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company will not be subjected to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
the company and fidac have made a joint election to treat fidac as a taxable reit subsidiary 
as such  fidac is taxable as a domestic c corporation and subject to federal and state and local income taxes based upon its taxable income 
impairment of goodwill and intangibles the company s acquisition of fidac was accounted for using the purchase method 
the cost of fidac was allocated to the assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill 
goodwill and finite lived intangible assets are periodically reviewed for potential impairment 
this evaluation requires significant judgment 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments sfas  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and among other things  sfas i permits fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  ii clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas  iii establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  iv clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and v amends sfas to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas was effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued by the company after january  securitized interests which only contain an embedded derivative that is tied to the prepayment risk of the underlying prepayable financial assets and for which the investor does not control the right to accelerate the settlement of such financial assets are excluded under a scope exception adopted by the fasb 
none of the company s assets were subject to sfas as a result of this scope exception 
consequently  the company has continued to record changes in the market value of its investment securities through other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
therefore  the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  and related implementation issues 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin was effective for the company on january  there was no impact to the company s financial statements from implementing this new standard 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas requires companies to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy ie  levels   and  as defined 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level category the valuation of which require significant management judgment  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for the company on january  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations  the manner in which it estimates fair value  but expects that adoption will increase footnote disclosure to comply with sfas disclosure requirements for financials statements issued after january  in february  the fasb issued sfas no  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas is effective for the company commencing january  the company is not expecting sfas to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the company did not elect the fair value option for any existing eligible financial instruments 
proposed fasb staff position the fasb issued a proposed fasb staff position fsp fas no 
d relating to fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase financing transactions to address situations where assets purchased from a particular counterparty and financed through a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty can be considered and accounted for as separate transactions 
currently  the company records such assets and the related financing on a gross basis in the consolidated statement of financial condition  and the corresponding interest income and interest expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
for assets representing available for sale investment securities  as in the company s case  any change in fair value is reported through other comprehensive income under sfas  with the exception of impairment losses  which are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income as realized losses 
fasb s proposed staff position requires that all of the following criteria be met in order to continue the application of sfas as described above the initial transfer of and repurchase financing cannot be contractually contingent  the repurchase financing entered into between the parties provides full recourse to the transferee and the repurchase price is fixed  the financial asset is readily obtainable in the marketplace and the transfer is executed at market rates  the borrower maintains the right to the collateral and the lender cannot re pledge the asset prior to settlement of the repurchase agreement  and the repurchase agreement and financial asset do not mature simultaneously 
at this time  the company believes that its purchases and subsequent financing through repurchase agreements with the same counterparty meet the criteria enumerated in the proposed fsp fas no 
d for treatment as a non linked transfer and repurchase under sfas and the company believes that if the fsp is ultimately issued in substantially its current form  there will be no effect on the manner in which the company records such assets  their financings  and the corresponding interest income and interest expense 
fsp fas d may be subject to significant changes prior to finalization  which may impact the company s current assessment of its impact

the rebalancing was done with the objective of improving future financial performance 
a positive difference between the sale price and the historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities is a realized gain and increases income accordingly

these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with lenders in amounts which we believe are in excess of our needs 
all of our investment securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years 
additionally  we have entered into structured borrowings giving the counterparty the right to call the balance prior to maturity 
the weighted average original term to maturity of our borrowings was days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was  with the effect of the interest rate swaps  and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days

at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional investment securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our investment securities varies 
our non cash assets are largely actual or implied aaa assets  and accordingly  we have not had  nor do we anticipate having  difficulty in converting our assets to cash 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our investment securities could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements increased by billion to billion at december   from billion at december  the increase in borrowings was the result of our deployment of additional capital raised during  which permitted us to increase our borrowings 
we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of investment securities increases due to changes in market interest rates of market factors  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of the our mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such mortgage backed securities and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mortgage backed securities generally due to principal reduction of such mortgage backed securities from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position

unrealized gains and losses with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
by accounting for our assets in this manner  we hope to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities  available for sale equity securities and interest rate swaps in our portfolio

unrealized changes in the estimated net market value of investment securities have one direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our investment securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
leverage our debt to equity ratio at december   and was  and  respectively 
we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of investment securities by entering into interest rate swaps 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
at december   we entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
we may enter into similar derivative transactions in the future by entering into interest rate collars  caps or floors or purchasing interest only securities 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
capital resources at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends are based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that at least of our assets were qualified reit assets  as defined in the code for the years ended december  and we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the years ended december  and consequently  we met the reit income and asset test 
we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  for the years ended of december    and  we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests and at least of our assets in qualifying interests plus other real estate related assets 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securities represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december  and december   we were in compliance with this requirement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our mortgage backed securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors  inverse floaters and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio including interest rate swaps may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income  portfolio value should interest rates go up or down   and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and does include the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially based on actual prepayment experience

our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report
