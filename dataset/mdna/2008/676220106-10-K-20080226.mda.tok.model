item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general our fiscal year results are based on a or week retail calendar ending on the last saturday in december 
fiscal year is based on weeks  with a week fourth quarter 
our comparable store sales or comp sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year 
for  this comparison has been adjusted to a week basis 
restatement of financial statements on october   we announced that our audit committee initiated an independent review principally focused on the accounting for certain vendor program funds 
the review  which arose from a whistleblower complaint  was conducted with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic accountants 
the investigation revealed errors in the timing of recognition of certain vendor program funds 
the impact of these errors was to reduce previously reported gross profit  operating profit  net earnings and earnings per share in fiscal and the first two quarters of and defer recognition into future periods 
additionally  inventories and tax accounts were adjusted on the consolidated balance sheet related to these deferrals 
on november   the board of directors of the company approved a decision to restate our financial statements including corrections to amounts previously reported in the third and fourth quarters of and the interim financial statements for the first and second quarters of on november   we amended our previously filed form k for the fiscal year and our previously filed forms q for the first and second quarters of the financial statements and related disclosures for the period ended september  were restated to reflect the impact of the errors discussed above in our form q for the quarter ended september   which was also filed on november  our amended reports reflect a reduction in diluted earnings per share of in the quarter ended september   in the quarter ended december   in the quarter ended march   and in the quarter ended june  as compared to amounts previously reported 
because of rounding and changes in share count  the diluted eps impact over the period aggregates to for fiscal year and a total of per share over the period from the third quarter of through the second quarter of the future impact of the deferrals related to one period were considered in determining net deferrals in subsequent periods 
the net deferral became a positive impact beginning in the later part of and extending through the years from through the financial restatements resulted in reductions of previously reported company gross profit of approximately million in the quarter ended september   million in the quarter ended december  an aggregate of million for fiscal year  million in the quarter ended march   and million in the quarter ended june  approximately million of the amount deferred at the end of the third quarter of reversed in the fourth quarter of and remaining amounts will reverse in the years through these restatements related to non cash items and the reduction in net earnings was offset in the consolidated statement of cash flows by a change in working capital and other items such that net cash provided by operating activities did not change for the periods restated 
the primary impact to the balance sheet was to reduce inventories by the amounts deferred and to increase short term deferred tax assets for the tax impacts of the change in pre tax earnings 
overview our business is comprised of three reportable segments 
the north american retail division includes our retail office supply stores in the us and canada  which offer office supplies  computers and business machines and related supplies  and office furniture 
most stores also offer a design  print and ship center offering graphic design  printing  reproduction  mailing and shipping 
the north american business solutions division sells office supply products and services in the us and canada directly to businesses through catalogs  internet web sites and a dedicated sales force 
our international division sells office products and services through catalogs  internet web sites  a dedicated sales force and retail stores 
evidence of a softening in business spending began to impact our results in the first quarter of  particularly in our sales to small and medium sized businesses 
this continued into the second quarter as declines in construction spending  higher fuel prices and softness in the housing market were seen as macroeconomic factors adversely affecting our sales 
by the third quarter  a downturn related to housing became particularly apparent in florida and california regions where we have many stores and delivery customers 
and  in the fourth quarter  negative housing and credit market impacts had broadened 
throughout this period  we continuously adjusted our business to cope with these factors 
we slowed our inventory purchases which in turn resulted in a significant decrease in vendor program funds recognized in the fourth quarter 
we managed inventory purchases and engaged in 
table of contents inventory clearance activities to mitigate risk and recognized additional loss provisions as necessary 
in the us delivery business  we added contract customers  but this resulted in a higher mix of customers with lower margin sales 
internationally  we experienced a decline in sales and profitability in our uk business  historically  the most significant market for us in europe 
in addition to certain business transitional issues  the decline was also influenced by economic factors in that country 
we have put in place actions to mitigate this influence 
despite these negative influences  we executed a number of initiatives that are key to our long term strategy 
we increased private brand penetration across the company and continued to focus on ways to streamline operations while also improving customer satisfaction 
we increased store count in north america and continued our store remodel program 
we also opened regional offices to support our global business expansion 
we anticipate continued negative impacts from macroeconomic trends during  including declines in sales and margins compared to a year ago 
a summary of factors important to understanding our results for is provided below and further discussed in the narrative that follows this overview 
total company sales increased to billion in  up compared to sales in the north american retail division were flat for the year  with comparable store sales down 
sales in the north american business solutions division decreased by compared to international division sales increased in us dollars and in local currencies 
gross margin for declined basis points from  primarily in response to promotional activities as well as shifts in product and customer mix 
as part of our previously announced streamlining activities charges  we recorded approximately million  million and million of pretax charges in  and  respectively 
total operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately basis points in this decrease primarily reflects a change between periods of approximately million  or basis points  from lower performance based variable pay attributable to reduced operating results 
additionally  operating expenses as a percentage of sales reflects lower advertising expenses and charges  offset by higher supply chain and infrastructure costs 
our effective tax rate for was  reflecting an operating rate of approximately  reduced by favorability from certain discrete items including the impact of an international law change in the fourth quarter 
the operating rate for was approximately 
we currently expect our operating effective tax rate for to be about 
diluted earnings per share for  and were  and  respectively 
the charges had a per share impact of  and in  and  respectively 
cash flow from operating activities was million in  compared million in  primarily reflecting a reduction in operating results  coupled with an increase in working capital requirements in the current year 
under plans approved by our board of directors  we acquired million shares of our common stock during the first half of the year 
operating results our overall sales increased in and in however  was a week year based on our fiscal calendar 
the sales growth in is entirely attributable to increased sales in our international division  which benefited from strong sales in the contract channel as well as positive foreign currency impacts 
sales levels in our north american businesses were negatively impacted by a downturn in the us economy 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects the impact of a highly promotional environment  a shift in category mix to lower margin products  a shift in customer mix  inventory clearance activities  and cost increases 
these negative factors were partially offset by increased private brand penetration 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in reflects the net impact of higher private brand sales and better category management  partially offset by customer mix and promotional activity in certain areas and some change in product sales mix 
total store and warehouse operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in both and the decrease resulted primarily from lower performance based pay across all of our divisions in response to lower operating results 
lower advertising costs and pre opening expenses also contributed to the decrease in operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales 
these positive impacts were partially offset by higher selling expenses and supply chain costs  as well as investments made to support growth initiatives in our international division 
the decrease reflects operational efficiencies and sales leverage  partially offset by higher costs from accelerated store remodel and new store opening activities  as well as initial costs for an expanded sales force and the integration of several acquisitions during the year 
the  and totals of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses include charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
discussion of other income and expense items  including the charges and changes in interest and taxes follows our review of the operating segments 

table of contents north american retail division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales total sales in the north american retail division were essentially flat at billion in and increased in compared to sales in increased over after consideration of the impact of the additional week in  which increased division sales by approximately million 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased 
despite our new store openings in  a reduction in comparable store sales across all product lines resulted in minimal growth in total sales for this division 
the comparable store sales decline in was primarily driven by the macroeconomic environment  which grew increasingly challenging as the year progressed 
softness in the us housing market resulted in weaker small business and consumer spending  particularly in florida and california  which combined  represented approximately of division sales in comparable store sales in were also negatively impacted by cannibalization from new store build out  competitive intrusion and private brand penetration 
these factors were slightly offset by strong performance in our design  print and ship business  which experienced comparable store sales growth during the year 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year increased 
the improvement in division sales in primarily resulted from new store openings during the year  as well as improved selling efforts and effective merchandising and marketing programs 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased basis points in and increased basis points in the decrease in operating margins in primarily resulted from negative impacts of approximately basis points from declining product margins  which were driven by increased promotional activities and a shift in category mix 
although flat for the full year of  we also experienced a significant decrease in vendor program funds in the second half of the year from reduced purchasing levels and as vendors experienced slowdown in their own businesses 
average order value increased during  but the number of transactions decreased reflecting reduced traffic as economic conditions slowed 
operating margin was further impacted by approximately basis points from a de leveraging of fixed property costs and basis points from higher supply chain costs 
additionally  we experienced higher levels of inventory shrink  which had a negative impact on operating margin of approximately basis points 
partially offsetting these factors  we expanded our selection of private brands which had a positive impact on operating margins in private brand penetration also positively impacted operating margins in our operating expenses as a percentage of sales were lower in and compared to the prior year 
the decrease totaled approximately basis points and reflects a reduction in advertising costs as well as lower performance based variable pay commensurate with lower division performance and lower pre opening expenses related to a reduction in new store openings 
the decrease was attributable primarily to lower store operating costs  partially offset by increased advertising and pre opening expenses 
the store expansion and remodel program has impacted our operating expenses by additional pre opening expenses related to new stores  as well as accelerating depreciation for stores being remodeled and incurring non capitalizable remodeling costs 
we exclude the brief remodel period from our comp sales calculation to partially account for the disruption 
as we look into  we believe the uncertain economic outlook will challenge our sales and operating profit margin 
we opened new stores during and stores during  all using our m store design 
at the end of  we operated  retail stores in the us and canada 
we anticipate opening approximately stores in we also remodeled stores during and stores in we have a goal of remodeling substantially all remaining stores over the next few years 
north american business solutions division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales 
table of contents sales in our north american business solutions division decreased in and increased in both and the decrease reflects an reduction in sales from the direct channel  partially offset by sales increases in large and national account customers in the contract channel 
sales in increased over after considering the impact of the additional week in  which increased division sales by approximately million 
the sales increase in reflects organic growth in our contract sales channel  as well as the impact of an acquisition completed in mid may during  we began offering a combined catalog to the previously separate office depot and viking catalog customers and completed that integration in as expected  direct channel sales were lower in and following the conversion as we eliminated catalog duplications to create synergies and deliberately eliminated some unprofitable business 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased basis points in and basis points in operating margin in was negatively impacted by basis points from a combination of higher incentives offered to large and national account customers  a shift in the sales mix to lower margin customers and products  net cost increases that were not fully passed along to our customers  lower vendor rebate funds  and to a lesser degree  higher inventory clearance charges 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased approximately basis points in  reflecting de leveraging of division fixed costs  somewhat higher selling costs  and costs associated with certain unprofitable contracts partially offset by lower advertising expenses and lower performance based variable pay resulting from lower division performance 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased during the second half of as operational programs put in place during became established and as we adjusted our sales headcount in line with the sales softness during that period 
operating margin declined in compared to  reflecting paper cost increases and a higher mix of contract business  partially offset by additional private brand offerings 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in from our investment in additional sales personnel  as well as short term costs related to the integration of a contract business acquired during the year and the outsourcing of telephone account management and a new delivery initiative 
during  our lower delivery expenses were partially offset by higher fuel costs 
during  we anticipate continued negative margin impacts  partially offset by continued positive operating expense comparisons as we benefit from operational actions taken in international division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our international division increased in  in and declined in local currency sales increased in and in after considering the impact of the additional week in  which increased division sales by approximately million 
the contract channel displayed the strongest performance by increasing sales in local currencies by in local currency sales in the direct channel were slightly negative  reflecting a decline in our business in the uk 
the uk historically has accounted for about a third of division sales and about half of division operating profit 
during the second half of  the operating profit contribution of the uk decreased significantly 
we see continuing signs of an economic slowdown in the uk  which  if it persists  could provide additional challenges to our operations 
we have identified some controllable issues to improve delivery service levels which we expect will mitigate performance risks in the uk 
the retail channel  while a smaller part of our offering in this division  increased sales in local currencies 
the increase in sales in reflects improved performance in all channels and the impact of acquisitions 
during  we acquired all or a majority interest in entities headquartered in south korea  the czech republic and china  and increased our previous investment to a majority position in an entity in israel 
results of those entities have been consolidated in our financial statements since the dates of acquisition 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased basis points in and increased basis points in the decrease reflects lower performance of approximately basis points  primarily from the uk  and to a lesser extent  a greater percentage of contract sales in our sales mix 
to support growth initiatives  the division has established regional offices in asia and latin america  centralized certain support functions in europe  expanded into poland and consolidated certain warehouse facilities 
while these investments are expected to provide operating margin expansion over the longer term  they lowered operating margin by approximately basis points 
partially offsetting the decrease in operating margin in were positive impacts totaling approximately basis points  which resulted primarily from lower performance based variable pay as a result of lower division performance 
the increase in operating profit reflects primarily operational efficiencies from streamlining activities initiated in and continuing in the addition of lower margin business  as well as an increase in the relative proportion of contract sales in was partially offset by increased private brand sales 
during  we increased the size of our contract sales force across europe and increased the use of telephone account managers to drive account penetration 

table of contents for us reporting  the international division s sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
the division s reported sales were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates in by million and in by million 
division operating profit was also positively impacted from changes in foreign exchange rates by million in and million in internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 
barring a change in economic conditions  we expect continued challenges in the first half of  with stronger performance in the second half of the year as we anticipate improvement in the uk and as we more fully realize the benefits of the investments we have made in our businesses in europe and asia 
corporate and other asset impairments  exit costs and other charges during the third quarter of  we announced a number of material charges relating to asset impairments  exit costs and other operating decisions 
this announcement followed a wide ranging assessment of assets and commitments which began in the second quarter of at the end of  we had recognized million of charges and estimated the total charges to be incurred through fiscal year would be approximately million 
we revised that estimate to approximately million at the end of in part because of current economic considerations  in  we reassessed the timing of implementation of certain projects  including the consolidation of warehouses and distribution centers in both north america and europe and the consolidation and outsourcing of our international call centers  and we delayed those actions 
accordingly  we currently estimate recognizing charges of million and million in and  respectively  bringing the program total to approximately million 
the expenses associated with these future activities will be recognized as the individual plans are implemented and the related accounting recognition criteria are met 
as with any estimate  the timing and amounts of these charges may change when projects are implemented  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may impact amounts reported in us dollars related to our foreign activities 
a summary of the charges and the line item presentation of these amounts in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings is as follows 
dollars in millions  except per share amounts amounts amounts amounts cost of goods sold and occupancy costs store and warehouse operating and selling expenses asset impairments general and administrative expenses total pre tax charges income tax effect after tax impact per share impact of the million pre tax charge recognized in  approximately million related to asset impairments  with approximately million of exit costs and approximately million of costs associated with termination agreements relating to contracts and surplus leases  accelerated amortization of software and depreciation of assets based on changes in estimated useful lives and the write off of certain property and inventory no longer used or useful based on this business review 
the asset impairment charge of million included million related to certain former kids r us kru retail store locations acquired in from toys r us  inc the performance of many of these locations did not meet initial projections to recover the initial asset base 
we also recognized a million in goodwill and other intangible asset charge related to our tech depot subsidiary 
a change in market conditions for technology products and a shift in that subsidiary s emphasis from consumer to business customers resulted in lowering our projected cash flows and goodwill was written down to estimated fair value 
also  as part of this business review and to streamline operations  we decided to migrate customers from the guilbert trade name to office depot 
the existing trade name intangible asset was tested for impairment and written down by approximately million to the amount that we estimated to be recoverable over the one year migration plan 

table of contents in addition to these significant asset impairment charges  we also recognized significant charges related to exit and other activities 
the total exit and other charges recorded in and anticipated for future periods will be discussed below  as well as where the charges appear in the consolidated statement of earnings 
we decided to close retail stores in north america and nine internationally  three warehouses two in north america and one internationally and consolidate certain international call center and contract operations 
accordingly  we recognized approximately million of charges for future lease obligations  severance related costs  accelerated depreciation  asset write offs and inventory clearance and disposal 
of this total  approximately million of inventory related costs were recognized in cost of goods sold  approximately million in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses and approximately million in general and administrative expenses

of this total  approximately million was presented as a charge in cost of goods sold  approximately million in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses and approximately million in general and administrative expenses 
we recognized million and million in and  respectively  associated with these projects as the previously identified plans were implemented and the related accounting recognition criteria were met 
we incurred charges for severance related expenses  accelerated depreciation and lease obligations associated with the consolidation of warehouses and distribution centers 
we also incurred severance related charges as plans were implemented for management restructuring and call center consolidation in europe 
some of these activities  such as planned facility closings  will extend into and the costs associated with these activities will be recognized in future periods as incurred  or in the case of asset utilization  over the period of remaining estimated useful life 
a summary of past and estimated future charges is presented below 
projected total dollars in millions actual actual actual charges asset impairments cost of goods sold asset write offs and accelerated depreciation lease obligations contract terminations one time termination benefits other associated costs total pre tax charges as with any estimate  the timing and amounts may change when projects are implemented 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may impact amounts reported in us dollars related to our foreign activities

general and administrative expenses dollars in millions general and administrative expenses of sales general and administrative g a expenses include charges of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally in  we recognized a charge of approximately million to resolve a wage and hour litigation in california 
after considering these charges and credits  the remaining change in total g a expenses in compared to reflects lower performance based pay commensurate with lower operating results  partially offsetting higher professional fees and outside labor costs 
the remaining change in total g a expenses in compared to reflects the positive impacts of various cost control measures and consolidating functions 

table of contents during  we decided to allocate to our divisions only those g a expenses that are directly or closely related to their operations 
those amounts are included in our determination of each division s operating profit 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
gain on sale of building in december  in connection with a decision to move to a new  leased  global headquarters near our current headquarters facility  we sold our corporate campus and entered into a leaseback agreement until construction of our new facility is complete 
the sale resulted in a gain of approximately million recognized in and million deferred over the leaseback period 
during  we recognized approximately million in amortization of the deferred gain on the sale 
this amortization largely offsets the rent expense during the leaseback period 
we have also entered into a longer term lease on the new facility that is expected to be available for occupancy at or about the end of for additional information on the lease of the new facility  see the contractual obligations subsection of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
other income and expense dollars in millions interest income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt miscellaneous income  net interest income remained relatively flat in  compared to the change in compared to reflects lower average cash balances  partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense increased for compared to  reflecting a higher level of short term borrowings 
our debt  including short and long term borrowings  net of cash and investments  at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of average net debt outstanding during was approximately million compared to million during  and this average may fluctuate in future periods with changes in working capital needs 
additionally  interest expense includes approximately million of incremental expense recorded in connection with reconciliations of amounts due under certain borrowings that are not expected to recur 
the increase in interest expense in compared to primarily results from the reduction of interest requirements following the favorable settlement of various tax claims 
the loss on extinguishment of debt in represents the million make whole payment related to settlement of the mortgage on our corporate campus that was sold during the year 
our net miscellaneous income consists of our earnings of joint venture investments  royalty and franchise income  gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions  and realized gains and impairments of other investments  if any 
the majority of miscellaneous income is attributable to equity in earnings from our joint venture in mexico  office depot de mexico 
the change in reflects higher joint venture earnings offset by foreign currency losses 
income taxes dollars in millions income taxes effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate decreased percentage points in compared to  primarily reflecting the impact from discrete benefits and current year valuation allowance changes  as well as the impact from a shift in the mix of pretax income  reflecting a higher proportion of international earnings taxed at lower rates 
our operational tax rates before discrete items and an international law change in the fourth quarter this year was approximately in and in the discrete items include a benefit of approximately million from the reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax position following a previously disclosed restructuring initiative and a local jurisdiction ruling that secured certain prior year filing positions 
additionally  we implemented a separate jurisdictional restructuring that will change the amount of income recognized in those jurisdictions  resulting in the future realization of existing net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  during the third quarter of  we eliminated the related valuation allowance of approximately million on deferred tax assets  as well as a related million impact recognized in 
table of contents the fourth quarter 
a change in foreign country law  which was enacted during the fourth quarter of  will result in realization of tax benefits from existing net operating loss carryforwards in that country and  accordingly  we eliminated the valuation allowance of approximately million on deferred tax assets 
also in  we recognized approximately million of net tax benefits from other valuation allowance changes and book to tax return adjustments 
we currently expect our operating effective tax rate for to be about 
however  the effective tax rate in future periods can be affected by variability in our mix of income  the tax rates in various jurisdictions  changes in the rules related to accounting for income taxes  outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process and our assessment of the need for accruals for uncertain tax positions  and therefore may be higher or lower than it has been over the past three years 
the effective income tax rate increased in  reflecting a greater impact in the prior year from closing certain worldwide tax audits and adjusted provisions for uncertain tax positions and a shift in mix of income from higher to lower tax jurisdictions 
during  we also adjusted certain valuation allowances based on our current assessment of realization of the related deferred tax assets 
this decrease was partially offset by additional tax expense from completing our plans to repatriate additional foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   we had approximately million in cash and equivalents and another million available under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate opening new stores in  and we expect to remodel substantially all remaining stores over the next few years 
we will also continue to make supply chain network improvements 
our primary needs for cash include working capital for operations  capital expenditures for new stores  store remodels  information technology projects and supply chain costs  and funds to service our debt obligations and make acquisitions 
we continually review our financing options 
although we currently anticipate that we will fund our operations  expansion and other activities through cash on hand  funds generated from operations  property and equipment leases and funds available under our existing credit facilities  we may consider alternative financing as appropriate for market conditions 
we hold cash throughout our service areas  but we principally manage our cash through regional headquarters in north america and europe 
we may move cash between those regions from time to time through short term transactions and have used these cash transfers at the end of fiscal quarterly periods to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities 
although such transfers and debt repayments took place at the end of and each of the first three quarters of  we completed a non taxable distribution to the us in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of the year  thereby permanently repatriating this cash 
additional distributions  including distributions of foreign earnings or changes in long term arrangements could result in significant additional us tax payments and income tax expense 
currently  there are no plans to change our expectation of foreign earnings reinvestment or the long term nature of our intercompany arrangements 
in may  we amended and extended our revolving credit facility the agreement 
the agreement provides for multi currency borrowings of up to billion which  upon approval of the lenders  may be increased to billion 
the agreement has a sub limit of up to million for standby and trade letters of credit issuances 
amounts may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed through may  borrowings under this agreement will bear interest at either a the base rate  described in the agreement as a fluctuating rate equal to the lead bank s base rate  b the eurodollar rate  described in the agreement as a periodic fixed rate equal to the london interbank offering rate libor plus a percentage spread based on our credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio  or c the rate set through a bid process 
the effective interest rate on yen borrowings was and other borrowings was at the end of at december   we had approximately million of available credit under our revolving credit facility that includes coverage of million from outstanding letters of credit 
we had an additional million of letters of credit outstanding under separate agreements 
at december   we had short term borrowings of approximately million 
of this amount  million was outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
because these borrowings were for short term working capital purposes  they have been classified as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining million of short term borrowings were outstanding under various local currency uncommitted lines of credit for our international subsidiaries and had an effective interest rate at the end of the year of approximately 
our access to uncommitted lines of credit  which provide for working capital related borrowings at various floating interest rates  totaled approximately million at december  
table of contents we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants included in our debt agreements 
based on our fourth quarter results  coupled with our anticipated near term results  we may not be able to comply with these restrictive covenants in the future and are in the process of seeking an amendment to the agreement 
additionally  we may not be in compliance in future periods from factors such as those described under item a risk factors in this form k 
if we do not remain in compliance with these restrictive covenants or if we do not obtain an applicable waiver from such noncompliance  we may not be able to borrow additional funds when and if it becomes necessary  we may incur higher borrowing costs and face more restrictive covenants  and the lenders could accelerate all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations 
we believe an amendment to the agreement will be obtained prior to an event of default  which will likely include additional restrictive covenants 
for further discussion on these restrictive covenants  see item a risk factors financial covenants in existing credit facility 
we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
while our board of directors regularly assesses our dividend policy  there are no current plans to declare a dividend 
cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities the changes in net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflects a decrease in business performance of approximately million as well as an increase in working capital used during the year of approximately million 
working capital is influenced by a number of factors  including the aging of inventory and timing of vendor payments 
the timing of payments is subject to variability during the year depending on a variety of factors  including the flow of goods  credit terms  timing of promotions  vendor production planning  new product introductions and working capital management 
vendor payment deferrals totaled approximately million at year end and million at the end of  but we made no such deferrals at the end of or the effect of such vendor payment deferrals at period end on our financial statements is to report a higher accounts payable balance and lower balance of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility than would otherwise appear if the vendor payments had not been deferred 
for our accounting policy on cash management  see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to a slowdown in sales  some inventories have aged beyond payment terms  and this has resulted in a net increase in working capital 
efforts are underway to mitigate this effect in the future and accordingly  we have reduced inventory purchases and engaged in inventory clearance activities 
the change in cash flows from operating activities during reflects increased contribution from the core business and positive impacts of working capital management 
operating cash flow in reflects increased business performance after considering non cash elements of the charges and non cash equity compensation  offset by the reduction of vendor payment deferrals and payment of taxes 
following our adoption of fas r in the third quarter of  the presentation of tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options in excess of the tax benefit on their estimated fair value has changed from a component of operating activities to a component of financing activities in the statement of cash flows 
investing activities we invested million  million and million in capital expenditures during  and  respectively 
this activity includes the opening  relocating and remodeling of retail stores in north america  as well as distribution network infrastructure costs and investments in an enterprise wide software platform intended to streamline operations

included in the future capital expenditure projections is continued investment in our enterprise wide information technology project that includes capitalized software development costs and related hardware 
proceeds from the disposition of assets in include approximately million from a sale leaseback transaction related to a european warehouse facility and approximately million from the sale of a corporate aircraft 
the realized gain on the sale leaseback transaction is being amortized over the lease term 
during  we also received million as dividends from an equity method investment and placed million of restricted cash on deposit for a transaction that closed in january proceeds from the disposition of assets in include approximately million in cash received from the sale of our corporate campus 
approximately million from the sale was used to satisfy an existing mortgage and is included as a use of cash in financing activities

proceeds from the issuance of long and short term debt totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily driven by the decline in our operating cash flow  as we experienced higher levels of short term borrowings to support our working capital needs 
in connection with the sale of our corporate campus in  a portion of the proceeds was used to liquidate an existing mortgage on one of the facilities

amounts due under this facility have been classified according to the expected timing of their repayment 
short term borrowings consist primarily of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and subsidiary lines of credit 
as stated above  amounts due under our revolving credit facility have been classified according to the expected timing of their repayment 
the present value of these obligations are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
the operating lease obligations presented reflect future minimum lease payments due under the non cancelable portions of our leases as of december  our operating lease obligations are described in note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the table above  sublease income is distributed by period 

table of contents purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that are enforceable and legally binding on us that meet any of the following criteria they are non cancelable  we would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled  or we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services 
if the obligation is non cancelable  the entire value of the contract is included in the table 
if the obligation is cancelable  but we would incur a penalty if cancelled  the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation 
if we can unilaterally terminate the agreement simply by providing a certain number of days notice or by paying a termination fee  we have included the amount of the termination fee or the amount that would be paid over the notice period 
as of december   purchase obligations include television  radio and newspaper advertising  sports sponsorship commitments  telephone services  and software licenses and service and maintenance contracts for information technology 
contracts that can be unilaterally terminated without a penalty have not been included 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million classified as deferred income taxes and other long term liabilities 
this caption primarily consists of our net long term deferred income taxes  the unfunded portion of our pension plans  deferred lease credits  and liabilities under our deferred compensation plans 
these liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain 
see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and note g for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the pension plans and the deferred compensation plan 
the table above includes scheduled  acquisition related payments 
in addition to the above  we have letters of credit totaling million outstanding at the end of the year  and we have recourse for private label credit card receivables transferred to a third party 
we record an estimate for losses on these receivables in our financial statements 
the total outstanding amount transferred to a third party at the end of the year was approximately million 
we have entered into a long term lease on a new corporate campus facility that is expected to be available for occupancy at or about the end of this lease will be accounted for as a capital lease and therefore  the present value of the lease obligation will be reflected as a component of long term debt on our balance sheet as of the date of initial possession 
this lease has a base term of years with certain renewal options that at lease inception are not reasonably assured of being exercised  and the present value of the obligation is approximately million 
during  we executed a lease agreement on certain corporate aircraft and the scheduled lease payments are included in the operating lease payments disclosed in the table above 
additionally  the lease includes a guaranteed residual value provision that could require us to make up the shortfall  if any  between the selling price of the aircraft and the then outstanding financing amount 
the maximum amount of the residual value guarantee is approximately million  however  based on current and anticipated market conditions for the related aircraft  sale proceeds are projected to be sufficient to repay the related borrowings 
no residual value guarantees are included in the contractual obligations table above 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements other than those related to our operating lease agreements as described above 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements each year we enter into purchase arrangements with our vendors 
many of those arrangements require those vendors to make payments to us or provide credits to be used against future purchases if and when certain conditions are met 
we generally refer to these arrangements as vendor programs  and they typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the largest category is volume based rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
many of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined tier  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for our estimates 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief at any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
during  we experienced a slowdown in business and began reducing our purchases 
in the fourth quarter  it became apparent that we were not going to reach the anticipated full year purchase levels and reduced our vendor program recognition accordingly 
the impact of this change in estimate primarily attributable to modifications of previously anticipated purchase volume tiers was to reduce fourth quarter pretax results by approximately million 

table of contents the second category of arrangements we have with our vendors is event based programs 
these arrangements can take many forms  including advertising support  special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  and various other special programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for certain of our activities that lower the vendor s cost to ship their product to our facilities 
while finalizing the results for the third quarter of  it became known to our management that complete and accurate information about future purchase or performance conditions was not communicated to those responsible for recording certain transactions  and that under these arrangements  some vendor program funds should have been deferred into future periods in accordance with our established practices 
accordingly  we restated certain prior period financial statements as discussed above 
we also took disciplinary action that included terminations of certain persons in our merchandising department and have implemented policies and safeguards to protect against this activity from recurring 
while vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates  the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are collected within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we monitor active inventory for excessive quantities and slow moving items and record adjustments as necessary to lower the value if the anticipated realizable amount is below cost 
we also identify merchandise that we plan to discontinue or have begun to phase out and assess the estimated recoverability of the carrying value 
this includes consideration of the quantity of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of current and projected market conditions 
if necessary  we record a charge to reduce the carrying value of this merchandise to our estimate of the lower of cost or realizable amount 
additional promotional activities may be initiated and markdowns may be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
our accrual for obsolescence is reviewed each period and dynamically adjusted to acknowledge the composition of inventory  selling experience and our future outlook 
during  we evaluated and refined our techniques for estimating obsolescence related to certain product categories to better align with proceeds being realized on ultimate disposition 
the resulting obsolescence accruals in the first and second quarters were lowered by approximately million and million  respectively  reflecting updated estimates and product dispositions 
during the fourth quarter  we increased our obsolescence accrual by approximately million to adjust the value of certain active inventory categories for quantities on hand that exceeded our current selling rate and for certain low margin inventory items with declining realizable values 
intangible asset testing absent any circumstances that warrant testing at another time  we test for goodwill and non amortizing intangible asset impairment as part of our year end closing process 
our goodwill testing consists of comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying amounts  including recorded goodwill 
we estimate the fair values of each of our reporting units by discounting their projected future cash flows and compare the results to other indicators of value 
developing these future cash flow projections requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates regarding the sales  gross margin and operating expenses of our reporting units  as well as future economic conditions and the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  or should our operating plans or business model change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
any such write down would be included in operating expenses 
we recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairments in while we make reasoned estimates of future performance  actual results below these expectations  or changes in business direction can result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
closed store accruals and asset impairments we regularly assess the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales growth  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain operating performance targets  we may decide to close the store 
when a store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation 
table of contents of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
we adjusted the carrying value of some of these obligations as part of the charges 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating expenses 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
new stores may require years to develop a customer base necessary to achieve expected cash flows and we typically do not test for impairment during this early stage 
however  if in subsequent periods  it is determined that the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
as discussed above  the charges recorded in and include significant impairment charges 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in our tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the realization of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
generally  changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
decreases in valuation allowances associated with nols acquired in a business combination reduce goodwill  though accounting rules on this matter are scheduled to change in in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
during  we recognized significant tax benefits from changes in valuation allowances  accruals for uncertain tax positions and a shift during the course of the year in the proportion of foreign pre tax income 
our effective tax rate in future periods may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in related judgments or pre tax operations 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties competitive factors over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
warehouse clubs have added to their in store assortment by adding catalogs and websites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered 
we also face competition from other office supply superstores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them also have begun to feature technology products 
many of them may price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry 

table of contents we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
economic factors our customers in the north american retail division and many of our customers in the north american business solutions division are predominantly small and home office businesses 
accordingly  these customers may curtail their spending in reaction to macroeconomic conditions  such as changes in the housing market and higher fuel costs  higher credit costs  credit availability  possible recession and other factors 
the us economy has experienced softness throughout  negatively impacting our sales and profits 
market sensitive risks and positions we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
we manage the exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates or foreign currency rates is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of less than million 
market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below fair risk fair risk dollars in thousands carrying value value sensitivity carrying value value sensitivity million senior notes revolving credit facility the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
our expansion in europe in recent years increased our operations in countries with euro and british pound functional currencies 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we also are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from a limited amount of inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
the notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures were million at their highest point during also  from time to time we enter into foreign exchange forward transaction to protect against possible changes in exchange rates related to scheduled or anticipated cash movements among our operating entities 
generally  we evaluate the performance of our international businesses by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is impacted by external events 

table of contents inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales lower during the second quarter 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles  but we do not consider our operations to be highly seasonal 
additionally  business cycles can impact our operations and financial position when compared to other periods
