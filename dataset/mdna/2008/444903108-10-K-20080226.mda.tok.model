item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview human genome sciences hgs is a commercially focused biopharmaceutical company poised for the market with three products in late stage clinical development albuferon for chronic hepatitis c  lymphostat b for systemic lupus erythematosus  and abthrax tm for inhalation anthrax 
all three of these products are progressing toward commercialization 
we expect to have the first phase data for albuferon available by the end of we expect to complete enrollment in both of the phase trials of lymphostat b by fall also  we expect to begin delivery of abthrax to the us strategic national stockpile by fall of this year  which will result in our first product sales 
hgs also has a portfolio of novel drugs in earlier stages of development  led by our trail receptor antibodies in mid stage development for cancer  and including substantial financial rights to three novel drugs in the glaxosmithkline gsk clinical pipeline 
our strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies allow us to leverage our strengths and gain access to sales and marketing infrastructure  as well as complementary technologies 
some of these partnerships provide us with licensing fees  clinical development cost sharing  milestone payments and rights to royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
in some cases  we are entitled to certain commercialization  co promotion  revenue sharing and other product rights 
with a strong cash position  a management team experienced in bringing products to market  an experienced drug development organization and significant capabilities in biologicals manufacturing  hgs has the resources and capabilities necessary to achieve near term commercial success while sustaining a viable pipeline that supports our long term growth 
we have not received any significant product sales revenue or royalties from product sales and  other than potentially with respect to abthrax  any significant revenue from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years is uncertain 
to date  all of our revenue relates to payments made under our collaboration agreements 
during  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical  ltd 
novartis 
under this agreement  novartis will co develop and co commercialize albuferon and share equally in development costs  sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized in the us novartis will be responsible for commercialization outside the us and will pay hgs a royalty on these sales 
we received a million up front fee from novartis upon the execution of the agreement and are recognizing this payment as revenue ratably over the estimated development period ending in including this up front fee  we are entitled to payments aggregating million upon the successful attainment of certain milestones 
for the year ended december   we received milestone payments from novartis of million 
we are recognizing these milestones as revenue ratably over the estimated remaining development period 
we may not receive any future payments and may not be able to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
in  gsk exercised its option to co develop and co commercialize two of our products  lymphostat b and hgs etr in accordance with a co development and co commercialization agreement signed during related to lymphostat b  we and gsk will share equally in phase and development costs  and will share equally in sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized 
we received a million payment during as partial consideration for entering into this agreement with respect to lymphostat b and are recognizing this payment as revenue ratably over the estimated development period ending in we did not receive any payments related to this agreement during the terms of our agreement with respect to hgs etr are to be negotiated by the parties 
in  we entered into a two phase contract to supply abthrax  a human monoclonal antibody developed for use in the treatment of anthrax disease  with the us government 
under the first phase of the contract  we supplied ten grams of abthrax to the us department of health and human services hhs for comparative in vitro and in vivo testing 
during  under the second phase of the contract  the us government exercised its option to overview continued purchase  treatment courses of abthrax for the strategic national stockpile 
we have started manufacturing and continue to work towards fda approval of abthrax 
we do not know whether we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval for this product and deliver the order to the us government 
we expect to recognize approximately million from this contract  with approximately of the total value in  as we begin to deliver abthrax 
during  we completed a purchase and sale agreement with biomed realty trust  inc biomed relating to our traville headquarters traville and large scale manufacturing lsm facility 
we also completed the sale of assets of our cogenesys division to trigenesys inc now named cogenesys  inc 
cogenesys and entered into a license agreement for certain related intellectual property 
in exchange for the assets  assumption of certain liabilities  intellectual property  and reimbursement of expenditures  we received approximately a equity interest on a fully diluted basis in cogenesys 
we expect that any significant revenue or income for at least the next several years may be limited to investment income  payments under collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  cost reimbursements from gsk and novartis  payments from the sale of product rights  abthrax revenue and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on clinical trials required for the development of antibody and protein product candidates 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and significant losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
see note b  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical investments 
we account for investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values  except for our investments in cogenesys and aegera pharmaceuticals  inc aegera  which are carried at historical cost because they are privately held companies for which no quoted market price is available 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including but not limited to the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market values recover  which may be maturity 
if management determines that such an impairment exists we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we classify critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as non current marketable securities 
we monitor the equity activity of the cogenesys investment and we will monitor the activity of the aegera investment on a regular basis to determine whether any impairment in its value has occurred 
leases 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
during  we terminated one lease agreement the traville lease with wachovia development corporation wdc  which had been structured as a synthetic lease and had been accounted for as an operating lease 
in place of the traville synthetic lease  we entered into a year lease agreement with biomed  which acquired the traville facility from wdc 
we account for the traville lease with biomed as an operating lease 
during and as described further in note i  long term debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our lsm facility and headquarters land to biomed  and simultaneously agreed to lease such assets back over a period of years 
we accounted for this transaction in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases sale leaseback transactions involving real estate 
because we have continuing involvement with the properties and an option to repurchase such assets  we recorded the sale and leaseback of these assets as a financing transaction and accordingly recorded the allocated sale proceeds as outstanding debt on our balance sheet 
we account for lease payments under the related lease agreements as principal and interest payments on this debt 
we retained ownership of approximately million in equipment located at the lsm  which is required to be kept in place during the lease term or upon any expiration  termination or default 
impairments of long lived assets 
long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be sold are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
during  we recorded exit and impairment charges of approximately million and million relating to certain space in our traville headquarters and certain laboratory space  respectively 
during  we sold the laboratory space and reversed the remaining exit and impairment charges related to that space 
revenue 
our revenue recognition policies for all non refundable up front license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

in addition  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  eitf provides guidance on when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting  non refundable up front license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
if not deemed substantive  we would recognize such critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued milestone as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and  the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone and any ongoing research and development or other services are priced at fair value 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
our up front license fee with novartis in connection with our albuferon product is being recognized ratably over an estimated four year clinical development period 
to the extent we achieve the clinical development milestones set forth in the novartis agreement  these will be recognized ratably over the remaining estimated clinical development period from the date of attainment 
our initial payment from gsk in connection with lymphostat b is being recognized ratably over the estimated four year clinical development period 
our up front license fee with gsk in connection with syncria formerly albugon is being recognized ratably over the estimated seven year clinical development period 
our revenues with transgene  sa transgene are being recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the ten year term of the agreement or prorated upon the selection of genes by transgene 
our revenues with cogenesys  as they relate to the intellectual property license  are being recognized on a straight line basis over the three year period covered by the manufacturing services agreement 
our other revenues in  and have been recognized in full upon receipt  as we have no continuing obligation 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily include related salaries  outside services  materials and supplies and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
our drug development expenses include accruals for clinical site and clinical research organization cro costs 
estimates of the incurred to date but not yet received invoices must be made for clinical site and cro costs in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
reimbursement of research and development expenses received in connection with collaborative cost sharing agreements is recorded as a reduction of such expenses 
stock compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan the incentive plan under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the quoted market value on the date of grant 
the incentive plan also provides for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights  restricted non vested or unrestricted stock awards  stock equivalent units or performance based stock awards 
prior to january   we accounted for the incentive plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock option awards was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as all options granted under the incentive plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the estimated term of the option and the estimated future volatility of the option 
the estimated term and estimated future volatility of the options require our judgment 
we have provided pro forma disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued net loss and net loss per share for the year ended december  as if we used the fair value method under fas we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods  or services 
exit accruals 
in  we exited certain facilities  which required us to make significant estimates in several areas including the realizable values of assets deemed redundant or excess and the ability to generate sublease income 
we recorded an initial liability of approximately million in lease related costs  excluding million in asset impairments with respect to our exit activities 
during  we sold one of the facilities we exited in and reversed the remaining exit and impairment charges related to that space 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted primarily of revenue recognized from novartis of million for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for albuferon  million from gsk related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for lymphostat b  revenue recognized from transgene of million and million in revenue recognized from cogenesys  a related party 
the revenues consisted primarily of million in revenue recognized from gsk  consisting of million related to syncria  including a million milestone received and recognized  million related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for lymphostat b  and million related to milestones met for two other products under gsk development  revenue recognized from novartis of million for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and a milestone reached in for albuferon  revenue recognized from transgene of million and revenue recognized from cogenesys of million 
expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses for include million paid to aegera in connection with a collaboration and license agreement 
research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed or to be reimbursed by novartis and gsk  respectively 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk respectively  and million of cost reimbursement from cogenesys 
we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the million paid to aegera in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement and purchase price premium 
our research costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to cost reimbursement under our collaboration agreements and reduced activity in this area for our abthrax program 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued our manufacturing costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to cost reimbursement under our collaboration agreements and reduced non project activities  partially offset by increased production activities for hgs etr and hgs etr our manufacturing costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to costs associated with the complete enrollment of phase trials for albuferon and ongoing enrollment of phase trials for lymphostat b 
these phase trials were just starting at the end of  therefore minimal expenses were incurred in compared to our clinical development costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements  which began in mid the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses associated with patent proceedings for certain of our products  partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense 
lease termination and restructuring credits in related to the reversal of a liability and the recording of a gain aggregating million in connection with the purchase and sale of a small laboratory and office building 
the lease termination and restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  consist of a lease termination charge of million related primarily to the biomed financing and exit and impairment charges of approximately million related to space no longer in use at our headquarters location and a small laboratory building 
see note n  facility related exit costs and other restructuring charges  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to higher interest rates in our portfolio  partially offset by lower average balances of cash  short term investments and marketable securities 
investment income also includes realized net gains on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for the year ended december  as compared to net losses of million for the year ended december  the yield on our investments was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  we believe investment income will be lower in as a result of lower average balances than and potentially lower interest rates 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to interest expense on the debt associated with the sale and leaseback of the lsm facility to biomed 
interest expense for the year ended december  is net of interest capitalized of million  in connection with the construction of our lsm facility 
no interest expense was capitalized in the third and fourth quarters of as we placed the lsm facility in service and ceased capitalization of interest at the end of the second quarter 
interest expense  before capitalized interest  was million for the year ended december  results of operations continued years ended december  and continued during  we had no gains on sale of equity investments 
during we recognized a gain on sale of investment of million related to the sale of our remaining equity interest in cambridge antibody technology ltd 
cat  a long term investment  for net proceeds of million compared to a cost basis of million 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the increased loss for compared to is primarily due to increased clinical development costs related to our phase programs  increased research costs related to our license agreement with aegera and increased interest expense  partially offset by increased revenue and a decrease in lease termination and restructuring charges 
years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in revenue recognized from gsk  consisting of million related to syncria  including a million milestone received and recognized  million related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for lymphostat b  and million related to milestones met for two other products under gsk development  revenue recognized from novartis of million for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and a milestone reached in for albuferon  revenue recognized from transgene of million and revenue recognized from cogenesys  a related party  of million 
the revenues of million consisted primarily of the recognition of million of milestone payments from gsk related to syncria and the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene 
effective with the sale of our investment in transgene in  transgene is no longer a related party 
for the year ended december   revenue from transgene of million is considered to be related party revenue 
expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk respectively  and million of cost reimbursement from cogenesys 
we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to reduced research activities arising from the sale of the cogenesys division in the second quarter of and the reimbursement of million for cogenesys research expenses incurred from january through may the reduction in research expenses was partially offset by million of stock based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december  our research costs for the year ended december   are net of million of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  reduced process development activities for hgs etr  lymphostat b and hgs etr were partially offset by increased activity for abthrax and albuferon and million of stock based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december  pharmaceutical sciences costs for the year ended december  are net of million of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of increased production activities for lymphostat b  albuferon and abthrax  along with costs of putting the lsm facility into service during and results of operations continued years ended december  and continued million in stock based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december   partially offset by collaborative cost reimbursements and decreased costs related to hgs etr  albugon and hgs etr our manufacturing costs for the year ended december  are net of million of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our clinical development costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a decline in phase trial activity for the lymphostat b and albuferon studies  hgs etr and collaborative cost reimbursements  partially offset by stock based compensation expense of million recognized for the year ended december  our clinical development costs for the year ended december  are net of million of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options of million and increased facility and other costs  partially offset by the absence of a stock modification charge in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include a million charge arising from the modification of a stock option agreement for a key officer as described more fully in note k  stockholders equity  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the lease termination and restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  consist of a lease termination charge of million related to the biomed financing as described further below  and exit and impairment charges of approximately million related to space no longer in use at our headquarters location and a small laboratory building 
with respect to the lease termination charge  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with biomed and sold or caused to be sold our headquarters and lsm facility and concurrently entered into long term lease agreements with biomed for the two facilities 
we recorded a facility financing charge of approximately million related this agreement  which included a non cash million lease termination charge related to the prior headquarters lease 
the headquarters related exit and impairment charges are based upon our determination that we could meet our clinical drug manufacturing requirements for the foreseeable future within our lsm and small scale manufacturing facilities 
as a result  we exited certain clinical manufacturing space at our headquarters facility during and recorded exit and impairment charges of approximately million 
we recorded additional exit and impairment charges of approximately million related to the consolidation during of a small laboratory building into our headquarters and lsm 
no facility related charges were incurred in see note n  facility related exit costs and other restructuring charges  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to rising interest rates in our portfolio  partially offset by average lower balances of cash  short term investments and marketable securities 
investment income also includes realized net losses on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for the year ended december  as compared to net losses of million for the year ended december  the yield on our investments was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  results of operations continued years ended december  and continued interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to interest expense on the debt associated with the sale and leaseback of the lsm facility to biomed 
we sold the lsm facility to biomed during the second quarter of in a sale leaseback transaction that was recorded as a financing transaction for accounting purposes  resulting in additional debt being recorded at the time of sale 
interest expense for the years ended december  and is net of interest capitalized of million and million respectively  in connection with the construction of our lsm facility 
no interest expense was capitalized in the third and fourth quarters of as we placed the lsm facility in service and ceased capitalization of interest at the end of the second quarter 
interest expense  before capitalized interest  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the gain on sale of investment of million during relates to the sale of our remaining equity interest in cat  a long term investment  for net proceeds of million compared to a cost basis of million 
in we completed the private placement of million of subordinated convertible notes 
we used the net proceeds to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of million of and notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million as of december  in  we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of this debt of million  including unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the repurchased debt 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the increased loss for compared to is primarily due to lease termination and impairment charges of million  or per share  increased interest expense of million  or per share  arising primarily from the debt associated with the biomed transaction  the recognition of million  or per share  of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options  which arose in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   partially offset by the million  or per share  gain from the sale of our investment in cat and decreased research and development activities arising from the sale of our cogenesys division 
the net loss for the year ended december  included a non cash stock option modification charge of million or per share  related to the departure of two senior executives 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   our net income for the year ended december   is approximately million  or per share  lower than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
for the year ended december   if we had accounted for employee stock options under the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 we would have recognized approximately million  or per share  of additional expense 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the use of working capital to fund our operations  payment to aegera for the up front fee under a license agreement and equity purchase totaling million and an increase in our accrued expenses related to clinical trials 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which may increase relative to historical levels as we focus on clinical trials and manufacturing required for the development of our active product candidates 
in the event our working capital needs for exceed our available working capital  we can utilize our non current marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
we may continue to improve our working capital position during through the receipt of collaboration fees or financing activities 
in february  teva pharmaceuticals industries  ltd 
teva acquired all the outstanding shares of cogenesys 
we will receive a total of approximately million  of which approximately million was received in february  from our investment in cogenesys 
we will be evaluating our working capital position on a continual basis 
liquidity and capital resources continued the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we have initiated two phase trials  and have several ongoing phase and phase trials and expect to initiate additional trials in the future 
completion of these trials may extend several years or more  but the length of time generally varies considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
we estimate that the completion periods for our phase  phase and phase trials could span one year  one to two years and two to four years  respectively 
some trials may take considerably longer to complete 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
our clinical development expenses are impacted by the clinical phase of our drug candidates 
our expenses increase as our drug candidates move to later phases of clinical development 
the status of our clinical projects is as follows clinical trial status as of december  product candidate indication active candidates albuferon hepatitis c phase phase phase lymphostat b systemic lupus erythematosus phase phase phase lymphostat b rheumatoid arthritis phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase ccr mab hiv phase abthrax anthrax hgs cancer inactive candidates hgs trj cancer phase phase lymphorad cancer includes only those candidates for which an investigational new drug ind application has been filed with the fda 
clinical trial status defined as when patients are being dosed 
initial phase trial completed and phase enrollment initiated in  patient dosing began in initial phase trial completed  extension safety study ongoing 
initial phase trial completed  further development under review 
us government executed the second phase of the contract in  placing an order for  doses of abthrax 
in addition  clinical development and manufacturing activities are in progress 
as of december   only the first phase of the contract comparative testing had been executed 
ind filed in december with respect to hgs formerly aeg 
clinical development suspended in clinical development discontinued in we identify our potential drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
liquidity and capital resources continued we are advancing a number of drug candidates  antibodies and albumin fusion proteins  in part to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
accordingly  we believe our future financial commitments  including those for preclinical  clinical or manufacturing activities  are not substantially dependent on any single drug candidate 
should we be unable to sustain a multi product drug pipeline  our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates would increase 
we must receive regulatory clearance to advance each of our products into and through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the appropriate regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all fda requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our drugs and the manufacturing facilities will meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  we entered into a collaboration agreement in with novartis to co develop and co commercialize albuferon 
under this agreement  we will co commercialize albuferon in the united states  and will share us commercialization costs and us profits equally 
novartis will be responsible for commercialization outside the us and will pay us a royalty on those sales 
we and novartis share equally in development costs 
we are entitled to receive milestones aggregating approximately million  including a non refundable up front license fee of million  which we received in as of december   we have earned and received milestones aggregating million including the up front fee 
we are recognizing these milestones as revenue ratably over the estimated remaining development period 
in  we entered into a collaboration agreement with gsk with respect to lymphostat b and received a payment of million 
we and gsk share equally in phase and development costs  and will share equally in sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized 
during  we recorded approximately million of reimbursable expenses from novartis and gsk with respect to our cost sharing agreements 
we have incurred certain expenses that may not be reimbursable under the cost sharing agreements  and accordingly  have recorded the cost sharing benefit in our financial statements as of december  net of a reserve of million for those costs that may not be reimbursed 
we have other collaborators who have sole responsibility for product development 
for example  gsk is developing other products under separate agreements as part of our overall relationship with them 
we have no control over the progress of gsk s development plans 
while we have recorded million in revenue from gsk in connection with a development milestone met by gsk during relating to our agreement with gsk for syncria  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the likelihood of receiving future milestone or royalty payments under these agreements 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty what impact gsk s decision to jointly develop and commercialize hgs etr will have on our development costs  in part because a joint development agreement must first be concluded 
we also cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development efforts and therefore  our capital and liquidity requirements 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds and investment income will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  primarily including the scope and costs of our clinical development programs  the scope and costs of our manufacturing and process development activities and the magnitude of our discovery program 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
depending upon market and interest rate conditions  we are exploring  and  from time to time  may take actions to strengthen further our financial position 
in this regard  during we entered into a real estate financing transaction that raised net proceeds of approximately million and released restricted investments of approximately million 
in addition  we refinanced approximately million of our convertible liquidity and capital resources continued subordinated debt during we may undertake other financings and may further repurchase or restructure some or all of our outstanding convertible debt instruments in the future depending upon market and other conditions 
we have certain contractual obligations which may have a future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
our operating leases  along with our unconditional purchase obligations  are not recorded on our balance sheets 
debt associated with the sale and accompanying leaseback of our lsm facility to biomed in is recorded on our balance sheet as of december  and under the lsm lease  we have an option to purchase the property between and at prices ranging between approximately million and million  depending upon when we exercise this option 
we have an option to purchase the traville facility in for million 
our contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows payments due by period one year two to four to after total or less three years five years five years dollars in millions contractual obligations long term debt convertible notes long term lease commitment biomed operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheets total contractual cash obligations contractual interest obligations related to our convertible subordinated notes included above total million as of december  contractual interest obligations of million  million and million are due in one year or less  two to three years and four to five years  respectively 
contractual interest obligations related to biomed are included above and aggregate million as of december  contractual interest obligations of million  million  million and million are due in one year or less  two to three years  four to five years and after five years  respectively 
includes traville headquarters operating lease with biomed with aggregate payments of million 
lease payments of million  million  million  and million are due in one year or less  two to three years  four to five years and after five years  respectively 
the operating lease obligations shown above are the gross amounts  not considering sublease income 
contractual sublease income of million  million and million is due in one year or less  two to three years and four to five years  respectively 
certain of our operating leases contain financial covenants with respect to minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and minimum levels of net worth 
during  we amended certain of these leases to eliminate the minimum net worth covenant and adjust the minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities required under the leases 
we also pledged additional collateral of approximately million to certain lessors to satisfy the minimum net worth covenant associated with certain other leases 
our unconditional purchase obligations relate to commitments for capital expenditures 
in the event we reach certain development milestones for albuferon  lymphostat b and abthrax  such as successful completion of phase trials or regulatory approval  we would be obligated to make payments of up to million over the next five years  including million in in the event we reach certain development milestones related to hgs  we would be obligated to pay up to million  including liquidity and capital resources continued million in our other products are in either phase or phase and would also obligate us to make certain milestone payments should they reach phase or regulatory approval 
these other payments could result in aggregate milestone payments of million 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our products will reach these milestones  we have excluded these amounts and any royalty payments from the above table 
for additional discussion of our debt obligations and lease commitments  see note i  long term debt and note j  commitments and other matters  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately billion  which expire  if unused  on december  we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carry forwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  on december  our unrestricted and restricted funds may be invested in us treasury securities  government agency obligations  high grade debt securities and various money market instruments rated a or better 
such investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with an emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital 
off balance sheet arrangements during and  we entered into two long term leases with the maryland economic development corporation medco expiring january  for a process development and small scale manufacturing facility aggregating  square feet and built to our specifications 
we have accounted for these leases as operating leases 
the facility was financed primarily through a combination of bonds issued by medco medco bonds and loans issued to medco by certain state of maryland agencies 
we have no equity interest in medco 
rent is based upon medco s debt service obligations and annual base rent under the leases currently is approximately million 
the medco bonds are secured by letters of credit issued for the account of medco which expire in december medco s debt service obligations may be affected by prevailing interest rate conditions in  which could in turn affect our rent and the level of our restricted investments 
we have restricted investments of approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  and are now required to maintain restricted investments of million which serve as additional security for the medco letters of credit reimbursement obligation 
upon default or early lease termination or in the event the letters of credit will not be renewed  the medco bond indenture trustee can draw upon the letters of credit to pay the medco bonds as they are tendered 
in such an event  we could lose part or all of our restricted investments and could record a charge to earnings for a corresponding amount 
alternatively  we have an option during or at the end of the lease term to purchase this facility for an aggregate amount that declines from approximately million in to approximately million in the lease agreements contain covenants with respect to tangible net worth  cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  restrictions on dividends  as well as other covenants

the forward looking statements are based on our current intent  belief and expectations 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations of a material nature that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do  however  have certain aspects of our global clinical studies that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio may be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government agency obligations  high grade debt having at least an a rating and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately months  significantly decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of million  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are generally held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates or general market conditions related to our investment securities held as of december  we believe that any market change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the yield on comparable two year investments was approximately  as compared to our current portfolio yield of approximately 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates will adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and are replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
we have equity investments in cogenesys  aegera and via pharmaceuticals  inc via formerly corautus genetics inc as of december   the estimated fair value of our equity investment in via was approximately million 
we account for the via investment as available for sale and have a corresponding unrealized gain on our balance sheet of an amount equal to the via market value 
accordingly  any write down of our investment balance for via will be fully offset by the unrealized gain 
our investment in via is subject to equity market risk 
because cogenesys and aegera are privately held entities  we are unable to obtain a quoted market price with respect to the fair value of these investments 
we carry the cogenesys investment at its cost of million 
we paid million for the aegera investment  but recorded and carry the investment at million based on the value per share obtained by aegera through external financing during we review the carrying value of the cogenesys and aegera investments on a periodic basis for indicators of impairment  and adjust the values accordingly 
as a result of terminating the traville lease  the amount of investments that we are required to restrict has declined significantly 
the facility leases we entered into with biomed during require us to maintain minimum levels of restricted investments of approximately million  or million if in the form of cash  as collateral for these facilities 
together with the requirement to maintain up to approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our process development and manufacturing facility leases  and our additional collateral for one of our operating leases  our overall level of restricted investments will be approximately million 
although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain this level of restricted investments in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
our convertible subordinated notes bear interest at fixed rates 
as a result  our interest expense on these notes is not affected by changes in interest rates 
during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences europe gmbh hgs europe that is managing our clinical trials and clinical research collaborations in european countries 
although hgs europe s activities are denominated primarily in euros  we believe the foreign currency fluctuation risks to be immaterial to our operations as a whole 
during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences pacific pty ltd 
hgs pacific that is sponsoring our clinical trials in the asia pacific region 
we currently do not anticipate hgs pacific to have any operational activity and therefore we do not believe we will have any foreign currency fluctuation risks with respect to hgs pacific
