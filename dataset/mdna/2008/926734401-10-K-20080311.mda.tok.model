operating results the company reported a increase in net income for fiscal year versus fiscal year  reporting million compared to million in the prior year 
the company also posted operating income for fiscal year of million compared to operating income of million for fiscal year  an increase of which led to an increase in the operating margin percentage for fiscal of versus for fiscal 
table of contents the improved results were driven by our continuing focus on cost control and efficiency in our business  a solid performance by our services organization and a one time deferred tax valuation allowance adjustment to the income tax provision 
in the fourth quarter of  the company had operating income of million as compared to operating income of million for the fourth quarter of the decrease was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses of million as we increased spending on headcount related items 
total revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of over the fiscal year revenue of million 
services revenue increased million or and license revenue of million declined million or as compared to license revenues of million in the fourth quarter of were down as compared to the fourth quarter of maintenance and support revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and  respectively  as compared to professional services revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and as compared to the same period in international revenue comprised and of total revenue for the year and quarter ended december   respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of our annual or quarterly revenues 
the gross profit margin in fiscal of decreased million or from fiscal as a result of the lower license revenue 
the total costs of revenue increased million to million from million 
the increase was driven by higher costs in our professional services organization of million associated with the million increase in professional services revenue 
this increase was offset by a decrease in cost of revenue for product license of million to million from million in fiscal  associated with the lower license revenue 
total expenses  including both cost of revenue and operating expenses  for fiscal and for the fourth quarter of were million and million respectively  as compared to fiscal and fourth quarter expenses of million and million 
the primary driver for the decrease in the expenses for fiscal was a decrease in operating expenses of million or 
the million is made up primarily of a decrease in research and development expenses of million driven by both headcount and facility related costs  a decrease in sales and marketing expenses of million driven by a reduction in headcount related expenses and discretionary spending and an increase in general and administrative expenses of million driven by higher professional services fees 
liquidity decreased during the year with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments reducing by million to a total of million at december  versus million at december  the decrease is as a result of the share repurchase program the company initiated in november and increased investments in long term marketable securities 
during the year the company paid million to repurchase its common stock and continues to carry no debt

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed with and agreed upon the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  estimating business restructuring accruals  and valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
revenue consists of product and service fees 
product fee income is earned through the licensing or right to use our software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and support services subscription services  consulting services and training services 

table of contents we do not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights to return  refund or cancel have expired or acceptance has occurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements as revised by sab and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where software licenses are sold with maintenance and support or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements specific to us 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value and the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is then allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
revenue allocated to product license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant remaining obligations with regard to implementation are outstanding and collection of a fixed or determinable fee is probable 
we consider all payments outside our normal payment terms  including all amounts due in excess of one year  to not be fixed and determinable and such amounts are recognized as revenue as they become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
for software arrangements where we are obligated to perform professional services for implementation of the product  we evaluate whether delivery has occurred upon shipment of software or upon completion of services and if the customer payment is probable 
this evaluation is made based on various factors such as the nature of the services work  order type eg initial vs 
follow on  customer s payment history  etc 
in the instances where delivery is deemed not to have occurred upon shipment based on the aforementioned factors  license revenue is recognized when we have no significant remaining obligations with regard to the implementation 
revenue from perpetual licenses that include unspecified  additional software products is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the delivery of the first product 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to subscription services  including implementation and set up fees  is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
we recognize professional services sold with subscription offerings over the term of the related subscription contract as these services are considered to be inseparable from the subscription service 
revenue allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our products as i such services are available from other vendors and ii we have sufficient experience in providing such services 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized 
accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 

table of contents we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and in doing so  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
for example  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
stock based compensation 
the company measures all share based payment awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expenses for all share based payments on a straight line basis over the service period that the awards are expected to vest pursuant to the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment statement r and staff accounting bulletin sab of the securities and exchange commission 
restricted stock and stock options issued under equity plans as well as well as stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans are subject to the provisions of statement r and the interpretive guidance of sab the company adopted statement r using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method compensation expense was recognized effective january  for a all share based payments granted or modified after that date and b based on the previous requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to that date that remain unvested as of january  we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for the effect of income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes sfas no 
and the various interpretations thereof 
at the end of each interim period we make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
this estimated effective tax rate is used to determine income taxes on a current year to date basis from ordinary operations 
estimating an effective tax rate involves estimates and forecasts by management in arriving at an estimated full year tax liability on a legal entity basis 
in each successive interim period  to the extent our estimates need to be revised  we expect that our effective tax rate will change accordingly  affecting tax expense or benefit for both that successive interim period as well as year to date interim results 
in addition to the tax provision attributable to ordinary operations  the income tax expense recorded will also reflect the impact of discrete adjustments for each interim period 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the gaap and tax treatment of certain income and expense 
we must assess and make estimates regarding  the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered 
to the extent that we determine that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance against such assets 
in making such a determination  we must take into account positive and negative evidence including projections of future taxable income and assessments of potential tax planning strategies 

table of contents in we released a portion of the valuation allowance we had recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the determination that it is now more likely than not that part of the net operating loss carryforward will be realized 
recognition of the deferred tax asset was primarily based on management s conclusions regarding our ability to utilize net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to offset income in future periods 
although we anticipate the company will continue its trend of recent profitability and that some portion of the valuation allowance will be reduced in future periods  a subsequent decrease in the forecast in the future periods or future losses might require an increase to the valuation allowance resulting in a potentially material charge to income tax expense in future periods 
tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes fin 
although we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax filings across all of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we must evaluate potential uncertainties and record a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on these positions 
we believe that our accruals related to such uncertainties are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
however  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities  necessitating a material adjustment to our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods in which such determination is made 
the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was million and million at december  and  respectively 
estimating business restructuring accruals 
we vacated excess leased facilities as a result of the restructuring plan we initiated in and subsequently expanded in  and we recorded an accrual for the remaining lease liabilities of such vacated properties as well as brokerage commissions  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
we estimated the costs of these excess leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and sublease income  based on market information and trend analysis 
we continually assess our real estate portfolio and may vacate or occupy other leased space as dictated by our analysis 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate our accrual for facility lease commitments if one  or more  of the company s subtenants default on their executed lease agreement s with the company 
in addition  actual operating expenses could differ from current estimates 
valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  in accounting for the valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement  we replaced the ratable amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets with a periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
we assess our goodwill on october of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the events and circumstances the company considers include significant changes in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators and competition 
in addition  the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value or revised useful life 
as required by statement  the impairment test is accomplished using a two stepped approach 
the first step screens for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
to determine the company s fair value  the company employs the market capitalization approach  comparing the net book value of the company to its market capitalization 
if  under the first step  an  impairment is indicated  a second step is employed to measure the impairment

the total number of sales and support personnel was as of december  versus as of december  services 
services revenue increased in and in the increase in is attributable to both maintenance and support and professional services 
the increase in maintenance and support is attributable to continued strong renewal rates and price increases across our customer base 
the increase in professional services is due to our continued focus on providing additional capacity via third party resources 
the increase in professional services in was due primarily to more effective selling of our services to the company s installed base of customers 
the increase in maintenance and support in was attributable primarily to an inflationary index related increase in rates 
during fiscal years  and  no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
international revenue was million  million and million  or  and of total revenues  in  and  respectively

sales and marketing expenses decreased in and increased in the decrease in is as a result of the attrition we experienced at the end of and the early part of the increase in was due to the increased marketing efforts in the health care vertical and regional marketing expenses during the first half of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for human resources  finance  accounting  facilities  information technology and legal employees 
general and administrative expenses increased in and decreased in the increase in is due to increased investment in outside professional services 
the decrease in was due to reduced costs for regulatory reporting and lower professional services 
purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges

other income  net 
other income  net for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands year ended december  compared to compared to interest income other income expense  net other income expense  net is composed of recognized investment gains  foreign currency exchange realized and unrealized gains losses  gains on sale of intellectual property and or disposed equipment and purchase accounting credits 
other income expense  net increased in as compared to due to a million increase in foreign currency exchange realized and unrealized gains  a million one time gain on the sale of intellectual property in the first quarter of  a million accrual adjustment in the fourth quarter of  offset slightly by a million purchase accounting credit recorded by the company in the first quarter of related to the releasing of a liability recorded for the tower technology purchase in the first quarter of interest income increased in as compared to due to the higher cash balances and higher yields on invested funds 
other income expense  net decreased in as compared to due to a one time gain on the sale of equity investments in in the amount of approximately million 
the gain on the sale of equity investments in was due to the sale of equity securities in privately held technology companies  the largest of which was a sale of shopzilla for approximately million to ew scripps company  in which the company owned approximately 
the company had no carrying cost in the asset at the time of the sale due to previous impairment charges 
provision for benefit from income taxes income tax expense consists primarily of estimated withholdings and income taxes due in certain foreign jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to compared to provision for income taxes our accounting for deferred taxes under sfas involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in  we released million of the valuation 
table of contents allowance we had recorded against our net deferred tax asset based on the determination that it is now more likely than not that part of the benefit related to the net operating loss carryforward will be realized 
approximately million of the benefit from release of the valuation allowance was recorded as a benefit to our income tax provision and the remaining million related to assets of acquired companies and was recorded as a reduction of goodwill 
in concluding that releasing part of the valuation allowance was appropriate  we have considered such factors as our operating history and our ability  based on a projection  to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the relevant jurisdictions in future years 
we cannot currently estimate the changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance that may be appropriate in future periods 
as of december   we had domestic federal net operating loss  research and development credit and capital loss carry forwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these domestic net operating loss  research and development credit and capital loss carry forwards will expire at various dates  between and  if not utilized 
the company also had foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that are not subject to expiration 
internal revenue code section and similar foreign statutes impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses  tax credits and capital loss carry forwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
domestic net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and tax credit carry forwards of million at december  were incurred by businesses we acquired and are subject to annual limitation 
the remaining tax attributes that would be subject to annual limitations upon an ownership change include domestic net operating loss carry forwards of million  foreign net operating loss carry forwards of million  capital loss carry forwards of million and research and development credit carry forwards of million 
based upon a review of historical stock ownership  we do not believe we have undergone an ownership change that will severely limit our ability to utilize these tax attributes prior to their expiration 
in the event that an ownership change occurs in the future  application of the change in ownership statutes might result in substantial limitation on the utilization of these tax attributes from that point forward
