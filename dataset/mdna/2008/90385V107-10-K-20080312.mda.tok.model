item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to provide an understanding of ultra clean technology s business and results of operations 
this md a should be read in conjunction with ultra clean s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
md a consists of the following sections overview a summary of ultra clean s business 
results of operations a discussion of operating results 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations and financial position 
critical accounting policies a discussion of our critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates 
overview general we are a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems  primarily for the semiconductor capital equipment sce industry 
we also leverage the specialized skill sets required to support sce to serve the technologically similar markets in the flat panel  solar and medical device industries  collectively referred to as other addressed industries 
we develop  design  prototype  engineer  manufacture and test subsystems which are highly specialized and tailored to specific steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process as well as in other addressed markets 
our revenue is derived from the sale of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including chemical mechanical planarization cmp subsystems  chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies  process modules and other high level assemblies 
our customers are primarily original semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the industries we support 
we provide our customers with complete subsystem solutions that combine our expertise in design  test  component characterization and highly flexible manufacturing operations with quality control and financial stability 
this combination helps us drive down total manufacturing costs  reduce design to delivery cycle times and maintain high quality standards for our customers 
we believe these characteristics  as well as our standing as a leading supplier of gas delivery systems  place us in a strong position to benefit from the growing demand for subsystem outsourcing 
we operate clean room manufacturing facilities in menlo park and south san francisco  california  austin  texas  tualatin  oregon  and shanghai  china 
we also operate machine shop facilities in south san francisco as well as our new facility in shanghai  china 
we have in the past considered and will continue to consider acquisitions that will enable us to expand our geographic presence  secure new customers and diversify into complementary products and markets as well as broaden our technological capabilities in semiconductor capital equipment manufacturing 
cyclical business our business and operating results depend in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical  with recurring periods of over supply of semiconductor products that have had a severe negative effect on the demand for capital equipment used to manufacture semiconductors 
during these periods  we have experienced significant fluctuations in customer orders for our products 
our sales were million in  million in and million in in periods where supply exceeds demand for semiconductor capital equipment  we generally experience significant reductions in customer orders for our products 
sharp decreases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment may lead our customers to cancel order forecasts  change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay 
table of contents production  which may negatively impact our gross profit  as we may be unable to quickly reduce costs and may be required to hold inventory longer than anticipated 
in periods where demand for semiconductor capital equipment exceeds supply  we generally need to quickly increase our production of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems  requiring us to order additional inventory  effectively manage our component supply chain  hire additional employees and expand  if necessary  our manufacturing capacity 
customer and geographic concentration a relatively small number of oem customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect this trend to continue 
applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc collectively accounted for of our sales in  of our sales in and of our sales in because of the small number of oems in our industry  most of whom are already our customers  it would be difficult to replace lost revenue resulting from the loss of  reduction in  cancellation of or delay in purchase orders by  any one of these customers 
consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
in addition  any significant pricing pressure exerted by a key customer could adversely affect our operating results 
we have had to qualify  and are required to maintain our status  as a supplier for each of our customers 
this is a lengthy process that involves the inspection and approval by a customer of our engineering  documentation  manufacturing and quality control procedures before that customer will place volume orders 
our ability to lessen the adverse effect of any loss of or reduction in sales to an existing customer through the rapid addition of one or more new customers is minimal because of these qualification requirements 
consequently  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected by the loss of  or any reduction in orders by  any of our significant customers 
in  and   and  respectively  of our total sales were derived from sales outside the united states  based upon the location to which our products were shipped 
results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue year ended december  december  december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes income tax provision net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase reflects continued market penetration and strong demand in the first six months of  offset  in part  by a decrease in demand resulting from the overall slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment market in the second half of the increase includes incremental revenue of million derived from the acquisition of uct sieger 
we expect sequential revenues to be relatively flat in the first quarter of historically  a relatively small number of oem customers have accounted for a significant portion of our sales 
applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc are our three largest customers and each has greater than of our total sales 
as a percentage of total revenue  sales to our three largest customers combined were  and for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  gross profit for the year ended reflects a correction in inventory resulting from incorrect material transfers in our newly implemented erp system  which increased our cost of goods sold by  and decreased gross margins by from the reported in our earnings release dated february  the increase in gross profit from was due primarily to an increase in revenues  net of a decrease of approximately million resulting from a reduction in gross margins  primarily from our us operations 
the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to declining  sequential quarterly revenue beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  and the increased pressure on pricing associated with shrinking market demand 
a contributing factor to the decrease in the gross margin in related to the increase in sfas r stock based compensation expense of million 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment  design and implementation  new product design and testing and other product development activities 
research and development expense remained relatively flat decreasing to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of sales for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a higher revenue base in as compared to sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with our sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our products 
sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increased spending was due primarily to approximately million in additional compensation expense as a result of increases in sales and service headcount to support higher revenue including the sieger revenue 
the balance of the increase was attributed primarily to increased travel expenses of million and million of sfas r stock compensation expense 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead of our administrative staff and professional fees 
general and administrative expense increased to million  or of sales  for the year 
table of contents ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in spending was due to increases in labor costs of million in part related to the addition of uct sieger administrative personnel as well as increases in administrative personnel related to our china facilities 
the increase is also due to accounting and consulting costs related to sox compliance of million  legal fees related primarily to legal proceedings described above in item legal proceedings of million and sfas r stock compensation expenses of million 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for the year ended december  was million compared to million in components of interest and other income expense relate primarily to the interest expense incurred for debt financing related to the sieger acquisition 
interest expense for the year was million compared to million in the increase in was due to interest on debt incurred for a full year in compared to interest on debt incurred for only a part of as a result of the acquisition of sieger in june this increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately million as well as a decrease in other expense of approximately million 
other expense in fiscal included approximately million of stock offering expenses related to our secondary offering in the first quarter of income tax provision our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our effective tax rate is substantially impacted by several items including section deduction for domestic production activities  state taxes and the effect of foreign operations 
the decreased rate in reflects primarily a change in our geographic mix of us and china earnings 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase reflected  primarily  a rebound in demand that began during the first quarter of and  to a lesser extent  incremental revenue derived from the acquisition of sieger 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit was due primarily to an increase in the percentage of revenue generated from our shanghai facility  as well as improved margins from our us operations 
this increase was partially offset by sfas r stock based compensation expense of million 
research and development expense research and development expense increased to million or of sales for the year ended december  from million  or of sales for the year ended the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to an increase in engineering activity related to new product design and other product development activity and million of sfas r stock based compensation expenses 
the decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a higher revenue base in as compared to sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increased spending was due primarily to approximately million in additional compensation expense resulting from increases in commissions and sales and service headcount to support higher revenue and the balance of the increase was primarily attributed to increased travel expense and million of sfas r stock compensation expenses 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense 
table of contents decreased to for the year ended december  compared to of sales for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a higher revenue base in compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in spending was due to accounting and consulting costs relating to sox compliance  million of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired through the sieger acquisition  legal fees related to certain legal proceedings  million of sfas r stock compensation expenses and the addition of uct sieger administrative personnel 
the decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a higher revenue base in as compared to interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million in the decrease in interest and other income expense  net over the comparable prior period is attributable primarily to the interest expense incurred for debt financing related to the sieger acquisition 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was substantially impacted by several items including the extraterritorial income exclusion eti  section deduction for domestic production activities and the effect of foreign operations 
the increased rate in reflected primarily a decrease in the tax benefit associated with the eti exclusion and a change in our geographic mix of worldwide earnings that contributed to a year end adjustment related to transfer pricing 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  business combinations  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and equity incentives to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenue is concentrated in a few oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment  solar  flat panel and medical device industry 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  
table of contents customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not substantially completed a product or fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until completion 
determination of criteria in the third and fourth bullet points above is based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the amounts charged for the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced significant collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we value the majority of our inventories at the lesser of standard cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we value inventory of our subsidiary  uct sieger  at the lesser of actual cost or market 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory 
for the years ended december  and december   we wrote off million and million  respectively  in inventory determined to be obsolete 
accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowance to impair our tax assets because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
on december   we adopted the provision of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
when tax returns are filed  it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for recognized tax benefits in the 
table of contents accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination see note 
we are currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the internal revenue service for fiscal years through  and our state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for fiscal years through business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets such as trade name and customer relationships 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
on june   we completed the acquisition of sieger engineering  inc  a privately held contract manufacturing company based in south san francisco  california uct sieger 
the total purchase price was approximately million and was comprised of cash consideration of million  including acquisition costs of million  and stock consideration of million 
our subsidiary  uct sieger  is a supplier of chemical mechanical planarization cmp modules and other critical subsystems to the semiconductor  solar and flat panel capital equipment industries 
we believe that the acquisition has enhanced our strategic position as a semiconductor equipment subsystem supplier 
we have accounted for the acquisition of uct sieger as a business combination and the operating results of uct sieger have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
see note 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we annually evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill  customer lists and tradename 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the provisions of sfas no 
also require a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  the provisions of sfas no 
require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we operate in one reportable segment and have one reporting unit 
therefore  all goodwill is considered enterprise goodwill and the first step of the impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires a comparison of our fair value to our book value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the book value  sfas no 
requires an estimate of the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this estimate requires valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development and developed technology 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon this two step process 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
equity incentives to employees on january   we began to account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and employee stock based compensation plan in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial account standards r accounting for stock based compensation  sfas r  which requires recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of stock based compensation awards less 
table of contents the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in the consolidated income statements 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  and fasb interpretation fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  fin and made footnote disclosures as required by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas 
accordingly  no compensation was recognized for purchase rights issued through the employee stock purchase plan or employee stock based awards granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
rather  we disclosed pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements as required by sfas the pro forma income calculations were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
unaudited quarterly financial results the following tables set forth statement of operations data  in thousands  for the periods indicated 
the information for each of these periods is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included herein and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our unaudited operations data for the periods presented 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future in thousands first second third fourth fiscal quarter quarter quarter quarter year sales gross profit net income sales gross profit net income our operating results for fiscal reflect a downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry beginning in the second quarter of and worsening further in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year gross profit for the fourth quarter and full year ended reflects a correction in inventory resulting from incorrect material transfers in our newly implemented erp system which increased our cost of goods sold by  from amounts previously reported in our earnings release dated february  on a comparative basis  the operations of sieger are included in the operating results above beginning in the third quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources with the exception of the sieger acquisition  which was funded by third party debt  historically  we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt obligations  maintain our equipment and purchase new capital equipment 
as of december   we had cash of million as compared to million as of december  for the year ended december  we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to a use of cash of million for the year ended december  cash flow in was favorably impacted by increases in net income and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million respectively  offset in part by an increase in inventory of million  and a decease in income taxes payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  decreased million to million 
the decrease was due primarily to our acquisition of sieger in offset by higher levels of capital 
table of contents expenditures relating to our investment in a new erp system and leasehold and capital equipment for our second manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
in addition to our normal general capital expenditures  in  we expect to invest approximately million in our new hayward facility and million in our new shanghai facility over the next four years 
cash for these investments will be provided from existing cash and cash from operations 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  increased million to million used in financing activities from million provided by financing activities in the year ended december  in the use of cash in financing activities was primarily due to payments on long term debt of million offset primarily by proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock compensation plans 
in  we generated cash primarily through bank borrowings and stock issuance  including approximately million in net proceeds from our secondary stock offering of million shares of common stock conducted in march cash provided by financing activities in was used primarily to fund the acquisition of sieger 
we anticipate that our operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital lease obligations  expansion plans and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
borrowing arrangements in connection with our acquisition of sieger in the second quarter of  we entered into a borrowing arrangement and an equipment loan 
the loan and security agreement loan agreement provides senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  consisting of a million revolving line of credit million of which may be used for the issuance of letters of credit and a million term loan 
the aggregate amount of the credit facilities is also subject to a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
each of the credit facilities will expire on june  and contains certain financial covenants  including minimum profitability and liquidity ratios 
in addition  the term loan is subject to monthly amortization payments in equal installments 
in december  we paid down the balance of this loan by an additional amount of million 
interest rates on outstanding loans under the credit facilities ranged from to per annum during the year ended december  and were per annum as of december  the equipment loan is a year  million loan that is secured by certain equipment 
the interest rate on the equipment loan was as of december  the combined balance outstanding on the borrowing arrangement and equipment loan at december  was million 
we anticipate that we will continue to finance our operations with cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and a combination of long term debt and or lease financing and additional sales of equity securities 
the combination and sources of capital will be determined by management based on our then current needs and prevailing market conditions 
although cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
capital expenditures we made capital expenditures of million in the year ended december   the majority of which was used for the facilities expansion in china and the implementation of our new erp system which went live during the fourth quarter of capital expenditures in the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively  the majority of which was domestic cleanroom expansion activities and the purchase and implementation of a new erp system 

table of contents contractual obligations other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  we have no off balance sheet transactions  unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments and  other than the revolving credit facility described above  are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
the following table summarizes our future minimum lease payments and principal payments under debt obligations as of december  in thousands thereafter total capital lease operating lease borrowing arrangements purchase obligations total operating lease expense reflects a the lease for our headquarters facility in menlo park  california expires on december  and we have entered into a new lease in hayward  california  b the lease for a manufacturing facility in portland  oregon expires on october   c the leases for manufacturing facilities in south san francisco expire in   and  d three leases for manufacturing facilities in austin  texas that expire on february  and august  we have options to renew certain of the leases in south san francisco  which we expect to exercise 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on december  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recorded an additional tax liability of  to offset the recognition of previously recorded excess tax benefits 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future payment of these liabilities  the amounts have been excluded from the table above 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will adopt sfas as required in january and are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
which allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates 
such election  which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  is irrevocable once elected 
sfas no 
will be effective in fiscal we are evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement revised  business combinations sfas r 
the standard changes the accounting for business combinations  including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination  the recognition of contingent consideration  the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies  the recognition of capitalized in process research and development  the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals  the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs  and the recognition of changes in the acquirer s income tax valuation allowance 
sfas r will be effective for ultra clean technology in fiscal  with early adoption prohibited 
ultra clean is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of statement r on its financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates or equity prices 
foreign exchange rates during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a loan and security agreement providing for revolver loans of up to million with a bank in china 
as of december   we had no such balance outstanding under the revolver loan under such agreement 
however  if we enter into future borrowing arrangements or borrow under our existing revolving credit facility  we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate changes by using a mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt  together with interest rate swaps where appropriate  to fix or lower our borrowing costs 
we do not make material sales in currencies other than the united states dollar or have material purchase obligations outside of the united states  except in china where we have purchase commitments totaling million in united states dollar equivalents 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates applied to the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
although we do not anticipate any significant fluctuations  there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange risk will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future 
interest rates our interest rate risk relates primarily to our third party debt which totals million and carries interest rates pegged to the libor and prime rates 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by increased interest income on our invested cash 
conversely  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates would decrease our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by decreased interest income on our invested cash
