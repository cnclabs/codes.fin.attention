item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
business overview we are a life science company focused on the development and commercialization of genomic based clinical diagnostic tests for cancer that allow physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions 
our diagnostic test  oncotype dx  is used for early stage breast cancer patients to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit 
all tumor samples are sent to our laboratory in redwood city  california for analysis 
upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician  we generally bill third party payors for oncotype dx 
effective june   we increased the list price of our test from  to  we have experienced a significant increase in demand for oncotype dx since the test was launched in january for the year ended december   more than  test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning  compared to more than  and more than  tests delivered for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   more than  tests had been delivered for use in treatment planning by more than  physicians 
we believe this increased demand resulted from the continued publication of peer reviewed articles on studies we sponsored  conducted or collaborated on that support the use and reimbursement of oncotype dx  clinical presentations at major symposia  inclusion of oncotype dx in clinical practice guidelines  and the expansion of our domestic field sales organization 
however  this increased demand is not necessarily indicative of future growth rates  and we cannot assure you that this level of increased demand can be sustained or that future appearances or presentations at medical conferences  publication of articles or increases in sales personnel will have similar impact on demand for oncotype dx 
we believe that each year we may experience slower growth in demand for our test in the second and third calendar quarters  which may be attributed to physicians  surgeons and patients scheduling vacations during this time 
substantially all of our tests to date have been delivered to physicians in the united states 
one payor  medicare  as administered by national heritage insurance company  or nhic  accounted for approximately and of our product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
another payor  united healthcare insurance company  accounted for approximately of our product revenues in as of december   our laboratory had the capacity to process up to  tests per quarter 
we believe that with additional equipment and personnel  the capacity of our existing facility can be significantly increased in the future 
since our inception  we have generated significant net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect our net losses to continue for at least the next year 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts over the next several years will be focused on research and development  both to develop additional tests for breast cancer and to develop tests for colon and other cancers  to scale up our commercial organization  and for other general corporate purposes 
our financial results will be limited by a number of factors  including establishment of coverage policies by third party insurers and government payors  our ability in the short term to collect from payors  which often requires that we pursue a case by case manual appeals process  and our ability to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as tests are performed and reports are delivered 
unless a contract or policy is in place with a payor at the time of billing and collectibility from that payor is reasonably assured  we recognize revenue when cash is received 
we do not expect to recognize the majority of revenues from our current customers on an accrual basis until the end of or later 
adoption and reimbursement in december  the national comprehensive cancer network  or nccn  included the use of oncotype dx to set treatment planning in its breast cancer treatment guidelines 
in october  the american society of clinical oncologists  or asco  issued updated clinical practice guidelines that include the use of oncotype dx to predict the likelihood of disease recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit for node negative  or n  
table of contents estrogen receptor positive  or er  early stage breast cancer patients 
in july  the blue cross and blue shield association technology evaluation center concluded that the use of oncotype dx to inform decision making about adjuvant chemotherapy meets its criteria for women with n  er tumors who have been treated with tamoxifen 
in addition to the inclusion of oncotype dx in these clinical treatment guidelines  we believe the key factors that will drive broader adoption of oncotype dx will be acceptance by healthcare providers of its clinical benefits  demonstration of the cost effectiveness of using our test  expanded reimbursement by third party payors  and increased marketing and sales efforts 
as of december   cigna healthcare  humana  inc  health net  inc  united healthcare insurance company  aetna  inc  kaiser foundation health plan  inc and nhic had issued positive coverage determinations for oncotype dx 
wellpoint  inc  a leading health benefits provider  adopted a policy covering oncotype dx with certain restrictions 
in january  medi cal  our first medicaid payor  established a policy covering our test 
in addition  a number of regional payors  including many regional blue cross and blue shield providers  have issued policies supporting reimbursement for oncotype dx 
as of february  more than of all us insured lives were covered by health plans that provide reimbursement for oncotype dx through contracts  agreements and policy decisions 
in late  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  announced that palmetto government benefits administrators  or palmetto  will be replacing nhic as the medicare administrative contractor with jurisdiction over claims submitted by us to medicare 
medicare claims processing responsibility will transition from nhic to palmetto over the next several months with palmetto expected to assume full responsibility by the summer of it is possible that palmetto will adopt different coverage or payment policies from those of nhic  and its policies may not include reimbursement for oncotype dx or may provide for reimbursement on different terms than are presently in effect 
product pipeline we are conducting studies with the goal of expanding the clinical utility of oncotype dx in breast cancer 
in february  we introduced quantitative gene expression reporting for er and pr with the oncotype dx recurrence score report to provide better information for improved treatment decision making 
we are also conducting studies using oncotype dx in n  er patients who were treated with an aromatase inhibitor 
at the june asco meeting  we presented a study suggesting that oncotype dx recurrence score results provide accurate recurrence risk information for patients with er breast cancer  regardless of whether they were n or n 
at the december sabcs  we presented results from a second study suggesting that oncotype dx may be useful in predicting survival without disease recurrence and the benefit of chemotherapy for n patients  in addition to those with n  er breast cancer 
we currently provide oncotype dx for n patients through a medical consultation 
we also plan to investigate the utility of oncotype dx in patients with dcis  a pre invasive form of breast cancer 
most of our existing reimbursement coverage is specifically for women with early stage n  er breast cancer 
we may not be able to obtain reimbursement coverage for oncotype dx for post menopausal female breast cancer patients who are n  er patients that is similar to the coverage we have obtained for early stage n  er patients 
we continue to conduct research and development studies in a variety of cancers other than breast cancer 
for example  we have now identified multiple genes that have been observed to be statistically significantly correlated to clinical outcome in colon cancer 
we expect to conduct analytical validation work with the final gene set and algorithm and a clinical validation study in in addition  we entered into a collaboration with pfizer for the development of a genomic test to estimate the risk of recurrence following surgery for patients with stage i iii renal carcinoma  clear cell type  which is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
table of contents united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we generally bill third party payors for oncotype dx upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with the third party payor 
we usually bill the patient directly for amounts owed after multiple requests for payment have been denied or only partially paid by the insurance carrier 
as a relatively new test  oncotype dx may be considered investigational by some payors and not covered under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we pursue case by case reimbursement where policies are not in place 
our product revenues for tests performed are recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
criterion is satisfied when we have an agreement or contract with the payor in place  or when the payor has issued a policy addressing reimbursement for our oncotype dx test 
criterion is satisfied when we perform the test and generate and deliver a recurrence score report to the physician 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered  contractual agreements entered into  and the collectibility of those fees under any contract or agreement 
when evaluating collectibility  we consider whether we can reliably estimate a payor s individual payment patterns 
based upon at least several months of payment history  we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor s outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the contracted payment amount 
product revenues where all criteria set forth above are not met are recognized when cash is received from the payor 
product revenues for oncotype dx  from its commercial launch in january through december   have largely been recognized on a cash basis due to a limited number of contracts or agreements with third party payors and limited collections experience 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  we recognized a portion of product revenue from third party payors  including some private payors and medicare  on an accrual basis when the criteria described in the preceding paragraph were satisfied 
contract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract specific basis 
under certain contracts  our input  measured in terms of full time equivalent level of effort or running a set of assays through our laboratory under a contractual protocol  triggers payment obligations and revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed 
certain contracts have payment obligations that are triggered as milestones are complete  such as completion of a successful set of experiments 
in these cases  revenues are recognized when the milestones are achieved under contracts that satisfy our other revenue recognition criteria 
allowance for doubtful accounts in late we began accruing an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable consistent with historical payment experience 
bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
accounts receivable are written off against the allowance when the appeals process is exhausted  when an unfavorable coverage decision is received  or when there is other substantive evidence that the account will not be paid 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
write offs for doubtful accounts of  were recorded against the 
table of contents allowance during the year ended december   no write offs were recorded against the allowance during the year ended december  changes in our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts resulted in a  credit to bad debt expense for the year ended december  bad debt expense was  for the year ended december  no bad debt expense was recorded for the year ended december  because the vast majority of revenues were recorded on a cash basis 
stock based compensation expense through december   we accounted for stock based payment transactions under accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for stock based payment transactions whereby an entity receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments  including stock options 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based payment transactions using the intrinsic value method under apb  and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the application of sfas r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions used in determining fair value 
we use the black scholes valuation method  which requires the use of estimates such as stock price volatility and expected options lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value stock based compensation 
we have limited historical evidence with respect to developing these assumptions 
our common stock has been publicly traded for less than three years  so our expected volatility is based primarily on comparable peer data 
the expected life of options granted is estimated based on historical option exercise data and assumptions related to unsettled options 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted under sfas r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered beginning on january  stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r represents expense related to stock options granted on or after january   as well as stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january  as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options  net of estimated forfeitures  was million 
we expect to recognize this expense over a weighted average period of months 
equity instruments granted to non employees are valued using the black scholes method and accounted for as prescribed by sfas r and emerging issues task force  or eitf  consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and will be subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms 
clinical collaborator costs we enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses 
we record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms 
under one of our collaboration agreements  we make fixed annual payments resulting from the commercial launch of oncotype dx 
the expense related to these payments is recorded as license fee expense 
we recognize the accrued liability and related expense ratably over the year before the relevant payment is made 
if at any time we discontinue the sale of commercial products or services resulting from the collaboration  including oncotype dx  no future milestone payments will be payable and we will have no further obligation under the agreement 
results of operations years ended december  and we recorded net loss for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents revenues we derive our revenues from product sales and contract research arrangements 
we operate in one industry segment 
our product revenues are derived solely from the sale of our oncotype dx test 
payors are billed upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician 
product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or policy is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as contractual obligations are completed 
total revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product revenues from oncotype dx were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in product revenues resulted from increased adoption  reflected by a increase in test volume year over year  and expanded reimbursement coverage  resulting in an increase in the amount paid per test 
as in prior periods  the majority of product revenues were recognized upon cash collection as payments were received 
approximately million  or  of product revenue for the year ended december  was recorded on an accrual basis  reflecting established payment patterns from payors with coverage policies in place  compared to million  or  of product revenue for the year ended december  product revenue from medicare for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenue compared to million  or  for the year ended december  medicare revenue for the year ended december  included the receipt of million in payments for services provided to medicare patients prior to medicare s february  effective coverage date for oncotype dx 
contract revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
contract revenues represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners 
the decrease in contract revenues was due to project timing for our collaboration with aventis and the eastern cooperative oncology group  partially offset by an increase in revenue from our ongoing work with bristol myers squibb and imclone systems 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues represents the cost of materials  direct labor  equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples including histopathology  anatomical pathology  paraffin extraction  rt pcr and quality control analyses  shipping charges to transport tissue samples and license fees 
infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
costs associated with performing our test are recorded as tests are processed 
costs recorded for tissue sample processing and shipping charges represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
license fees for royalties due on product revenues and contractual obligations are recorded in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations 
license fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million for oncotype dx  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million  license fees of million and shipping charges of million 
for the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million  license fees of million and shipping charges of  test volume increased year over year  driving the million  or  increase in tissue processing costs 
the increase in tissue sampling costs for also reflected higher infrastructure expenses related to facilities expansion and improvements 
the million increase in license fees included higher royalties due to an increase of million  or  in product revenues recognized 
the  increase in shipping charges reflected increased test volume and higher international shipping costs 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and to carry out our clinical studies to validate our multi gene tests and include personnel related expenses  infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
all potential future product programs outside of breast and colon cancer are in the research or early development phase 
the expected time frame in which a test for one of these other cancers can be brought to market is uncertain given the technical challenges and clinical variables that exist between different types of cancers 
we do not record or maintain information regarding costs incurred in research and development on a program or project specific basis  including activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
our research and development staff and associated infrastructure resources are deployed across several programs 
many of our costs are thus not attributable to individual programs 
as a result  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development programs or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in infrastructure expenses  including facilities expansion and improvements  a  increase in costs incurred for reagents and lab supplies and a  increase in travel related expenses  partially offset by a  decrease in collaboration expense related to timing of projects 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we increase investment in our product pipeline for a variety of cancers  including cancers other than breast and colon 
selling and marketing expenses our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  education and promotional expenses associated with oncotype dx  and infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
these expenses include the costs of educating physicians  laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding our genomic technologies  how our oncotype dx test was developed and validated and the value of the quantitative information that oncotype dx provides 
selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education  medical meeting participation and dissemination of our scientific and economic publications related to oncotype dx 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in selling and marketing expenses was due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  due mostly to the expansion of our domestic field sales and support organization  million in higher travel related expenses primarily associated with field personnel  a million increase in promotional field and marketing expense and a million increase in infrastructure expenses  including facilities expansion and improvements 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to an increase in the number of selling and marketing personnel 
the average cost per employee remained constant year over year 
we expect that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we expand our marketing and sales programs  including ongoing physician and patient education programs 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  legal costs  including intellectual property defense and prosecution costs  advisory and auditing expenses  billing and collection costs  bad debt expense  and other professional and administrative costs  and related infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in general and administrative expenses included a million increase in personnel related expense due primarily to an increase in headcount year over year   in higher billing and collection fees paid to third party billing and collection vendors  a  increase in infrastructure expenses  including facilities expansion and improvements  a  increase in advocacy and industry relations expenses  a  increase in legal fees  a  increase in travel related expenses and a  increase in costs for third party service providers related to being a public company  including investor relations 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense due to changes in our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts which resulted in a  credit to bad debt expense for the year ended december  we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we spend more on fees for billing and collections due to revenue growth and continue to incur costs associated with regulatory matters and other expenses associated with the growth of our business 
interest and other income interest and other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to increased interest income from higher average short term investment balances resulting from our investment of a large portion of the cash proceeds from our may public offering of common stock and higher market yields 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   reflecting interest expense incurred on our equipment financing line established at the end of march under which draws have been made and interest expense has been incurred 
years ended december  and we recorded net loss for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss per basic and diluted share was primarily due to an increase in weighted average shares outstanding related to our initial public offering of common stock which closed on october  revenues total revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product revenues from oncotype dx were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately million  or  of product revenue for the year ended december  was recorded on an accrual basis compared to  or  for the year ended december  the majority of product revenue was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received 
product revenue from medicare was million  representing of total product revenue for the year ended december   we had no product revenue from medicare in this increase was a result of the february  effective coverage date for medicare patients and the receipt of payments for tests provided to medicare patients prior to the effective coverage date 
contract revenues were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in contract revenues reflected the initiation of the collaboration with aventis  inc  and the eastern cooperative oncology group as well as our ongoing work with bristol myers squibb and imclone systems 
cost of product revenues for the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million for oncotype dx  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million  license fees of million and shipping charges of  for 
table of contents the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million  license fees of  and shipping charges of  test volume for the year ended december  more than doubled over the prior year  resulting in a decrease in the cost per test delivered 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in collaboration expense and a  increase in infrastructure expenses 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in promotional field and marketing expense   in higher travel related expenses associated with field personnel and a  increase in infrastructure expenses 
we expanded our domestic field sales force to support oncotype dx in the second half of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in general and administrative expenses included a million increase in personnel related expenses  million in higher billing and collection fees paid to third party billing and collection vendors  an increase of million in legal and accounting fees  an increase of  in infrastructure expenses  an increase of  in expense to establish a bad debt reserve against accounts receivable  an increase of  in insurance related expense and an increase of  in costs for third party service providers related to being a public company  including investor relations 
interest and other income interest and other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   the million increase was due to increased interest income from higher average cash balances and higher market yields 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for year ended december  the  increase was related to higher borrowings on our equipment financing line established at the end of march  under which draws have been made and interest expense has been incurred 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since our inception in august  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next year 
we expect that our research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and  as a result  we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability 
we may never achieve profitability 
in thousands as of december cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital for the year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources of liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash and short term investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including money market accounts  obligations of us government agencies and government sponsored entities  high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper 
in accordance with our investment policy  available cash is invested in short term  low risk  investment grade debt instruments 
historically we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and cash received from customers 
in october  we completed an initial public offering and a concurrent private placement of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in may  we completed a public offering of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements have been partially financed through capital equipment financing arrangements 
at december  and  we had notes payable under these equipment financing arrangements of million and million  respectively 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities includes net loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
the million decrease in net cash used in operating activities from to was primarily due to a million decrease in net loss excluding depreciation and stock based compensation expense and a  decrease in net cash used related to increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in net cash used related to increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets and a million increase in cash used due to a decrease in accounts payable

our financing activities include sales of our equity securities and capital equipment financing arrangements 
the million increase in net cash provided by financing activities from to includes net proceeds of million from our may public offering of common stock  partially offset by a million decrease in cash provided by capital equipment financing 
the million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities from to reflects the impact of net proceeds of million from our october initial public offering 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands notes payable obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations total our notes payable obligations are for principal and interest payments on capital equipment financing 
in march  we entered into an arrangement to finance the acquisition of laboratory equipment  computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
in connection with this arrangement  we granted the lender a security interest in the assets purchased with these borrowings 
beginning in april  we could prepay all  but not part  of any amounts owing under the arrangement so long as we also paid a premium on the remaining outstanding principal balance 
this premium was reduced to in april and will be reduced to in april as of december   the outstanding principal balance under this arrangement was million at annual interest rates ranging from to  depending upon the applicable note 
our non cancelable operating lease obligations are for laboratory and office space 
in september  we entered into a non cancelable lease for  square feet of laboratory and office space in redwood city  california 
in january  we entered into a non cancelable lease for an additional  square feet of laboratory and office space in a nearby location 
both leases expire in february in addition to the above  we are required to make a series of fixed annual payments under one of our collaboration agreements beginning on the date that we commercially launched oncotype dx 
for a period of seven years on each anniversary of this first payment  we are required to make additional payments in increasing amounts 
the initial payment of  was made in january payments of   and  were made in january  and  respectively 
we are required to make additional payments of  in each of through however  because either party may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice  these payments are not included in the table above 
we have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our collaboration agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of specific project milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is generally neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such commitments have not been included in the table above 

table of contents off balance sheet activities as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements other than the lease obligations and collaboration payments discussed above 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future and to make capital expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and development programs and to scale our commercial operations 
it may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund working capital and for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  such as licensing technology rights  partnering arrangements for our tests outside the united states or reduction of debt obligations 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
we have no current plans  agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition or investment  and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to any such transaction 
the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the progress of our product development  regulatory requirements  commercialization efforts  the amount of cash used by operations and progress in reimbursement 
as reimbursement contracts with third party payors continue to be put into place  we expect an increase in the number and level of payments received for oncotype dx billings 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with collections from oncotype dx and amounts available under our equipment credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our operations and facility expansion plans for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that any of our reimbursement contract programs or development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these programs through to a successful result 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  the cost of expanding our commercial and laboratory operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of oncotype dx for breast cancer  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with products in the early development and development phase focused on cancers other than breast cancer  the cost of acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations 
the issuance of equity securities may result in dilution to stockholders  or may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock 
if we raise funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock
