item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business track data corporation the company is a financial services company that provides real time financial market data  fundamental research  charting and analytical services to institutional and individual investors through dedicated telecommunication lines and the internet 
the company also disseminates news and third party database information from more than sources worldwide 
the company owns tdsc  a registered securities broker dealer and member of finra 
the company provides a proprietary  fully integrated internet based online trading and market data system  protrack  for the professional institutional traders  and mytrack and mytrack edge  for the individual trader 
the company also operates track ecn  an electronic communications network that enables traders to display and match limit orders for stocks 
the company s operations are classified in three business segments professional market market data services and trading  including ecn services  to the institutional professional investment community  non professional market internet based online trading and market data services to the non professional individual investor community  and arbitrage trading 
relevant factors the company s professional market segment revenues experienced significant declines since from a combination of staffing reductions in the securities industry  the use by customers of internally developed services  or lower priced services offered by the company or other vendors 
this trend has continued into until october   track ecn displayed orders submitted by its subscribers on nasdaq s trading platform 
broker dealers could access this liquidity through nasdaq 
nasdaq was authorized to operate as an exchange and track ecn was no longer able to operate its business on nasdaq s platform 
track ecn currently displays its orders on the national stock exchange 
this change has resulted in significantly lower revenues 
in addition  revenues were reduced in the second quarter of by a new regulation that limited ecn charges for trading of stocks under 
the company commenced self clearing of its ecn business at the end of the third quarter of in an effort to decrease costs associated with ecn revenues 
although tdsc has approval for clearing of its track ecn business  it is a limited approval for it to submit two sided trade data respecting trades which were executed by broker dealers on the track ecn 
tdsc submits this data to the national securities clearing corporation so that the actual trading counterparties can compare  clear and settle their trades and  except in the case of a rare error  tdsc drops out of the clearing process 
this effort to self clear was a step to reduce costs of having a third party handle this function 
the non professional market segment revenues have been inconsistent month to month 
the company is attempting to grow revenues in this segment  principally through marketing alliances and limited advertising to attract new customers  and by offering additional services to existing customers 
the company presently offers trading of us based stocks  options and e mini futures 
the trading and market data services for both segments require the company to maintain a market data ticker plant on a basis  as well as all back office trading functions 
the company s focus is to increase revenues in both segments  as the underlying costs of maintaining the operations and back office will not increase commensurate with any revenue increase  allowing greater operating margins on incremental revenues 
the company engages in arbitrage trading activity 
the company s trading strategy consists principally of establishing hedged positions consisting of stocks and options 
the company is subject to market risk in attempting to establish a hedged position  as the market prices could change  precluding a profitable hedge 
in these instances  any positions that were established for this hedge would be immediately sold  usually resulting in small losses 
if the hedged positions are successfully established at the prices sought  the positions generally stay until the next option expiration date  resulting in small gains  regardless of market value changes in these securities 
while virtually all positions are liquidated at option expiration date  certain stock positions remain 
the liquidation of these positions generally results in small profits or losses 
from time to time  losses may result from certain dividends that may have to be delivered on positions held  as well as from certain corporate restructurings and mergers that may not have been taken into account when the positions were originally established 
ii in connection with the arbitrage trading activity  the company incurs margin loans 
the company is exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to these margin loans 
the level of trading in the arbitrage trading account is partially dependent on the margin value of track data common stock pledged by its principal stockholder and innodata common stock  which is used as collateral 
the market value of such securities is dependent on future market conditions for these companies over which the company has little or no control

the line expires in october   subject to automatic renewal 
the company may borrow up to of eligible market data service receivables as defined  and is required to maintain a compensating balance of of the outstanding loans 
at december   the company had no borrowings under the line 
borrowings available on the line of credit at december  were  based on these formulas 
the company has significant positions in stocks and options and receives significant proceeds from the sale of trading securities sold but not yet purchased under the arbitrage trading strategy described in note c in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that its december  positions will be closed during the first quarter of and that other positions with the same strategy will be established

the company purchased  shares of its common stock in at a cost of  the purchases were paid with cash that was part of the total capital used in arbitrage trading 
in november   the board authorized the purchase of up to million shares from time to time in market purchases or in negotiated transactions 
since that authorization  the company purchased approximately  shares of its common stock for  no major capital expenditures are anticipated beyond the normal replacement of equipment and additional equipment to meet customer requirements 
the company believes that borrowings available under the company s line of credit  its present cash position  including cash available in its arbitrage trading  and any cash that may be generated from operations are sufficient for the company s cash requirements for the next months

off balance sheet risk in connection with the company s broker dealer operations  certain customer securities activities are transacted on a margin basis 
the company s clearing broker extends credit to the company s customers  subject to various regulatory margin requirements  collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
in the event of a decline in the market value of the securities in a margin account  the company is required to either obtain additional collateral from the customer or to sell the customer s position if such collateral is not forthcoming 
the company is responsible for any losses on such margin loans  and has agreed to indemnify its clearing broker for losses that the clearing broker may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by the company 
the company and its clearing broker seek to control the risks associated with customer activities by monitoring required margin levels daily and  pursuant to such guidelines  requiring the customer to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results when different assumptions are utilized 
we believe that our principal critical accounting policies are described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note a in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from market data and ecn services as services are performed 
billings in advance of services provided are recorded as unearned revenues 
all other revenues collected in advance of services are deferred until services are rendered 
the company earns commissions as an introducing broker and for licensing its trading system for the transactions of its customers 
commissions and related clearing expenses are recorded on a trade date basis as securities transactions occur 
ii for ecn services  transaction fees are earned on a per trade basis  based on shares transacted  and are recognized as transactions occur 
for each transaction executed  there is an associated liquidity payment or routing charge paid 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  the company records such expenses as liquidity payments or routing charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
marketable securities arbitrage marketable securities transactions are recorded on trade date 
gains and losses are recognized based on closed transactions and the difference between market value and cost at balance sheet date 
the company classifies its investments in innodata and edgar online as available for sale securities 
the company carries these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations when realized 
the company reviews these holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if the company believes that an other than temporary decline exists in the marketable securities  the equity investments are written down to market value and an investment loss is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated by the assets to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimated cash flows and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
new pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it codifies the definitions of fair value included in other authoritative literature  clarifies and  in some cases  expands on the guidance for implementing fair value measurements  and increases the level of disclosure required for fair value measurements 
although sfas applies to and amends the provisions of existing authoritative literature  it does not  of itself  require any new fair value measurements  nor does it establish valuation standards 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement will be effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january we will evaluate the impact of adopting sfas but do not expect that it will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
most of the provisions of sfas no 
apply only to entities that elect the fair value option 
however  the amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
the fair value option established by sfas no 
permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
the company has not completed its review of the new guidance 
ii in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary previously referred to as minority interests 
sfas also requires that a retained noncontrolling interest upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at its fair value 
upon adoption of sfas  the company would be required to report any noncontrolling interests as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company would also be required to present any net income allocable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to the stockholders of the company separately in its consolidated statements of income 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements of sfas shall be applied prospectively 
sfas would have an impact on the presentation and disclosure of the noncontrolling interests of any non wholly owned businesses acquired in the future 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for determining how an enterprise recognizes and measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including noncontrolling interests  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingencies 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
sfas r will be applicable prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas r would have an impact on accounting for any businesses acquired after the effective date of this pronouncement 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payment  which amends sab  share based payment  to permit public companies  under certain circumstances  to use the simplified method in sab for employee option grants after december  use of the simplified method after december is permitted only for companies whose historical data about their employees exercise behavior does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options 
the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation and seasonality to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company s revenues are not affected by seasonality 
ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to its credit facility with a financial institution  which is priced based on the prime rate of interest 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in the prime interest rate during fiscal will have a positive or negative effect on the company s interest expense 
such exposure will increase should the company maintain higher levels of borrowing during the company has significant positions in stocks and options and receives significant proceeds from the sale of trading securities sold but not yet purchased under the arbitrage trading strategy described in note c of notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the arbitrage trading activity  the company incurs margin loans 
the company is exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to these margin loans 
such exposure will increase should the company maintain higher levels of borrowing 
the level of trading in the arbitrage trading account is partially dependent on the value of the company s common stock pledged by its principal stockholder and innodata common stock  which is used as collateral 
the market value of such securities is dependent on future market conditions for these companies over which the company has little or no control 
if the stock collateral is not available  the company will decrease its trading or seek additional collateral 
the company s margin loans as of december  were immaterial 
the company conducts business through a clearing broker  which settles all trades for the company  on a fully disclosed basis  on behalf of its customers 
the company earns commissions as an introducing broker for the transactions of its customers 
in the normal course of business  the company s customer activities involve the execution of various customer securities transactions 
these activities may expose the company to off balance sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations and the company has to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the obligation at a loss 
at december   the company had million in margin credit extended to its customers
