item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel  proprietary products for the treatment of acute and intermittent conditions 
we currently have six product candidates in clinical development 
our technology  the staccato system  vaporizes an excipient free drug to form a condensation aerosol that  when inhaled  allows for rapid systemic drug delivery 
because of the particle size of the aerosol  the drug is quickly absorbed through the deep lung into the bloodstream  providing speed of therapeutic onset that is comparable to iv administration but with greater ease  patient comfort and convenience 
we have identified approximately drug compounds that have demonstrated initial vaporization feasibility for delivery with our technology 
we believe that a number of these drug compounds  when delivered by the staccato system  will have a desirable therapeutic profile for the treatment of acute and intermittent conditions 
we are initially focusing on developing proprietary products by combining our staccato system with small molecule drugs that have been in use for many years and are well characterized to create aerosolized forms of these drugs 
we believe that we will be able to reduce the development time and risks associated with our product candidates  compared to the development of new chemical entities 
our clinical stage product candidates are az staccato loxapine 
we are developing az for the treatment of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bi polar disorder 
in march  we announced positive initial results from a multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase a clinical trial in patients in an in patient clinical setting 
the mg dose of az met the primary endpoint of the clinical trial  which was a statistically significant reduction in the measure of agitation from baseline to the hour post dose time point  as compared to placebo 
the mg dose of az also exhibited a rapid onset of effect  with a statistically significant improvement in the panss positive and negative symptom scale excited component pec scores at minutes post dose  as compared to placebo 
the effectiveness of the 
table of contents mg dose was sustained throughout the hour study period  as compared to placebo 
the mg dose failed to achieve statistical significance 
in february we initiated a phase clinical trial that is designed to enroll approximately schizophrenic patients with acute agitation at us clinical centers 
the trial is an in clinic  multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study and will test az at two dose levels  and mg 
patients may receive up to doses of study drug in a hour period  depending on their clinical status 
the primary endpoint for the study is the change from baseline in the pec score  measured at hours after the first dose 
various assessments of a patient s agitation state will be conducted at serial time points using standard agitation scales over the first hour post dose time period  with follow up assessments at the end of the hour study period 
side effects will be recorded throughout the hour period 
a second phase clinical trial is projected to begin in the third quarter of the design of the second study will be similar to the first trial  except that the patient population will be patients with bipolar disease 
az has been licensed to symphony allegro  inc  or symphony allegro  and we have the right to repurchase all rights to this product candidate 
az staccato prochlorperazine 
we are developing az to treat patients suffering from acute migraine headaches 
in march  we announced positive initial results from an outpatient  multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase b clinical trial of az in migraine patients 
all three doses of az  and mg met the primary endpoint of statistically significant pain relief hours post dose using the ihs international headache society point headache pain rating scale  compared to placebo 
in the two highest doses studied  az also showed a statistically significant difference in achieving a pain free response at two hours  as compared with placebo 
az demonstrated rapid onset of pain relief  with statistically significant pain response in minutes for the mg dose and statistically significant pain responses for all three doses at minutes 
az also showed a sustained pain free response  where a patient has a pain score of  or no headache  with statistically significant elimination of pain at hours post dose at the two highest studied doses 
survival analysis for nausea  photophobia and phonophobia over the hour period post dose showed a statistically significant difference  compared to placebo 
in december  we completed enrollment of a thorough qt clinical trial  in which two doses of az and mg were compared to active control and to placebo 
the purpose of a thorough qt study is to determine a drugs effect on cardiac rhythms 
with subjects per treatment condition  we found that the active control  moxyfloxacin  produced a positive qt qtc signal that verified the sensitivity of the clinical study 
based on a preliminary analysis of the data from the study  neither of the doses of az produced a qt qtc prolongation that would suggest an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia 
az staccato loxapine 
we are developing az to treat patients suffering from acute migraine headaches 
az is a lower dose version of az in march  we announced initial results of an in clinic  multi center randomized  double blind  single administration  placebo controlled phase a proof of concept clinical trial in migraine patients with or without aura 
three doses of az  and mg were evaluated against placebo in the clinical trial 
using the ihs point rating scale  the primary efficacy endpoint was pain relief response at hours post administration 
az met the primary efficacy endpoint of the clinical trial for the two highest doses of the drug compared to placebo 
statistically significant improvements in pain response were observed in of patients at the mg dose p  of patients at the mg dose p and of patients at the mg dose p  compared to of patients receiving placebo 
using survival analysis for pain relief response  all three dose groups were statistically superior p 
to placebo during the hour post treatment time period that the patients remained in the clinic 
az has been licensed to symphony allegro  and we have the right to repurchase all rights to this product candidate 
az staccato alprazolam 
we are developing az for the acute treatment of panic attacks associated with panic disorder 
in april  we initiated an in clinic  single center  double blind  placebo controlled  phase a proof of concept clinical trial in patients with panic disorder 
as a result of observing greater than expected levels of sedation in the first two patients enrolled in the trial  we reduced the dose of az  modified the az device  added an open label portion to the clinical protocol  manufactured and released new clinical trial materials for the trial  and added two additional study sites to the study group 

table of contents in april  we re initiated dosing in the patient clinical trial with a lower dose of az we have completed the open label  lead in segment of the clinical trial  identifying the mg az dose as an acceptable dose in terms of its safety and efficacy profile  and have initiated the randomized  double blind  placebo controlled segment of the clinical trial 
we expect to complete enrollment of this trial in the second quarter of az has been licensed to symphony allegro  and we have the right to repurchase all rights to this product candidate 
az staccato fentanyl 
we are jointly developing az with endo pharmaceuticals inc  or endo  for the treatment of breakthrough pain in cancer and non cancer patients 
endo is responsible for regulatory  pre clinical and clinical development  and for commercializing the product in north america 
we are responsible for the development of the staccato electric multiple dose device and we have the exclusive right to manufacture the product for clinical development and commercial supply 
az staccato zaleplon 
we are developing az for the treatment of insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep  including patients who awake in the middle of the night and have difficulty falling back asleep 
we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  in december in february  we initiated a phase clinical trial that enrolled healthy volunteers at a single site 
the purpose of this trial is to assess the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of a single dose of az using a double blind  randomized trial design  four doses of az ranging from to mg are being compared to placebo 
we expect to report initial results of this trial in the second quarter of we were incorporated december  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  capital lease and equipment financings and government grants 
we have generated million in revenue from inception through december   substantially all of which was earned through united states small business innovation research grants 
we did not have any revenues in  and we do not expect any material product revenue until at least from inception through  we focused on the development of our technology  the selection and preclinical testing of product candidates and the manufacture of clinical trial supplies 
in  we expanded our activities to include the clinical development of our product candidates 
the continued development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including expenses for preclinical studies  clinical trials  research and development  manufacturing development and seeking regulatory approvals 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials  and we expect these expenditures to increase in future years as we continue development of our product candidates 
in  we intend to conduct several clinical trials  including our on going phase clinical trial for az  and an additional phase clinical trial for az with our partner endo  we intend to continue device development and manufacturing of az these clinical trials and development efforts will result in higher expenditures than in previous years 
if these product candidates continue to progress  expenses for future clinical trials will be significantly higher than those incurred to date 
in  we completed a current good manufacturing practice pilot manufacturing facility in mountain view  california and completed the move of our operations to the new facility in the first quarter of we intend the pilot manufacturing facility to be capable of manufacturing materials for toxicology studies and clinical trial materials for future clinical trials 
facility lease payments will decrease in the second and third quarters of as the leases on our palo alto  california facilities expire 
on december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements providing for the financing of additional clinical and nonclinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az  staccato loxapine 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony capital llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of symphony holdings llc  and its investors have invested million to form symphony allegro to fund additional clinical and nonclinical development of staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we have exclusively licensed to symphony allegro certain intellectual property rights related to staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we have retained manufacturing rights to these two product candidates 
we continue to be primarily responsible for the development of these two product candidates in accordance with a development plan and related development budgets  and we have incurred and may continue to incur expenses that are not funded by symphony allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  we have received an exclusive purchase option that gives us the right  but not the obligation  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the equity of symphony allegro  and reacquire the intellectual property rights that we 
table of contents licensed to symphony allegro 
this purchase option is exercisable at predetermined prices between december  and december  the purchase option exercise price may be paid for in cash or in a combination of cash and our common stock  in our sole discretion  provided that the common stock portion may not exceed of the purchase option exercise price or of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the purchase option closing date 
if we pay a portion of the purchase option exercise price in shares of our common stock  then we will be required to register such shares for resale under a resale registration statement pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement 
if we do not exercise our purchase option by december   then symphony allegro will retain its exclusive license to develop and commercialize staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine for all indications  and we will manufacture and sell staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine to symphony allegro or its sublicensee for those purposes 
on december   we entered into a license  development and supply agreement  or the license agreement  with endo for az staccato fentanyl and the fentanyl class of molecules for north america 
under the terms of the license agreement  endo paid us an upfront fee of million  and will pay potential additional milestone payments of up to million upon achievement of predetermined regulatory and clinical milestones 
endo will also pay undisclosed royalties to us on net sales of the product  from which we will pay for the cost of goods for the manufacture of the commercial version of the product 
we have primary responsibility for the development and costs of the staccato electronic multiple dose device and the exclusive right to manufacture the product for clinical development and commercial supply 
endo has responsibility for future pre clinical  clinical and regulatory development  and  if az is approved for marketing  for commercializing the product in north america 
each party will be responsible for all internal costs and expenses incurred related to the respective area of responsibility 
generally speaking  each party will also be responsible for external development costs incurred related to the respective area of responsibility  but we agreed to pay certain external development costs incurred by endo in excess of an agreed upon threshold  with a maximum expense to us of million 
we and endo have established a joint steering committee and a joint development committee to oversee the development of az we have the right  but not the obligation to participate on each of the committees 
we retain all rights outside of north america 
endo has the right to terminate the license agreement on days written notice 
upon such termination  all rights to the product  including regulatory filings  data and clinical and non clinical data for use with the product will revert to us 
we will recognize expense related to the agreement when incurred 
as our activities have expanded  we have consistently increased the number of our employees 
we expect that we will add a significant number of employees during the remainder of to support our expanded operations 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our deficit accumulated during development stage was million and total stockholders equity was million 
we recognized net losses of million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
we expect our net losses to increase as we continue our existing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials  expand our research and development efforts  continue our manufacturing development  begin commercialization development  and add infrastructure to support these expanded operations 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the development of our product candidates to be crucial to our long term success 
if we do not complete development of our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval to market one or more of these product candidates  we may be forced to cease operations 
the probability of success for each product candidate may be impacted by numerous factors  including preclinical data  clinical data  competition  device development  manufacturing capability  regulatory approval and commercial viability 
our strategy includes entering into strategic partnerships with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates  such as our symphony allegro and endo relationships 
endo has control over future preclinical and clinical development of az if in the future we enter into additional partnerships  third parties could have control over preclinical development or clinical trials for some of our product candidates 
accordingly  the progress of such product candidate would not be under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to any future partnerships or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 

table of contents as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments  and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing our product candidates  we anticipate that we and our partners  will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we anticipate developing additional product candidates  which will also increase our research and development expenses in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
we anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  along with interest earned thereon  funding available under our equipment financing arrangements  expected payments from symphony allegro  expected proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through the middle of critical accounting estimates and judgments our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant estimates and judgments in preparation of our financial statements 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals we estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to contract research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study and clinical trial costs based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research institutions and organizations 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial costs 
we make good faith estimates which we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risk and may change depending upon a 
table of contents number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
with the start of our phase clinical trial in the first quarter of and future phase clinical trials  the process of estimating clinical trial costs will become more difficult as the trials will involve larger numbers of patients and clinical sites 
stock based compensation employee equity incentive awards issued on or subsequent to january  on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
as required  we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method 
under this transition method  beginning january   compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  related to i employees  based on the intrinsic value in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and ii non employees based on the options fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit 
our current estimate assumes no dividends will be paid prior to the vesting of the restricted stock unit 
through  we estimated the expected term of options using the simplified method  as illustrated in sab beginning in  we will estimate the expected term of our options based on historical option activity 
as we have been operating as a public company for a period of time that is significantly shorter than our estimated expected option term  we are unable to use actual price volatility data 
therefore  we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on volatility of similar entities 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expenses in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
employee equity incentive awards issued prior to january  prior to january   we used the intrinsic value recognition method for equity incentive awards issued to employees in accordance with apb during the year ended december   we granted options to employees 
table of contents to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations from an unrelated valuation specialist during this period 
instead  we relied on our board of directors  the members of which have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one of whom are non employee directors  to determine a reasonable estimate of the then current value of our common stock 
given the absence of an active market for our common stock during  our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements in connection with our initial public offering in march  we reassessed the estimated fair value of our common stock in light of the expected completion of the offering 
in reassessing the fair value of our common stock during for purposes of computing the stock based compensation expense  we reassessed the fair value of the common stock assuming the successful completion of our initial public offering and then determined the reassessed fair value at previous points in time 
in determining the reassessed fair value of our common stock during  we established as the reassessed fair value at december  of the midpoint of the estimated price range of the initial public offering and applied it over the prior month period using a straight line basis 
we also considered other material factors in reassessing fair value for financial reporting purposes as of the respective option grant dates  including the completion of our phase clinical trial of az in september  the completion of our phase clinical trial of az in november  the results of our phase a clinical trial of az  valuations of existing comparable publicly traded companies  the state of the public offering market for development stage life sciences companies and our decision to pursue an initial public offering 
we believe this approach was consistent with valuation methodologies applied by other life science companies pursuing an initial public offering 
the reassessed fair value used to compute the stock based compensation expense may not be reflective of the fair market value that would result from the application of other valuation methods  including accepted valuation methods for tax purposes 
based upon the reassessment discussed above  we determined that the reassessed fair value of the options to purchase  shares of common stock ranged from to per share during the year ended december  we took into account the factors identified above in determining the reassessed fair value of the common stock as of each grant date 
share based compensation resulting from this reassessment equals the difference between the reassessed fair value per share of our common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price per share and is being amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
as a result of the reassessed fair value of options granted  we recorded deferred stock based compensation relative to these options of approximately million during the year ended december   which is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options on a straight line basis 
during the years ended december   and  we amortized   and  respectively  of deferred stock based compensation 
at december  we have  of deferred stock compensation to be amortized in future periods as follows  in and  in in addition  we had three officer stock option grants that were subject to variable accounting treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with the variable options  we measured additional compensation each period based on the incremental difference between the reassessed fair value of the shares and the exercise price of the stock options and recorded compensation expense on a graded vesting basis in accordance with fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
as a result of the reassessed fair value  we recorded  of stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  as a result of changes in our stock price  we recorded a  reduction in compensation expense during the first quarter of as the exercise price was fixed in march  the contingency was resolved and variable accounting for these options ceased 
in december  we extinguished the housing loans that were made to the three officers having a total principal value of million and we agreed to pay million of taxes related to the extinguishment on the officers behalf 
we recognized compensation expense of million in the quarter ended december  as a result of the extinguishments of the officers notes and related taxes 
in connection with the loan extinguishment agreements  we settled the loan extinguishment by reducing the aggregate intrinsic value of their stock options as described below 
as a result  variable stock based compensation expense was reduced by an amount equal to the million loan extinguishment and related taxes in the quarter ended december  
table of contents in settlement for the extinguishment of the officer notes receivable  we increased the exercise price of certain options to purchase common stock held by these officers such that the aggregate intrinsic value of their stock option awards was reduced by an amount equal to the amounts of the loans extinguished and related taxes paid on their behalf 
we settled this transaction based on our initial public offering price of per share 
symphony allegro  inc on december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  or symphony capital  symphony allegro holdings llc  or holdings  and holdings wholly owned subsidiary symphony allegro  inc  or allegro  to fund the clinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az  staccato loxapine  or the programs 
symphony capital and other investors  together referred to as symphony  invested million in holdings  which then invested the million in allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  allegro agreed to invest up to the full million to fund the clinical development of the programs  and we licensed to allegro certain intellectual property rights related to these programs 
we have retained manufacturing rights to these two product candidates 
pursuant to the agreements  we continue to be primarily responsible for all preclinical  clinical and device development efforts as well as maintenance of the intellectual property portfolio for the programs 
we and allegro have established a development committee to oversee the programs 
we participate in the development committee and have the right to appoint one of the five board of director seats of allegro 
we have incurred and may continue to incur expenses related to the programs that are not funded by allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  we have received an exclusive purchase option  or the purchase option  that gives us the right  but not the obligation  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the equity of allegro  and reacquire the intellectual property rights that we licensed to allegro 
the purchase option is exercisable at predetermined prices that increase over time and range from million starting december  to million through november  the purchase option exercise price may be paid for in cash or in a combination of cash and our common stock  in our sole discretion  provided that the common stock portion may not exceed of the purchase option exercise price or of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the purchase option closing date 
if we pay a portion of the purchase option exercise price in shares of our common stock  then we will be required to register such shares for resale under a resale registration statement pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement 
if we do not exercise the purchase option by december   then allegro will retain its exclusive license to develop and commercialize staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine for all indications  and  if they are ultimately commercialized  we will manufacture and sell staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine to allegro or its sublicensee for those purposes 
in consideration for the purchase option  we issued to holdings a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share and paid million for structuring fees and related expenses to symphony capital 
under fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  a variable interest entity vie is an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary  which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the vie s outcomes 
the application of fin r to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment 
we have consolidated the financial position and results of operations of allegro in accordance with fin r 
we believe allegro is by design a vie because we have a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised 
the fixed nature of the purchase option price limits symphony s returns  as the investor in allegro 
fin r deems parties to be de facto agents if they cannot sell  transfer  or encumber their interests without the prior approval of an enterprise 
symphony is considered to be a de facto agent of the company pursuant to this provision  and because we and symphony  as a related party group  absorb a majority of allegro s variability  we evaluated whether  pursuant to fin r s requirements  we are most closely associated with allegro 
we concluded that we are most closely associated with allegro and should consolidate allegro because we originally developed the technology that was assigned to allegro  we will continue to oversee and monitor the development program  our employees will continue to perform substantially all of the development work  
table of contents we significantly influenced the design of the responsibilities and corporate structure of allegro  allegro s operations are substantially similar to our activities  and through the purchase option  we have the ability to meaningfully participate in the benefits of a successful development effort 
symphony will be required to absorb the development risk for its equity investment in allegro 
pursuant to fin r s requirements  symphony s equity investment in allegro is classified as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
the noncontrolling interest held by symphony has been reduced by the million fair value of the warrant it received in consideration for the purchase option and million of fees we immediately paid to symphony upon the transaction s closing because the total consideration provided by us to symphony effectively reduces symphony s at risk equity investment in allegro 
while we perform the research and development on behalf of allegro  our development risk is limited to the consideration we provided to symphony the warrant and fees 
losses incurred by allegro are charged to the noncontrolling interest until that balance has been reduced to zero  at which point our net loss will be increased for the research and development expenses incurred subsequent to that date 
net losses incurred by allegro and charged to the noncontrolling interest were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   the noncontrolling interest balance was million 
we currently expect the noncontrolling interest to be exhausted by the end of as of december   the investments held by allegro were million  which we expect to spend through the term of the collaboration in if we do not exercise the purchase option  we would expect to recognize losses incurred after the noncontrolling interest in allegro is reduced to zero 
furthermore  if the purchase option expires unexercised  we would then be required to deconsolidate allegro 
that potential deconsolidation would not be expected to impact our earnings because the carrying value of the net assets of allegro would be expected to be zero 
in contrast  if we exercise the purchase option  we will retain control of allegro 
as such  we would expect to record the exercise of the purchase option as a return to the noncontrolling interest 
we do not expect to recognize an asset for the purchase option payment to be made to symphony 
instead  the payment is expected to be accounted for as a capital transaction that is  a return to the noncontrolling interest that would not affect our net income or loss 
however  because the exercise of the purchase option will be accounted for as a capital transaction  it will be treated as a deemed dividend for purposes of reporting earnings per share  increasing loss per share or decreasing income per share  as the case may be  in the period we exercise the purchase option 
if the programs are successful and the resources are available  we expect to exercise the purchase option 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
we had no revenues in and had million of revenues in in  we recognized approximately million of government grant revenue and  of revenue from drug compound feasibility screening 
we do not expect additional grant revenue in  as we place greater emphasis on strategic partnerships and allocate fewer resources to obtaining grants 
we do not expect to generate significant  if any  revenues from drug compound feasibility screening in future periods 

table of contents operating expenses share based compensation expenses had varying degrees of impact on our comparative operating expenses for the years ended december   and our operating expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands year ended december  non share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative total non share based compensation expenses share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative total share based compensation expenses total operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing development efforts

we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
the key assumptions underlying this estimate include expenditures related to continued preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidates during this period within budgeted levels  the timing and amount of payments from symphony allegro  no unexpected costs related to the development of our manufacturing capability  and the hiring of a number of new employees at salary levels consistent with our estimates to support our continued growth during this period 
our forecast of the period of time that our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any distribution  strategic partnerships or licensing agreements that we may establish  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or
