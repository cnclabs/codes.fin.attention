intersegment services aesc is a service company for ae that employs substantially all of the allegheny personnel who provide services to ae  ae supply  agc  the distribution companies  allegheny ventures  trail company  path  llc and their respective subsidiaries 
these companies reimburse aesc at cost for services provided to them by aesc s employees 
aesc had  employees as of december  key indicators and performance factors the delivery and services segment allegheny monitors the financial and operating performance of its delivery and services segment using a number of indicators and performance statistics  including the following revenue per mwh sold 
this measure is calculated by dividing total revenues from retail sales of electricity by total mwhs sold to retail customers 
revenue per mwh sold in  and was as follows revenue per mwh sold operations and maintenance costs o m 
management closely monitors and manages o m in absolute terms  as well as in relation to total mwhs sold 
o m per mwh sold in  and was as follows o m per mwh sold capital expenditures 
management prioritizes and manages capital expenditures to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements within available cash flow constraints 
see business capital expenditures above 
the following table provides retail electricity sales information related to the delivery and services segment 
normal change change retail electricity sales million kwhs n a    hdd a cdd a a heating degree days hdd and cooling degree days cdd 
the operations of the distribution companies are weather sensitive 
weather conditions directly influence the volume of electricity delivered by the distribution companies  representing one of several factors that impact the volume of electricity delivered 
accordingly  deviations in weather from normal levels can affect allegheny s financial performance 
hdd and cdd are most likely to impact the usage of allegheny s residential and commercial customers 
industrial customers are less weather sensitive 
degree day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day s average temperature 
hdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below fahrenheit  and cdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above fahrenheit 
each degree of temperature above fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree day 
the generation and marketing segment allegheny monitors the financial and operating performance of its generation and marketing segment using a number of indicators and performance statistics  including the following kwhs generated 
this is a measure of the total physical quantity of electricity generated and is monitored at the individual generating unit level  as well as by various unit groupings 
equivalent availability factor eaf 
the eaf measures the percentage of time that a generation unit is available to generate electricity if called upon in the marketplace 
a unit s availability is commonly less than  primarily as a result of unplanned outages or scheduled outages for planned maintenance 
allegheny monitors the eaf by individual unit  as well as by various unit groupings 
one such grouping is all supercritical units 
a supercritical unit utilizes steam pressure in excess of  pounds per square inch  which enables these units to be larger and more efficient than other generation units 
fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry and pleasants are supercritical generation facilities that have supercritical units 
these units generally operate at high capacity for extended periods of time 
station operations and maintenance costs station o m 
station o m includes base  operations and special maintenance costs 
base and operations costs consist of normal recurring expenses related to the on going operation of the generation facility 
special maintenance costs include costs associated with outage related maintenance and projects that relate to all of the generation facilities

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the areas described in this section require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
further discussion of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition allegheny follows the accrual method of accounting for revenues and recognizes revenue for electricity that has been delivered to customers but not yet billed through the end of its accounting period 
unbilled revenues are primarily associated with the distribution companies 
energy sales to individual customers are based on their meter readings  which are performed periodically on a systematic basis 
at the end of each month  the amount of energy delivered to each customer after the last meter reading is estimated  and the distribution companies recognize unbilled revenues related to these estimated amounts 
a provision for uncollectible amounts is recorded as a component of operations and maintenance expense 
the unbilled revenue estimates are based on daily generation  purchases of electricity  estimated customer usage by customer type  weather effects  electric line losses and the most recent consumer rates 
regulatory accounting the distribution companies  trail company and path  llc are subject to regulations that set the rates that they are permitted to charge customers 
these rates are based on costs that the applicable regulatory agencies determine that the distribution companies  trail company and path  llc are permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future  but not current  recovery through rates of costs that would otherwise be charged to expense by an unregulated company 
regulators may also require that amounts be refunded to customers for various reasons 
therefore  this ratemaking process often results in the recording of regulatory assets based on estimated future cash inflows and the recording of regulatory liabilities based on estimated future cash outflows 
allegheny regularly reviews its regulatory assets and liabilities and the estimates and assumptions from which they were calculated to assess the ultimate recoverability of the assets and anticipated customer refunds within approved regulatory guidelines 
see note  basis of presentation and note  rates and regulation  for additional information 
expanded net energy cost enec on may   the west virginia psc issued a rate order the west virginia rate order effective may  that re established an annual enec method of recovering net power supply costs  including fuel costs  purchased power costs and other related expenses  net of related revenue 
under the enec  actual costs and revenues are being tracked for under and or over recoveries  and revised enec rate filings with the west virginia psc will be made on an annual basis 
any under and or over recovery of costs  net of related revenues  is being deferred  for subsequent recovery or refund  as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability  with the corresponding impact on the consolidated statements of income reflected within deferred energy costs  net 
by order dated january   the west virginia psc approved a modification to the enec directing interest earnings on the fort martin scrubber project escrow fund to be applied to the enec 
excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill recorded goodwill of million at december  and december  arose in connection with the acquisition of a former energy trading business and was assigned to the generation and marketing segment 
there were no changes in recorded goodwill during and allegheny tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the annual impairment test uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine the fair value of the generation and marketing segment and indicated no impairment of goodwill in and allegheny s fleet of generation facilities  comprised primarily of low cost coal fired steam generation facilities  has a fair value well in excess of the carrying value of those assets 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of these facilities would therefore not result in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
depreciation depreciation expense is determined generally on a straight line group method over the estimated service lives of depreciable assets for unregulated operations 
for regulated utility operations  depreciation expense is determined using a straight line group method in accordance with currently enacted regulatory rates 
under the straight line group method  plant components are categorized as retirement units or minor items of property 
as retirement units are replaced  the cost of the replacement is capitalized and the original component is retired 
replacements of minor items of property are expensed as maintenance 
allegheny completed a review of the estimated remaining service lives and depreciation practices relating to its unregulated generation facilities during the first quarter of as a result of this review  effective january   allegheny prospectively extended the depreciable lives of its unregulated coal fired generation facilities for periods ranging from to years to match the estimated remaining economic lives of these generation facilities 
the extension of estimated lives reflected a number of factors  including the physical condition of the facilities  current maintenance practices and planned investments in the facilities 
allegheny also updated its property unit catalog and retirement unit definitions 
these changes were considered in estimating the revised depreciation rates 
see note  review of estimated remaining service lives and depreciation practices  for additional information 
long lived assets allegheny s consolidated balance sheets include significant long lived assets that are not subject to recovery under sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  sfas 
as a result  allegheny must generate future cash flows from these assets in a non regulated environment to ensure that the carrying values of these assets are not impaired 
allegheny assesses the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
derivative contracts derivative contracts are recorded in allegheny s consolidated balance sheets at fair value  with changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts included in revenues or expenses on the consolidated statements of income  unless the derivative falls within the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas or is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes 
the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception requires  among other things  physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business 
contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are accounted for under accrual accounting and  therefore  are not recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
for certain transactions that are designed to hedge the cash flows of a forecasted transaction  the effective portion of the hedge is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction is completed or settled 
changes in any ineffective portion of the hedge are recognized in earnings 
fair values for exchange traded instruments  principally futures and certain options  are based on actively quoted market prices 
fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect management s best estimate based on various factors 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted prices  such as physical contracts  over the counter options and swaps  management uses available market data and pricing models to estimate fair values 
estimating fair values of instruments that do not have quoted market prices requires management s judgment in determining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from  or paid to  a third party in settlement of the instruments 
these amounts could be materially different from amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction 
see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  for additional information regarding allegheny s accounting for derivative instruments under sfas income taxes allegheny is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various state jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining the provisions for income taxes 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which proscribes an approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
see note  income taxes  for additional information 
stock based compensation allegheny adopted the recognition and measurement principles of sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation  sfas r as of january  sfas r requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation cost over the service period for the awards expected to vest 
the determination of grant date fair value requires the use of judgment based on historical information as well as future expectations 
in addition  the estimates of stock based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and actual results or updated estimates may differ from current estimates 
see note  stock based compensation  for additional information 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions there are a number of significant estimates and assumptions involved in determining allegheny s pension and other postretirement benefit opeb obligations and costs each period  such as employee demographics  discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  estimated rates of future compensation increases  medical inflation and the fair value of assets funded for the plan 
changes made to provisions for pension or other postretirement benefit plans may also affect current and future pension and opeb costs 
allegheny believes that its assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections  and its projections are reviewed annually with an outside actuarial firm 
see note  pension benefits and postretirement benefits other than pensions  for additional information concerning these assumptions 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  allegheny uses a modeling process that involves selecting a portfolio of high quality bonds aa or better  the interest and principal payments on which match the timing and amount of allegheny s expected future benefit payments 
allegheny considers the results of this modeling process  as well as overall rates of return on high quality corporate bonds and changes in such rates over time  in determining its assumed discount rate 
allegheny s general approach for determining the overall expected long term rate of return on assets considers historical and expected future asset returns  the current and future targeted asset mix of the plan assets  historical and future expected real rates of return for equities and fixed income securities and historical and expected inflation statistics 
the following table shows the effect that a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate and the expected rate of return  net of administrative expenses  on plan assets for would have on allegheny s pension and opeb obligations and costs in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease change in the discount rate pension and opeb obligation net periodic pension and opeb cost change in expected rate of return on plan assets net periodic pension and opeb cost contingencies allegheny regularly reviews and assesses the likelihood of losses relating to environmental  legal and other contingencies and accrues a liability for matters for which it believes that a loss is probable if the probable loss can be estimated

operating revenues operating revenues increased million for compared to  primarily due to higher generation rates charged to pennsylvania customers  an increase in the weighted average round the clock price for power in allegheny s region of pjm  the aps zone  from per mwh for to per mwh for and increased net pjm capacity market revenues  increased revenues related to the collection of the environmental control surcharge from the west virginia retail customers of monongahela and potomac edison  which began in april and increased transmission and distribution revenues due to increases in hdd and cdd  increased customer load and the expiration of a maryland customer choice credit  partially offset by a decrease in total mwhs generated due to a decrease in supercritical plant availability 
operating revenues increased million for compared to  primarily due to the expiration of a plr contract with one large industrial customer in maryland in december  which resulted in greater net sales into pjm at market prices  higher generation rates charged to pennsylvania customers  monongahela s agreement to provide power to columbus southern from january  through may  under a fixed price power supply agreement at a higher rate per mwh  net of lost ohio t d revenues and increased mwhs generated 
these factors contributing to increases in operating revenues were partially offset by a decrease in average market prices  the march assignment of ae supply s rights to generation from the ohio valley electric corporation ovec in connection with the december  sale of a portion of ae s equity interest in ovec  the expiration of third party transmission capacity contracts and decreased revenues associated with the completion of a construction services project during the second quarter of operating income operating income increased million for compared to  due to the million increase in operating revenues discussed above  partially offset by an million increase in fuel expense 
fuel expense increased primarily due to higher coal  natural gas and emission allowance costs 
the higher coal costs were primarily due to an increase in the average price of coal 
the higher natural gas costs resulted from an increase in the amount of natural gas burned as a result of an increase in the dispatch of allegheny s gas fired generation facilities 
operating income increased million in compared to  due to the million increase in operating revenues discussed above and a million decrease in operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased as a result of a million decrease in purchased power and transmission expense  a million loss recorded during in connection with the sale of monongahela s ohio t d assets  a million decrease in operations and maintenance expense and a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by an million increase in fuel expense 
purchased power and transmission decreased due to the march assignment of ae supply s rights to generation from ovec  a reduction in contracts that were designated as normal purchase and normal sale  a refund received on certain transmission charges and a reduction in power purchases due to the sale of monongahela s ohio t d assets 
operations and maintenance expense decreased due to litigation settlements  a reduction in accrued site remediation reserves associated with a previously terminated generation project  reductions in costs associated with a completed construction services project and decreased salaries and wages expense related to a decrease in the number of information technology employees as a result of the outsourcing of this function 
these decreases were partially offset by increased outside services expense due to costs associated with the implementation of allegheny s information technology initiatives 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to the extension of the depreciable lives of allegheny s unregulated coal fired generation facilities  partially offset by increased depreciation resulting from net property  plant and equipment additions 
fuel expense increased primarily due to an increase in coal expense resulting from an increase in the average price of coal and an increase in the amount of coal consumed  partially offset by a decrease in natural gas expense resulting from a decrease in the average price of natural gas and a decrease in the amount of natural gas consumed 
income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest increased million for compared to  primarily due to the million increase in operating income discussed above and an million decrease in interest expense and preferred dividends  primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest resulting from the settlement of allegheny s litigation with merrill lynch and co  inc merrill lynch  as well as lower average debt outstanding and increased capitalization of interest  partially offset by increased interest expense associated with the april issuance of environmental control bonds 
see note  subsequent event  for additional information regarding the settlement of allegheny s litigation with merrill lynch 
income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest increased million for compared to  primarily due to the million increase in operating income discussed above and a million decrease in interest expense and preferred dividends  primarily due to the premium and associated costs recorded during to redeem ae supply s outstanding and senior notes  costs related to the april tender offer by ae and allegheny capital trust i capital trust for capital trust s outstanding trust preferred securities  million of interest recorded during the first quarter of related to a court decision in the litigation involving merrill lynch and lower average debt outstanding

generation revenues increased primarily due to a million increase resulting from higher generation rates charged to pennsylvania customers  a million increase resulting from higher market rates for commercial and industrial customers in maryland  a million increase from the west virginia rate order  which approved an increase in generation rates charged to customers  and a million increase due to increased customer load from increases in hdd and cdd 
t d revenues increased primarily due to a million increase from increased customer load and an million increase due to the expiration of a maryland customer choice credit  partially offset by a million decrease as a result of the west virginia rate order 
retail electric revenues decreased million for compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in generation revenues due to the following items a million decrease due to the expiration of a contract with one large industrial customer in maryland in december  a million decrease due to milder weather and lower industrial usage  partially offset by increased load growth from new customers and customer usage  a million decrease due to certain potomac edison customers choosing alternate electricity generation providers and a million decrease due to the sale of monongahela s ohio service territory on december   partially offset by a million increase in revenues as a result of the transition to market based generation rates for maryland commercial and industrial customers  as well as an increase in monongahela s effective generation rates and a million increase in revenues as a result of higher generation rates charged to pennsylvania customers  offset by a lower surcharge rate for intangible transition charge revenues  and a million decrease in t d revenues  primarily as a result of an million decrease in revenue from the expiration of a contract with one large industrial customer in maryland in december  a million decrease associated with the sale of monongahela s ohio service territory and a million decrease due to milder weather and lower industrial usage  partially offset by increased load growth from new customers and customer usage 
distribution revenues from customers who chose alternate generation suppliers are reflected in retail electric revenues regardless of the customers election to receive service from allegheny or an alternate generation supplier 
however  transmission revenues attributable to retail customers served by alternate generation suppliers are no longer reflected in retail revenues  but  instead  are reflected in transmission and bulk power revenues 
the return of customers to default generation service results in an increase in total revenues due to the addition of a generation charge that allegheny did not collect while those customers were using alternate generation suppliers 
transmission services and bulk power revenues decreased by million for compared to  primarily due to the may expiration of a fixed price power supply agreement to serve monongahela s former ohio service territory 
transmission services and bulk power revenues increased by million for compared to  primarily due to a million increase in bulk power revenues related to monongahela s fixed price power supply agreement with columbus southern to serve monongahela s former ohio service territory as of january  partially offset by a million decrease in transmission revenues related to the expiration of third party transmission capacity contracts and a million decrease in bulk power revenues resulting from decreased power sales from the aes warrior run purpa generation facility due to a scheduled outage at that facility during the first quarter of and a contractual reduction in the capacity rate at the facility 
other affiliated and nonaffiliated energy services revenues increased million for compared to  primarily due to the deferral of revenue on certain fiber optic agreements during the first quarter of and the impact of regulatory activities related to certain transmission contracts 
other affiliated and nonaffiliated energy services revenues decreased million for compared to  primarily due to decreased revenues associated with a construction services project that was completed during the second quarter of operating expenses purchased power and transmission purchased power and transmission represents the distribution companies power purchases from other companies primarily ae supply and monongahela  as well as purchases from qualifying facilities under purpa 
purchased power and transmission consists of the following items in millions other purchased power and transmission from purpa generation total purchased power and transmission west penn and potomac edison currently have power purchase agreements with ae supply  under which ae supply provides west penn and potomac edison with the majority of the power necessary to meet their plr obligations 
these agreements have both fixed price and market based pricing components 
in addition  through december   potomac edison had a power purchase agreement with ae supply under which ae supply provided potomac edison with the power necessary to meet its west virginia load obligation at a fixed rate 
in connection with the asset swap  monongahela assumed the obligation to supply power to serve potomac edison s west virginia load 
thus  effective january   potomac edison purchases the power necessary to service its west virginia customers from monongahela s generation and marketing segment at a prorated share of overall monongahela generation costs and associated revenue 
effective with the institution under the west virginia rate order of the enec method of recovering net power supply costs for allegheny s west virginia service territory  the amount charged to potomac edison reflects the adjustment for over and or under recovery 
see business electric facilities and business regulatory framework affecting allegheny above  note  rates and regulation and note asset swap  for additional information 
through december   to facilitate the economic dispatch of its generation  monongahela sold the power that it generated from its west virginia jurisdictional assets to ae supply at pjm market prices and purchased from ae supply  at pjm market prices  the power necessary to meet its west virginia jurisdictional customer load 
effective january   monongahela sells the power that it generates from its west virginia jurisdictional assets into the pjm market and purchases from the pjm market the power necessary to meet its west virginia jurisdictional customer load and its contractual obligations 
the net revenue from these pjm purchases and sales is reflected in wholesale and other revenues  net within the generation and marketing segment 
other purchased power and transmission increased million for compared to  primarily due to a million increase due to increased purchased power volume  primarily as a result of increases in hdd and cdd  increased customer load and the decrease in purchased power from purpa generation  primarily as a result of a january  transfer of monongahela s purpa contracts from the delivery and services segment to the generation and marketing segment  which caused a corresponding increase in other purchased power and transmission  a million increase due to market based rates in virginia beginning july  see business regulatory framework affecting allegheny above and note  rates and regulation  for additional information regarding market based rates in virginia  a million increase  primarily due to a net increase in the price of purchased power from ae supply for pennsylvania customers  which is passed on to ae supply under the terms of a power supply agreement between west penn and ae supply  a million increase  primarily due to the january  activity between potomac edison and monongahela discussed above monongahela s revenues relating to this agreement are included in the generation and marketing segment and a million increase due to the west virginia rate order  which approved an increase in generation rates charged to customers resulting in greater costs to the delivery and services segment and greater revenues to the generation and marketing segment  partially offset by a million decrease due to the expiration of a contract to supply power for monongahela s former ohio electric service territory through may purchased power from purpa generation decreased million for compared to  primarily as a result of a january  transfer of monongahela s purpa contracts from the delivery and services segment to the generation and marketing segment  partially offset by increased power purchased from the aes warrior run purpa generation facility  primarily due to a scheduled outage at that facility during that did not recur during other purchased power and transmission decreased million for compared to  primarily due to a million decrease due to milder weather and lower industrial usage  partially offset by increased load growth from new customers and customer usage  a million decrease related to the expiration of a contract with one large industrial customer in maryland in december  a million decrease as a result of commercial and industrial customers electing third party generation providers in maryland and a million decrease related to the sale of monongahela s ohio service territory on december   partially offset by a million increase  primarily due to a net increase in the price of purchased power from ae supply for pennsylvania customers  effective january   as a result of a rate increase arising from a settlement approved by the pennsylvania puc and a million increase as a result of the transition to market based generation rates for maryland commercial and industrial customers 
purchased power from purpa generation decreased million for compared to  primarily due to decreased power purchased from the aes warrior run purpa generation facility due to a scheduled outage at that facility during and a decrease in the contractual capacity rate at that facility 
loss on sale of ohio t d assets during  the delivery and services segment recorded a loss of million in connection with the sale of monongahela s electric t d assets in ohio 
the loss was based on the estimated value  at december   of monongahela s power sales agreement with columbus southern to provide power at below market prices from january  through may   partially offset by approximately million  representing the purchase price less the net book value of the assets at december  and approximately million in expenses associated with the sale 
deferred energy costs  net deferred energy costs  net represents a component of expense to reconcile the period in which increases or decreases in certain energy costs are incurred to the period in which such costs are recovered in rates 
deferred energy costs relate to the following aes warrior run purpa generation to satisfy certain of its obligations under purpa  potomac edison entered into a long term contract beginning july  to purchase capacity and energy from the aes warrior run purpa generation facility through the beginning of potomac edison is authorized by the maryland psc to recover all contract costs from the aes warrior run purpa generation facility  net of any revenues received from the sale of aes warrior run output into the wholesale energy market  by means of a retail revenue surcharge the aes warrior run surcharge 
any under recovery or over recovery of net costs is being deferred pending subsequent recovery from  or return to  customers through adjustments to the aes warrior run surcharge

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  allegheny continued its focus on managing risk  optimizing the value of its generation facilities and prudently managing and protecting the value associated with its wholesale energy markets transactions portfolio 
allegheny remains exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related commodities 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to variable rate debt and debt that is maturing and is refinanced 
allegheny has a program designed to systematically identify  measure  evaluate and actively manage and report market risks 
allegheny s corporate risk policy was adopted by its board of directors and is monitored by a risk management committee  which is chaired by its chief executive officer or his designee and is composed of senior management 
an independent risk management group within allegheny measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and to ensure that the policy is periodically reviewed 
to manage the financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations in its wholesale transactions portfolio  fuel procurement  power marketing  natural gas supply and risk management activities  allegheny enters into contracts  such as electricity  coal and natural gas purchase and sale commitments  to hedge the risk exposure 
however  allegheny does not hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of reasons 
to the extent allegheny does not hedge against commodity price volatility  its consolidated results of operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the forward price curves and spot commodity prices 
allegheny enters into certain contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
certain of these contracts are recorded at their fair value and are an economic hedge for the generation facilities 
for accounting purposes  the generation facilities are recorded at historical cost less depreciation 
as a result  allegheny s results of operations and financial position can be favorably or unfavorably affected by a change in forward market prices 
of its commodity driven risks  allegheny is primarily exposed to risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets  including generation  coal and other fuel procurement  power marketing and the purchase and sale of electricity 
allegheny s wholesale activities principally consist of bilateral forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
the majority of these contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell electricity at fixed prices in the future 
these forward contracts can require either physical or financial settlement 
at december   ae s outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates was million  compared to million of outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates at december  accordingly  a one percent increase in the variable interest rate under ae s and ae supply s current credit facilities would increase allegheny s projected interest expense in by approximately million for outstanding debt  on an annual basis  based on the amount of outstanding debt as of december  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements below and note  capitalization and short term debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty to a transaction will be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
allegheny evaluates the credit standing of a prospective counterparty based on the prospective counterparty s financial condition 
where deemed necessary  allegheny may impose specified collateral requirements and use standardized agreements that facilitate netting of cash flows 
allegheny monitors the financial conditions of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
allegheny s independent risk management group oversees credit risk 
allegheny engages in various energy trading activities 
the counterparties to these transactions generally include electric and natural gas utilities  independent power producers  energy marketers and commercial and industrial customers 
in the event the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  allegheny may incur a loss to close out a position 
allegheny has a concentration of counterparties in the electric  coal and natural gas utility industries 
this concentration of counterparties may affect allegheny s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  because these counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
as of december   allegheny s derivatives are comprised primarily of interest rate swap agreements with a single counterparty and commodity cash flow hedges that will expire through december allegheny currently is involved in a number of capital intensive projects  including the trail project  the path project and the installation of scrubbers at the fort martin and hatfield s ferry generation facilities 
allegheny has contracted  or expects to contract  with specialized vendors to acquire some of the necessary materials and construction related services in order to complete these projects 
as such  allegheny is exposed to the risk that these contractors may not perform as required under their contracts 
should this occur  allegheny may be forced to find alternate arrangements  which may cause delay and or increased costs 
furthermore  allegheny can provide no assurance that it would be able to make such alternate arrangements on terms acceptable to it or at all 
allegheny also may be subject to credit risk through its participation in pjm  to the extent that pjm socializes counterparty defaults across pjm members 
market risk market risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy related to price and volatility in the market 
allegheny reduces these risks by using its generation assets to back positions on physical transactions 
allegheny monitors market risk exposure and credit risk limits within the guidelines of its corporate energy risk policy 
allegheny evaluates commodity price risk  operational risk and credit risk in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts 
allegheny and ae supply use various methods to measure their exposure to market risk on a daily basis  including a value at risk model var 
var is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data over a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors to set the overall corporate risk tolerance  determine risk targets and monitor positions 
allegheny and ae supply calculate var by using a variance covariance approach  in which the option positions are evaluated by using their delta equivalences 
due to inherent limitations of var  including the use of approximations to value options  subjectivity in the choice of liquidation period and reliance on historical data to calibrate the model  the var calculation may not accurately reflect allegheny s and ae supply s market risk exposure 
as a result  changes in allegheny s and ae supply s market risk sensitive instruments could differ from the calculated var  and these changes could have a material effect on allegheny s and ae supply s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in addition to var  allegheny and ae supply routinely perform stress and scenario analyses to measure extreme losses due to exceptional events 
allegheny and ae supply review the var and stress test results to determine the maximum expected reduction in the fair value of the entire energy markets portfolio 
ae supply calculated var using the full term of all remaining wholesale energy market positions that are accounted for as marked to market 
this calculation is based upon management s best estimates and modeling assumptions  which could materially differ from actual results 
as of december  and  this calculation yielded a var of and  respectively
