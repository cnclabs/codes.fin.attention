business overview we operate infrastructure services that enable and protect billions of interactions every day across the world s voice  video and data networks 
we offer a variety of internet and communications related services  which are marketed through web site sales  direct field sales  channel sales  telesales  and member organizations in our global affiliate network 
our business consists of two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group 
the internet services group consists of the information and security services business and the naming services business 
the information and security services business provides products and services that protect online and network interactions  enabling companies to manage reputational  operational and compliance risks 
the naming services business is the authoritative directory provider of all 
com  
net  
cc  and 
tv domain names 
the communications services group provides communications services  such as connectivity and interoperability services and intelligent database services  commerce services  such as billing and operational support system services  and mobile commerce services  and content services  such as digital content and messaging services 
in late  we announced a change to our business strategy to be more tightly aligned with our core competencies  which is providing highly scaleable  reliable and secure internet infrastructure services to customers around the world 
the strategy calls for divesture of a number of non core businesses in our portfolio  such as communications  billing and commerce  content delivery  messaging and enterprise security services 
by divesting these non core businesses  additional resources should be available to invest in the core businesses that will remain naming services  ssl certificate services  and identity and authentication services 
we face a number of risks associated with our plan to divest ourselves of several non core businesses 
the operations of these businesses will be classified as discontinued operations when all criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  are met 
all of such criteria were not met as of december  as a result of these divestitures in  we would expect revenues  operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations to decrease in absolute dollars and expect a reduction in the number of employees 
effective january   we adopted a functional business structure that realigned the internet services group and the communications services group to deliver products and services on an integrated basis through two main functional units sales and consulting services and products and marketing 
the sales and consulting services group is aligned by vertical industry and combines our multiple sales functions  in market consulting services  and business development teams 
the products and marketing group combines our product 
table of contents management  product development  marketing and customer support functions  as well as a new innovation team chartered with looking at longer term product line synergies and emerging market trends 
with our decision to divest all non core business lines  the businesses identified for sale have retained or are in the process of developing separate sales  consulting  product marketing and other capabilities that would have otherwise been delivered through our sales and consulting services and products and marketing organizations 
business highlights total revenues from our internet services group increased million  primarily due to continued growth in our naming services and information and security services businesses 
total revenues from our communications services group decreased million  primarily due to a decline in revenues that resulted from the divestiture of our majority ownership interest in our jamba business unit in january we saw a increase in in active domain names for 
com and 
net under management 
the increase is primarily due to increased demand for new domain names and high renewal rates for existing domain names 
we saw a increase in in our installed base of ssl certificates 
the growth is driven by increased demand for our verisign  geotrust and thawte branded certificates 
in january  we sold of our ownership interest in our jamba subsidiary to fox entertainment fox  a subsidiary of news corporation  for approximately million in cash 
our total net gain from the divestiture was approximately million 
in august  we issued billion principal amount of junior subordinated convertible debentures due august   to an initial purchaser in a private offering 
we received net proceeds of billion after deduction of issuance costs of million 
we used the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million  million and million for goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment  respectively  related to our content services business reporting unit

table of contents we account for all of our significant acquisitions as business combinations using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
accordingly  the acquired companies revenues  costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition 
as a result of our acquisitions in and  revenues  costs and expenses for the years ended december    and may not be comparable 
see note  business combinations  of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business acquisitions over the last three years 
joint ventures on january   we entered into two joint venture agreements with fox  a subsidiary of news corporation  to provide mobile entertainment to consumers on a global basis 
fox paid verisign approximately million in cash for a ownership interest in jamba and we paid fox approximately million in cash for its contribution of fox mobile entertainment assets 
as a result  fox owns a interest and verisign owns a interest in the joint ventures 
we recognized a gain of approximately million upon the divestiture of our majority ownership interest in jamba and recorded our interests in the joint ventures as investments in unconsolidated entities as of december  during the third quarter of  we invested million in the joint ventures pursuant to capital calls approved by the board of managers of the joint ventures 
the purpose of the capital calls was to fund the ongoing business and working capital needs of the joint ventures 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  we have agreed to invest an additional amount of approximately million in the two joint ventures 
in  we provided a working capital loan of million under a promissory note to the joint ventures 
this loan is outstanding as of december   and is included in other assets 
in connection with the joint ventures  verisign and fox entered into various put and call agreements 
we calculated the initial fair value of our written call options to be million using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recorded the fair value of the call options within other long term liabilities  and will mark to market the call options at each reporting period 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million  on joint venture call options within other income  net 
see note  joint ventures  of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our joint ventures 
discontinued operations we account for discontinued operations when all criteria of sfas are met 
accordingly  we have reclassified the financial data for all periods presented to reflect the following discontinued operations jamba service business in september  we sold our wholly owned jamba service gmbh subsidiary jamba service  which marketed insurance and extended service warranties to consumers for mobile electronic equipment and products  for approximately million in cash and recorded a net gain of million 
jamba service operations were recorded through august  jamba service was part of the communications services group segment 
payment gateway business on november   we completed the sale of certain assets related to our payment gateway business to paypal  inc and paypal international limited for million in cash 
the payment gateway business was part of the internet services group 

table of contents subsequent events in january and february of  we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program for an aggregate cost of million 
as of february  we have approximately million available under the stock repurchase program 
on january   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program stock repurchase program having an aggregate purchase price of up to million of our common stock 
on february   we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement to repurchase million of our common stock under the stock repurchase program and announced an intent to repurchase up to an additional million in open market transactions under the stock repurchase program 
we paid million to a financial institution in exchange for a number of shares  which will be determined  subject to a cap  based on market prices during the term of the asr agreement 
through february  we received million shares under the asr agreement 
we expect to complete the asr by the end of the third quarter of  although in certain circumstances the completion date may be shortened or extended 
on february   our board of directors approved the sale of our digital brand management services business unit  one of the businesses within the internet services group 
in accordance with sfas  the associated assets and liabilities of this business will be classified as held for sale and its operations will be reported as discontinued operations in the first quarter of critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  long lived assets  restructuring liability  contingent convertible debt  stock based compensation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on our judgment and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided 
our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 
revenues from consulting services are recognized either on a time and materials basis as the services are performed  or for fixed price consulting as services are performed  completed and accepted 
in some cases  fixed price consulting is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting 
proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project 
we 
table of contents have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
revenues from time and materials are recognized as services are performed 
in june  the fasb issued eitf no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
eitf provides guidance on an entity s disclosure of its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain taxes and provides that if taxes included in gross revenues are significant  a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented ie  both interim and annual periods 
taxes within the scope of eitf are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction 
we record transaction based taxes on a net basis 
these taxes are recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable  or approximately million 
a change of basis points in our estimate would amount to approximately million 
the following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense provision for doubtful accounts valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  such goodwill and other intangible assets may also be tested for impairment between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  c unanticipated competition  d loss of key personnel  e a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  f testing for recoverability under sfas of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  g recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
we performed our annual impairment tests as of june   and the fair value of our reporting units is determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
under the market approach  the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
in the application of the income and market valuation approaches  we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual 
table of contents future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
there were no impairment charges for goodwill from the annual impairment tests conducted as of june   and at december   we performed an additional impairment test primarily as a result of our decision to divest our non core businesses 
as a result of the impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million  million and million for goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment  respectively  related to our content services business reporting unit 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of its annual or periodic analyses  the company makes estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
although the company s cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
the company also considers its market capitalization on the date it performs the analysis 
as the company divests its non core businesses  it may incur further charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the net book value of its reporting units exceeds the estimated fair value 
any additional future impairment charges could adversely affect the company s earnings 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
restructuring charges we record restructuring charges related to workforce reduction in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  since benefits are provided pursuant to a severance plan which uses a standard formula of paying benefits based upon tenure with the company 
the accounting for such restructuring charges meets the four requirements of sfas which are i our obligation relating to employees rights to receive compensation for future absences is attributable to employees services already rendered  ii the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate  iii payment of the compensation is probable  and iv the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we record restructuring charges related to excess facilities and other exit costs in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be measured and recognized initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of 
table of contents office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 
contingent convertible debentures we account for our contingent convertible debentures and related provisions in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and eitf no 
 the meaning of indexed to a company s own stock  eitf no 
eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share and eitf  convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion 
we also evaluate the instruments in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments and measurement of fair value for accounting purposes 
eitf requires us to include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met 
we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and the current ability to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash 
this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the initial conversion price per share of 
we consider the embedded features related to the contingent interest payments  over allotment option  and our ability to make specific types of distributions eg  extraordinary dividends to qualify as derivatives  and bundle them as a compound embedded derivative under sfas the fair value of the derivative at the date of issuance of the debentures is accounted for as a discount on the debentures 
the over allotment feature which was revalued on the date of exercise is accounted for as a premium on the debentures 
the debt discount and the debt premium are being accreted to the face value of the debentures as interest expense  net  over the maturity period of the debentures 
any change in the fair value of this embedded derivative is recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in other income  net 
we account for our investments in joint ventures as equity method investments  based on our ability to exert significant influence but not control over the joint ventures 
verisign records its investments at the amount of capital contributed plus its percentage interest in the joint ventures earnings or loss 
we regularly review the operating and financial results based on information provided by these joint ventures  and determine the fair values of these investments based on a valuation performed using the income approach and the market approach 
if it is determined that an other than temporary decline exists in the fair values of these investments  we write down the investments to their fair value and record the related impairments in earnings from unconsolidated entities 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r replaced sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
we elected the modified prospective application method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
for stock based awards granted on or after january   we will amortize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the sfas pro forma disclosures 

table of contents we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and or cancellations 
expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we use the monte carlo simulation option pricing model to determine the fair value of market based awards 
the monte carlo simulation option pricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the black scholes model  however  it also further incorporates into the fair value determination  the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and the impact of the possible differing stock price paths 
compensation costs related to awards with a market based condition will be recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied  provided that the requisite service has been provided 
the stock based compensation expense for market based awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each such award 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
see note  stock based compensation  of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
income taxes we adopted fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin was a decrease in income taxes payable of million  an increase in long term deferred tax assets of million  and a decrease in the january   accumulated deficit balance of million 
included in this amount is an adjustment made by the company to increase accumulated deficit by million in the fourth quarter of at the adoption date of january   we had an unrecognized tax benefit for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions of million 
as of december   this amount was million

we recorded million of unrealized gain on the joint venture call options and million of realized and unrealized losses on the embedded derivative associated with our convertible debentures 
due to the fact that we are required to mark to market the fair value of these call options and the embedded derivative at each reporting period  such revaluations could result in further gains or losses 
other activity during included a million net loss on the sale of investments and a million gain on the divestiture of a business unit

our effective tax rate in differs from primarily because of the impairment to goodwill which is nondeductible for tax purposes  the reduction in our valuation allowance  and the implementation in of a global business structure 
our effective tax rate in also differs from because we were granted relief from the internal revenue service irs in for an uncertainty regarding a tax benefit resulting from a prior divestiture 
as a result  we benefited income tax expense of million in prior to  we provided a tax valuation allowance on our united states us federal and state deferred tax assets based on our evaluation that realizability of such assets was not more likely than not as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
we continuously evaluated additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
such deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  temporary differences on tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets  and temporary differences on deferred revenue 
in  based on additional evidence regarding our past earnings  scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities  we determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be 
table of contents realized 
accordingly  we released our valuation allowance of million from our deferred tax assets resulting in a benefit to deferred tax expense in its statement of operations 
we continue to assess the future realization of net us deferred tax assets and believe that it is more likely than not that forecasted income  tax effects of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities will be sufficient to support future realization of net us deferred tax assets 
we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets which we do not believe are more likely than not that they would be realized 
we continue to apply a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards and to book impairments of investments  due to the limited carryforward period and character of such tax attributes 
the amount of deferred tax assets which continues to be subject to a valuation allowance was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
as of december   we had us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  related to the settlement of employee stock awards 
when recognized pursuant to the implementation guidance in sfas r  these net operating losses will result in a benefit to additional paid in capital

if we are not able to use them  the us federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire  but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary

of the million federal research credit carry forward  million will be recognized as a benefit to paid in capital when utilized 
the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire  if not utilized  in through most state research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
we experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than percent in and these changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize certain us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward  but are subject to the expiration dates described above 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of such earnings at december   was million  principally from verisign japan kk and verisign switzerland sa 
these earnings have been permanently reinvested and verisign does not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the undistributed foreign earnings 
we are currently under examination by the irs and the california franchise tax board for the years ended december  and december  we are also under examination by numerous state taxing jurisdictions 
because we use historic net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset our taxable income in current and future years  such attributes can be adjusted by the irs and other taxing authorities until the statute closes on the year in which such attribute was utilized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our short term investment management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after tax returns 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
we invest in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and we did not have any fixed income marketable securities 

table of contents notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than months 
at december   we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high quality financial institutions 
market risk management the fair market value of the junior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures issued by the company and due august  is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the debentures was approximately billion  based on quoted market prices
