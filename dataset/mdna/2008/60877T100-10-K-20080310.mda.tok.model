item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results 
there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview momenta is a biotechnology company with a product pipeline of both novel and complex generic drugs 
this pipeline is derived from our proprietary  innovative technology platform for the detailed structural analysis of complex mixture drugs 
we use this platform to study the structure thorough characterization of chemical components  structure process design and control of manufacturing process  and structure activity relating structure to biological and clinical activity of complex mixture drugs  resulting in our product pipeline of both complex generic and novel drugs 
our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a technology enabled generic version of lovenox  a widely prescribed low molecular weight heparin  or lmwh 
in  we formed a collaboration  the sandoz collaboration  with sandoz nv and sandoz inc  collectively sandoz  affiliates of novartis ag  to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin in the us in august  sandoz submitted an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  to the fda for the syringe formulation of m enoxaparin 
the anda was amended in to include a paragraph iv certification stating that sanofi aventis patents for lovenox listed in the fda s listing of approved drug products  the orange book  are  among other things  invalid or unenforceable 
in july  we entered into a series of agreements  including a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement with novartis pharma ag and a memorandum of understanding  or mou  with sandoz ag  an affiliate of novartis pharma ag 
in june  we and sandoz ag executed a definitive collaboration and license agreement  or the definitive agreement  which superseded the mou 
we refer to this series of agreements collectively as the sandoz collaboration 
under the sandoz collaboration  we expanded the geographic markets covered by the sandoz collaboration related to m enoxaparin to include the european union and further agreed to exclusively collaborate on the development and commercialization of three other follow on and complex generic products for sale in specified regions of the world 
since our inception in may  we have incurred annual net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we recognized net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we develop our product candidates  expand our research and development activities and prepare for the commercial launch of our product candidates 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
our revenues for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  have been derived from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and primarily consist of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs for certain programs 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses 
in july  we raised million in a follow on public offering  net of expenses  from the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in september  in connection with the sandoz collaboration  we sold  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag for an aggregate purchase price of million 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resource expenditures to the research and development of our product candidates 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any revenue from product sales and are uncertain whether or not we will generate any revenue from the sale of products over the next several years 
we have recognized  in the aggregate  million of revenue from our inception through december  this revenue was derived entirely from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration 
we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of research and development payments  profit sharing payments  milestone payments and royalties in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and similar future collaborative or strategic relationships 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  contract research and manufacturing  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs development programs m enoxaparin our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a generic version of lovenox 
lovenox is a widely prescribed lmwh used for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
under our sandoz collaboration  we work with sandoz exclusively to develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin in the us and sandoz is responsible for funding substantially all of the us related m enoxaparin development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs 
the total cost of development and commercialization  and the timing of m enoxaparin product launch  are subject to uncertainties relating to the development  regulatory approval and legal processes 
in accordance with our sandoz collaboration  sandoz submitted andas in its name to the fda for m enoxaparin in syringe and vial forms seeking approval to market m enoxaparin in the united states 
both andas currently include a paragraph iv certification stating that sanofi aventis patents listed in the orange book for lovenox are  among other things  invalid and unenforceable 
the fda is currently reviewing both m enoxaparin andas  including our manufacturing data and technology and characterization methodology 
in november  sandoz received a letter from the fda stating that the syringe anda for m enoxaparin was not approvable in its current form because the anda does not adequately address the potential for immunogenicity of the drug product 
we and sandoz are working together to address the fda s questions and determine the information necessary to obtain approval of m enoxaparin 
based on our work to date  we believe that we will not need to conduct clinical trials to address the fda s questions  but we cannot be assured of this yet 
we are preparing for the commercialization of m enoxaparin  if and when approved  by advancing manufacturing  supply chain  and sales and marketing objectives 
however  we cannot predict the timing of any action by the fda related to the m enoxaparin anda 
our sandoz collaboration expanded our collaboration efforts related to m enoxaparin to include the european union 
under the sandoz collaboration  we will share certain development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs as well as a portion of the profits  if any 
m m is a novel anticoagulant that was rationally designed with the goal of providing improved clinical anticoagulant properties to support the treatment of patients diagnosed with acs and stable angina 
we believe that m has the potential to provide baseline anticoagulant therapy to treat coronary artery disease and patients with acs or stable angina who require invasive treatment  as well as those acs patients who are medically managed  or do not require invasive treatment 
m is designed to be a reversible and monitorable anticoagulant that can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously and have a pharmacokinetic profile similar to other lmwhs 
we believe that these properties of m have the potential to provide greater flexibility than other therapies presently used to treat patients diagnosed with acs and stable angina 
in july  we filed our investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda for our m intravenous injection formulation  and in october began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 
in october  we began a phase a clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing m intravenous injection formulation as an anticoagulant in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
in march  we filed our ind for our m subcutaneous formulation  and in may began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 
m m is designed to be a technology enabled generic version of copaxone  a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polypeptide chains 
copaxone is indicated for reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapse remitting multiple sclerosis 
multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration 
in north america  copaxone is marketed through teva neuroscience llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  and distributed by sanofi aventis 
teva and sanofi aventis have an additional collaborative arrangement for the marketing of copaxone in europe and other markets  under which copaxone is either co promoted with teva or is marketed solely by sanofi aventis 
under the definitive agreement  we and sandoz jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m we are responsible for funding substantially all of the us related m development costs  with sandoz responsible for legal and commercialization costs 
outside of the us  we and sandoz share equally the development costs  with sandoz responsible for commercialization and legal costs 
glycoproteins glycoproteins are proteins to which sugar molecules are attached 
examples of glycoprotein drugs are erythropoietin  blood clotting factors and interferon beta 
we are applying our technology to the development of generic or biosimilar glycoprotein drugs 
we believe that this technology can further be used in assisting pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in developing improved and next generation versions of their branded products by analyzing and modifying the sugar structures contained in the branded products  and can also be used to engineer novel complex mixture drugs 
our glycoprotein program is focused on extending our technology for the analysis of complex sugars to glycoproteins 
the goal of the program is to facilitate the development of generic or biosimilar versions of major marketed glycoprotein drugs 
under our sandoz collaboration  we are currently applying our technology to develop two follow on proteins in partnership with sandoz ag 
we refer to these two product candidates as m and m discovery program we are also applying our analytical capabilities to drug discovery 
our discovery program is focused on the role that complex sugars play in biological systems  including regulating the development and progression of disease 
our initial focus is in the area of cancer  where we are seeking to discover sugar sequences with anti cancer properties for development as therapeutics  and we are advancing an oncology product candidate that is in the advanced discovery phase 
sugars play a part in the conversion of normal cells into cancerous cells  the regulation of tumor growth and tumor invasion and metastasis 
we believe that our technology can provide us with a better understanding of the role of sugars in disease  enabling us to discover novel sugar therapeutics  as well as to discover new disease mechanisms that can be targeted with other small molecule and biologic drugs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  legal  accounting  investor relations  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility and insurance costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services and other general expenses 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue revenue for was million  compared with million for and million for revenue for the year ended december  consists of i amounts earned by us under our sandoz collaboration for reimbursement of research and development services  reimbursement of development costs and amortization of the initial payment received and ii amounts earned by us under our sandoz collaboration for amortization of the equity premium  reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs 
revenue increased million from to due primarily to million of reimbursable expenditures associated with the first year of the sandoz collaboration  a million increase in reimbursable development expenditures associated with preparing for the potential commercial launch of m enoxaparin in the us  and million of the first year of amortization related to the equity premium 
the increase of million from to is entirely attributable to our sandoz collaboration 
these revenues consist of amounts earned by us for payment by sandoz of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs for m enoxaparin and amortization of the initial payment received under our sandoz collaboration 
the increase in revenues was the result of increased reimbursable expenditures associated with preparing for the potential commercial launch of m enoxaparin in the us research and development research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million from to principally resulted from an increase of million in manufacturing and process development costs and research conducted by third parties in support of our m  m enoxaparin and glycoprotein programs  million in clinical trial costs for our m program  million in personnel and related costs associated with the growth in our research and development organization  million in laboratory supplies and a million in process research and development charge related to the parivid asset purchase 
the increase of million from to principally resulted from an increase of million in manufacturing and process development costs and research conducted by third parties  million in personnel and related costs  million in stock based compensation  of which million was related to the adoption of sfas r  million in laboratory expenses  million in facilities costs  million in consultant costs and million in depreciation expense 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase in support of our product candidates 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenditures for our principal research and development programs for the years ended december   and certain prior year amounts have been reclassified due to a current year change in the allocation method for indirect costs 
research and development expense in thousands development programs    discovery programs    other research   total research and development expense    development programs the increase in expenditures on development programs of million from to was primarily related to increases in the expenses of our m  m  m enoxaparin and glycoprotein programs 
our m program manufacturing and research costs have increased as we continue to advance the program 
m clinical costs have increased as we have progressed from preclinical to phase studies 
m enoxaparin manufacturing costs have increased as we prepare for potential commercial launch 
our glycoprotein program expenditures have increased as we devote additional headcount resources to facilitate the development of follow on versions of glycoprotein drugs 
the increase in expenditures on development programs of million from to was primarily related to preclinical and toxicology work to support the m ind filing  commencement of our phase clinical studies for m  manufacturing and professional fees related to our m enoxaparin program and the development expenses of our m program 
discovery programs the discovery program expenditures from to include a decrease of approximately million due to the termination of the drug delivery program in late  offset by increased oncology program expenditures of approximately million representing additional resources dedicated to applying our analytical capabilities to drug discovery 
the million increase in expenses in our discovery programs from to was primarily related to increased expenditures to support our disease biology and drug delivery programs 
other research the decrease in both years in other research expense was primarily due to a decrease in headcount and headcount related costs relating to general technology development and support activities as resources are allocated to development programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in general and administrative expense decreased by million from to primarily due to a decrease of million in professional fees due to a reduction in legal activities  offset by an increase of million in personnel and related costs due to increased headcount 
general and administrative expense increased by million from to due primarily to an increase of million in stock based compensation  of which million was related to the adoption of sfas r  increases of million in professional fees and other legal expenses and million in personnel and related costs 
we anticipate increases in general and administrative expenses to support our research and development programs 
these increases will likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
we expect to incur increased internal and external legal and business development costs to support our various product development efforts  which can vary from period to period 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to novartis pharma ag in september the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to novartis pharma ag in september and from our follow on public offering in july interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million from to and million from to was primarily due to additional amounts drawn from our equipment line of credit during and liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  borrowings from our lines of credit  and capital lease obligations 
since our inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in july  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in september  we received net proceeds of million from novartis pharma ag s purchase of  shares of our common stock in connection with the sandoz collaboration 
as of december   we have received a cumulative total of million from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  million from debt financing  million from capital lease obligations  million from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility  and additional funds from interest income 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in addition  we also hold million in restricted cash  which serves as collateral for a letter of credit related to our facility lease 
during the years ended december   and  our operating activities used million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash for operating activities generally approximates our net loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our net losses have increased year over year as we increase our headcount and continue to develop our product candidates 
for the year ended december   our net loss adjusted for non cash items was million 
in addition  the net change in our operating assets and liabilities provided million and resulted from increases in accounts receivable of million and unbilled collaboration revenue of million due to timing of cash receipts from our sole customer and an increase in billable activities  a decrease in restricted cash of million due to the cancellation of a letter of credit for the third street sublease  an increase in accounts payable of million resulting from increased manufacturing and research costs for our programs  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million representing amortization of the million equity investment premium paid by novartis in connection with the sandoz collaboration 
for the year ended december   our net loss adjusted for non cash items was million 
in addition  the net change in our operating assets and liabilities provided million  primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of million relating to the equity investment premium paid by novartis in connection with the sandoz collaboration offset by the restriction of million in conjunction with a letter of credit for the third street sublease 
remaining increases of approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to general increases in our business activities as a result of greater headcount and increased product development costs 
for the year ended december   our net loss adjusted for non cash items was million  and the net change in our operating assets and liabilities provided million 
increases in operating assets and liabilities were due to the collection of million in for receivables from and an increase in accrued expenses of million due to increases in headcount related expenses and product development costs 
these increases were offset by the effects of increases in unbilled collaboration revenue and prepaid expenses of million due to greater reimbursable development spend over the prior year and an increase in interest receivable due to higher average investment balances 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  offset by cash provided of million in maturities of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  offset by cash provided of million in maturities of marketable securities 
during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  offset by cash provided of million in maturities of marketable securities 
during the years ended december   and  we used million  million and million  to purchase laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we borrowed million on an equipment lease agreement entered into in december  recovered million in property and equipment from the assignment of the third street sublease  received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and purchases of common shares through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by principal payments of million on our line of credit and lease agreement obligations and payments of million on financed leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag of which million is included in deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  additionally  we borrowed million on an equipment lease agreement entered into in december  received million in financing from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility  and received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and purchases of common shares through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by principal payments of million on our line of credit and lease agreement obligations and payments of million on financed leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we received proceeds of million from our follow on public offering of common stock in july  million from our line of credit obligation  million from our equipment lease agreement entered into in december  million from stock option exercises  purchases of common shares through our employee stock purchase plan and a payment related to restricted stock 
the total proceeds of million were offset by million in principal payments on our line of credit obligation 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total through through after license maintenance obligations short and long term line of credit obligation capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations     total contractual obligations     after  the annual obligations  which extend indefinitely  are approximately million per year 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accrued expenses and certain equity instruments 
prior to our initial public offering  we also evaluated our estimates and judgments regarding the fair valuation assigned to our common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services are deferred and recognized over the performance period 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue is recognized is based on estimates by management and may change over the course of the performance period 
at the inception of a collaboration agreement  we estimate the term of our performance obligation based on our development plans and our estimate of the regulatory review period 
the development plans generally include designing a manufacturing process to make the drug product  scaling up the process  contributing to the preparation of regulatory filings  further scaling up the manufacturing process to commercial scale and related development of intellectual property 
each reporting period we reassess our remaining performance obligations under the applicable collaboration arrangement by considering the time period over which any remaining development and related services to be provided prior to obtaining regulatory approval are expected to be completed 
changes in our estimate could occur due to changes in our development plans or due to changes in regulatory or legal requirements 
we have deferred upfront payments of million and million in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  respectively 
such upfront payments are being recognized over our estimated period of performance obligation  which is approximately five and six years  respectively  from the applicable collaboration inception date 
in december  we revised our estimate of the development period under the sandoz collaboration agreement due to a change in the projected timing of certain activities required for the completion of the fda s review of the anda for m enoxaparin 
the change in estimate did not have a material impact on the company s net loss or net loss per share for the year ended december  revenue from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  effective january  under the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation expense in our operations  and accordingly the adoption of sfas r fair value method has had and will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and provided pro forma disclosures of net loss attributable and net loss per share allocable to common stockholders as if we had adopted the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas we determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected term of an option 
in determining our volatility  we have considered implied volatilities of currently traded options to provide an estimate of volatility based upon current trading activity in addition to our historical volatility 
after considering other such factors as our stage of development and the length of time we have been public  we believe a blended volatility rate based upon historical performance  as well as the implied volatilities of currently traded options  best reflects the expected volatility of our stock going forward 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause stock based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
the expected term of awards represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding 
we use a blend of our own historical employee exercise and post vest termination behavior and expected term data from our peer group to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
for purposes of identifying similar entities  we considered characteristics such as industry  stage of life cycle and financial leverage 
we update these assumptions on a quarterly basis to reflect recent historical data 
additionally  we are required to estimate forfeiture rates to approximate the number of shares that will vest in a period to which the fair value is applied 
we will continually monitor employee exercise behavior and may further adjust the estimated term and forfeiture rates in future periods 
increasing the estimated life would result in an increase in the fair value to be recognized over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures will be adjusted to actual forfeitures upon the vest date of the cancelled options as a cumulative adjustment on a quarterly basis 
the risk free interest rates used in the black scholes merton option pricing model are based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock option 
the value of our restricted stock awards is recognized as compensation cost in our consolidated statements of operations over each award s explicit or implicit service periods 
we estimate an award s implicit service period based on our best estimate of the period over which an award s vesting conditions will be achieved 
we reevaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and will recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation as of the date of an estimate revision over the revised remaining implicit service period 
in december  we revised the implicit service period for certain performance based restricted stock awards due to a change in the expected vesting date 
as a result of this change in estimate  our net loss and net loss per share for the year ended december  was million and per share  respectively  less than had the estimate remained unchanged 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized total stock based compensation expense under sfas r of million and million  respectively 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option awards amounted to million  including estimated forfeitures  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of years 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards amounted to million  including estimated forfeitures  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of approximately years 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and the assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas will be effective for our fiscal year  although early adoption is permitted 
we do not currently believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas  which allows an entity to elect to record financial assets and liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition on a contract by contract basis 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as the changes occur 
sfas also establishes additional disclosure requirements for these items stated at fair value 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  provided that we also adopt sfas we do not currently believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  a replacement for sfas no 
 business combinations 
the statement retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
 but requires the recognition of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at their acquisition date fair values 
additionally  sfas no 
r supersedes fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date 
sfas no 
r now requires that purchased research and development be recognized as an intangible asset 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r prospectively for any acquisitions on or after january  and are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued eitf issued  accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf requires collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
further  eitf clarified the determination of whether transactions within a collaborative arrangement are part of a vendor customer or analogous relationship subject to eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf will be effective for us beginning on january  we do not currently believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf the task forces reached a consensus that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
if an entity s expectations change such that it does not expect it will need the goods to be delivered or the services to be rendered  capitalized nonrefundable advance payments should be charged to expense 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
the consensus may not be applied to earlier periods 
early adoption of the provisions is not permitted 
we do not currently believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas requires that noncontrolling interests be reported as a separate component of equity  that net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations  that changes in a parent s ownership interest be accounted for as equity transactions  and that  when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value 
sfas will be applied prospectively  except for presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively  as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year we do not currently have any noncontrolling interests  and therefore the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  or  we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative  foreign currency or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
