debt ratings 
the company receives debt credit ratings from standard poor s ratings group  inc s p and moody s investors service  inc 
moodys  which are subject to regular reviews 
s p s rating for the company is bb with a stable outlook 
moodys rating for the company is ba with a negative outlook 
s p and moodys consider many factors in determining the company s ratings including production growth opportunities  liquidity  debt levels and asset and reserve mix 
a reduction in the company s debt ratings could negatively impact the company s ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate  fees and other terms associated with such additional financing

book capitalization and current ratio 
the company s book capitalization at december  was billion  consisting of debt of billion and stockholders equity of billion

to at december   as compared to 
to at december  critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with gaap 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a comprehensive discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
following is a discussion of the company s most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the company s application of gaap 
asset retirement obligations 
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore the land or seabeds at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the company s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations  a corresponding adjustment is generally made to the oil and gas property balance 
see notes b and l of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s asset retirement obligations 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  the company believes that  during periods of active exploration  net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
during  and  the company recognized exploration  abandonment  geological and geophysical expense from i continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively  and ii discontinued operations of million  million and million  respectively  under the successful efforts method 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report as of december   and were prepared by the company s engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the company s major properties 
estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify  positively or negatively  material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves 
it should not be assumed that the standardized measure included in this report as of december  is the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the standardized measure on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
see item a 
risk factors for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves 
the company s estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the company s assessment of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
the company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
at december   the company carried unproved property costs of million 
management periodically assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impacts the amount and timing of impairment provisions  if any 
suspended wells 
the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery 
the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions 
if the company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields  the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense 
the company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheets for more than one year following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following conditions are met i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well 
ii the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain projects  it may take the company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability 
in these instances  the project s feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology  but rather the company s ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information  gaining access to other companies production  transportation or processing facilities and or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells 
these activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly 
consequently  the company s assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s suspended exploratory well costs 
assessments of functional currencies 
management determines the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues  costs and expenses 
the us dollar is the functional currency of all of the company s current international operations 
the assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration 
pioneer monitors company specific  oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the company s net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period 
as of december   the company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
goodwill impairment 
the company reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually 
this requires the company to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill 
there is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values  particularly in the estimation of proved reserves as described above 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 
litigation and environmental contingencies 
the company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation 
actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons 
the costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages 
similarly  environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations  developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 
under gaap  a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s commitments and contingencies 
valuations of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
the company is the sponsor of certain defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
in accordance with gaap  the company is required to estimate the present value of its unfunded pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
based on those values  the company records the unfunded obligations of those plans and records ongoing service costs and associated interest expense 
the valuation of the company s pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations requires management assumptions and judgments as to benefit cost inflation factors  mortality rates and discount factors 
changes in these factors may materially change future benefit costs and pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
see new accounting pronouncements below and note h of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
valuation of stock based compensation 
the company adopted the modified prospective approach as prescribed under sfas no 
r on january  under this approach  the company is required to expense all options and other stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the calculation of the fair value of stock based compensation requires the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary for using the various valuation methods utilized by the company 
the company utilizes a the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options  b the stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and c the monte carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards

 consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as minority interest  is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements 
among other requirements  sfas requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statement  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest 
sfas is effective for the company on january  and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements
