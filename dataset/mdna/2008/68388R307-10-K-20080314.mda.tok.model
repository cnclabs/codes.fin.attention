wowwee technologies rovio  a mobile telepresence robot  was introduced at the consumer electronics association international ces as the first product in the wowwee technologies line 
the rovio robot employs the northstar system from evolution robotics to locate and navigate user defined waypoints in its immediate environment 
streaming audio and video through any web accessible device  rovio provides robotic surveillance and telepresence 
our competitive strengths we believe that wowwee s key competitive strengths are in product development  engineering and design  including its ability to work with third party manufacturers to develop innovative consumer technology based products 
we believe that wowwee s core competency is its ability to identify cutting edge technologies and  through its flexible design process  to incorporate these technologies in the development of innovative products 
the rovio robot  incorporating evolution robotics northstar technology  femisapien  with extreme agility and controller free  touch based control via its four way joystick hands  the flytech products  incorporating technology that allows for the commercial production of ornithopters  and the flytech bladestar  with its onboard sensor based navigation  are some recent examples of this core competency 
wowwee has developed robust partnerships with high quality chinese manufacturers that have demonstrated their commitment to wowwee by investing in advanced manufacturing methodologies and human resources to support wowwee s product development process 
wowwee s design and engineering team takes a hands on approach  managing these manufacturing relationships with a view to ensuring that each product is manufactured and assembled at the highest quality levels 
we believe that our acquisition of the wowwee business will provide it with greater financial and operational resources to grow  both in north america and internationally  and a greater ability to capitalize on its corporate brands through the development of a cross platform entertainment media strategy 
our business strategy we expect to implement specific strategies in order to enhance wowwee s growth and financial performance 
these strategies include expanding sales and distribution through a broadening of the sales channels  particularly outside north america in emerging markets  expanding product design  development and production capabilities to produce an increased number of products at varying price points  broadening development initiatives into products that combine computer connectivity  utility and entertainment  embarking on branded entertainment initiatives  licensing  publishing and merchandising  and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
our customers wowwee products are sold in a range of brick and mortar channels including grocery stores  pharmacies  toy shops  department stores and high end consumer technologies stores 
key north american retailer customers include best buy circuit city jc penney macy s radio shack sears k mart target toys r us the sharper image wal mart 
each of these retailer customers  as well as most other brick and mortar retailer customers in the us  also carries the full line of wowwee products on its internet sales site 
online sales of wowwee s products are also made through internet based e tailers such as amazon and buy 
com 
manufacturing wowwee s products are produced in china by third party manufacturers with which wowwee has long standing relationships 
consistent with industry practice  the use of third party manufacturers allows wowwee to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs  while improving flexibility  capacity and production technology 
by outsourcing its manufacturing process  wowwee maintains a flexible business model that enables it to be responsive to changing technology 
in addition  once a product has reached its commercialization phase  wowwee is able to minimize inventory risk by manufacturing products based upon actual customer orders 
upon final assembly  products can be shipped directly from the manufacturing locations to retailers and distributors  with title to the products passing to retailer customers in china 
although wowwee does not conduct the day to day manufacturing of its products  it is extensively involved in the design of the product prototype and production tools  dies and moulds for its products and seeks to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the production process and testing the products produced by its manufacturers 
wowwee employs quality control inspectors who rotate among its manufacturers factories to monitor the production of substantially all of its products 
wowwee s quality assurance personnel advise as to compliance with applicable regulations during each phase of product development  and perform compliance testing  and coordinate third party independent compliance testing  on all wowwee products 
see government regulation below 
once pre production testing has been completed and product production has been approved  wowwee s quality assurance personnel monitor production at the manufacturer s facility for compliance with wowwee s quality requirements 
suppliers the principal raw materials used in the production and sale of wowwee s products are plastics  metals  plush  integrated circuits and standard electronic components  all of which are currently available from a variety of sources 
although wowwee does not manufacture its products  it owns the tools  dies and moulds used in the manufacturing process  and these are transferable among manufacturers should wowwee choose to employ alternative manufacturers 
sales  marketing and distribution within the united states and canada  wowwee sells its products directly to its retailer customers through its direct sales channel and through independent sales representatives 
for retailers across the rest of the world  wowwee utilizes a network of distributors located in various jurisdictions 
wowwee products are also available for sale through wowwee s internet based store www 
wowweestore 
com 
in  approximately of its products were sold in north america  with the balance being sold internationally 
wowwee does not have written agreements with its customers 
instead  sales are made based on purchase orders  primarily against letters of credit 
the majority of orders are traditionally written during the first two quarters of the year  with shipments occurring throughout the year as new product becomes available 
the majority of the product shipments occur during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
wowwee presents products to its customers at trade shows  such as international ces  and various toy fairs  as well as at private meetings throughout the year 
wowwee generally introduces new products to its major customers during the year prior to the year of their introduction for retail sale 
wowwee employs a range of advertising and promotional vehicles to promote its products to consumers including broadcast  internet and print advertising  pr outreach  and exhibition at consumer expos such as digital life 
wowwee also maintains a corporate website and individual sites for its brands and products 
wowwee products have been recognized for excellence in technology  design and quality by numerous organizations around the world  most recently including popular mechanics editor s choice award flytech bladestar international ces  time magazine best inventions of the year flytech dragonfly  robosapien v bett award united kingdom 
in  products from the wowwee robotics product line were a featured mcdonald s happy meal boys brand in most mcdonald s territories worldwide 
research and development  product development wowwee s person engineering and design team develops new technologies using internal capabilities and seeks to identify emerging or underutilized innovations that are currently being developed or that are available in the marketplace 
in order to leverage the man hours invested in prior products  older generations of products frequently form the foundation for the next generation of products as well as new product lines 
new technologies are then integrated to enhance the overall functionality of the product 
in sourcing technologies  wowwee reviews the latest technology innovations at trade shows  conferences  colleges and universities  on the internet  and through word of mouth 
wowwee regularly reviews technologies or product concepts from third party sources that it believes could have potential synergies with wowwee s current product line or that could be successfully commercialized based upon wowwee s development process 
wowwee generally brings all sought after third party technologies in house  but once inside  allows its internal engineering and design team to develop new product concepts with relative autonomy 
wowwee also licenses third party technologies for development within unique consumer applications developed by wowwee 
in the course of its product development  wowwee leverages its retail relationships to help gauge potential consumer demand 
wowwee conducts roadshow meetings with its key retailer customers to solicit immediate feedback on its new product concepts 
based upon this early feedback  wowwee determines the course of further development or  as necessary  modifies the products 
in the early phases of product development  wowwee works with its third party manufacturers to engineer a manufacturing prototype to determine if the potential product can be manufactured on a commercially viable scale 
once further development work has been conducted  and a preliminary sample is available  wowwee moves to solicit further feedback from key retailer customers  and begins to take preliminary orders for the product 
if the initial orders from these key retailer customers indicates that the product might achieve sufficiently profitable unit sales  wowwee continues its development work and initiates the product tooling process with one of its product manufacturers 
safety testing of wowwee s products is done at the manufacturers facilities by quality control personnel employed by wowwee or by independent third party contractors engaged by wowwee 
safety testing is designed to ensure compliance with applicable product safety regulations see government regulation below 
in addition  certain of wowwee s larger customers use independent laboratories to test wowwee s products according to their own standards before shipment 
government regulation as a developer and supplier of consumer products  wowwee operates in a highly regulated environment in the united states and international markets 
in the united states  wowwee s products are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act cpsa  the federal hazardous substances act fhsa  the flammable fabrics act ffa and the regulations promulgated thereunder  as well as the rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc rules 
the cpsa and the fhsa enable the consumer products safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety regulations or otherwise create a substantial risk of injury  and articles that contain excessive amounts of a banned hazardous substance 
the ffa enables the cpsc to regulate and enforce flammability standards for fabrics used in consumer products 
the fcc rules require conformity with technical standards that limit radio frequency emissions in order to control potential interference to radio communications 
similar laws exist in various international markets 
wowwee maintains a quality control program designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws see research and development  product development above 
regulations that apply to the sale of wowwee s products also include guidelines for advertising directed toward children 
competition wowwee competes with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  importers and marketers in each of its product categories 
globally  certain of wowwee s competitors have greater financial resources  larger sales and marketing and product development departments  stronger brand name recognition  longer operating histories and benefit from greater economies of scale 
intellectual property all of wowwee s products are produced and sold under trademarks owned by it or  in certain cases  licensed to it 
wowwee typically registers its trademarks in the jurisdictions where its products are sold 
wowwee also files design patents in china and other jurisdictions for most of its products and has recently instituted a program under which utility patents will be filed where it is deemed appropriate as a means of protecting wowwee s proprietary technology 
wowwee maintains ownership of all of the tooling associated with its products 
employees as of december   wowwee employed full time employees 
its employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and it has never experienced a work stoppage

optimal payments our services optimal payments provides technology and services that businesses require to accept credit card  electronic check and direct debit payments 
optimal payments processes credit and debit card payments for card not present and card present transactions  including internet businesses  mail order telephone order merchants and retail point of sale merchants 
optimal payments also processes checks and direct debits online and by telephone 
for merchants that want to accept payments in a card not present environment  optimal payments provides the technology to integrate into the merchant s website  training  on going technical support  risk management to help detect and prevent fraudulent transactions  real time online reporting and administrative tools and settlement services 
for merchants that want to accept payments in a card present environment  optimal payments provides the necessary hardware  training and on going technical support 
settlement services for these merchants are provided by third party processors on an outsourced basis 
to help mitigate its risk exposure  optimal payments retains a portion of amounts owed to certain merchants based on processing dollar volume for a six month period to cover potential merchant credit losses  which can arise as a result of  among other things  disputes between consumers and merchants or credit card and check clearing association fines related to chargeback activity 
the aggregate amount withheld is referred to as held as reserves and optimal payments liability to refund its customers for these amounts is included in the line item customer reserves and security deposits on the balance sheet contained in our consolidated financial statements 
in the case of a dispute between a merchant and its customer  if the dispute is not resolved in the merchant s favour  the disputed transaction amount is refunded to the merchant s customer and charged back to optimal payments 
if it is unable to collect a chargeback amount from the merchant  optimal payments bears the credit risk for this amount 
as a result  optimal payments acquiring processing suppliers require it to maintain certain amounts with them as reserves 
amounts withheld by optimal payments acquiring processing suppliers as reserves are included in cash and short term investments on our balance sheet as held as reserves 
for merchants who use its services  optimal payments withholds reserves to help offset its exposure to chargebacks 
the reserves are collected and refunded on a rolling basis 
as new transactions are processed  optimal payments withholds a portion as the reserve  while at the same time refunding previously withheld reserves for which the six month period has expired 
our competitive strengths we believe that optimal payments principal competitive strengths are optimal payments has strong proprietary risk management expertise 
optimal payments proprietary risk management expertise helps to reduce the inherently higher level of risk associated with processing credit card and electronic check payments received by internet or telephone 
its proprietary risk management tools and processes are designed to handle a wide variety of transactions  the performance profiles of which vary 
these transactions may originate from consumers authorization and purchase  merchants settlement and credit or internal users query 
most of these transactions are initiated by the consumer because there are comparatively more consumers than there are merchants and merchant transactions relate to previously submitted consumer transactions 
with this knowledge  optimal payments has developed a unique proprietary transaction processor with an emphasis on the easy handling of customer submitted authorization and purchase transactions 
optimal payments maintains a proprietary transaction processing platform that it can tailor to meet the needs of its customers 
optimal payments has developed its own proprietary transaction processing technology  which has given it the flexibility to tailor its offerings to the needs of its merchants and internal users 
its network operations center is mission critical  fully redundant and benefits from automated network monitoring 
its transaction processing engine includes an internet merchant account  payment gateway  real time authorization  risk management and fraud protection  as well as back end reporting tools that help merchants manage their operations 
optimal payments electronic payment services can be integrated into a merchant s existing business systems 
optimal payments has invested significantly in its technology and we believe that the barriers to entry to the payment processing industry are high  largely due to the need to establish a substantial volume of processing in order to negotiate competitive pricing with acquiring banks  and particularly in the card not present processing industry due to the need to develop the technology and expertise required in order to securely process these types of transactions 
optimal payments provides dedicated customer service 
optimal payments internal account management staff is focused on meeting the needs of its merchant customers 
its larger card not present customers are assigned an account manager to help ensure that merchants expectations are met or exceeded 
for card not present merchants  optimal payments understands the importance of uptime  therefore its account managers ensure their availability and timely responses to any merchant inquiries 
optimal payments offers merchants comprehensive payment processing solutions 
optimal payments provides merchants with both card present and card not present processing options  risk management expertise  multi currency and multiple payment methods specifically pertaining to card not present transactions  a proprietary processing technology platform specifically pertaining to its card not present transactions  and a focus on customer care 
by offering both card present and card not present payment processing solutions  optimal payments offers merchants the simplicity of having one supplier for both of these services  reducing the administrative burden of having multiple payment processing suppliers and helping to allow merchants to focus on their core business 
our business strategy to continue to grow its payment processing business  optimal payments strategy is to provide merchants with the ability to process a variety of electronic transactions  including both card present and card not present credit and debit transactions 
although it will offer a wide variety of electronic transaction solutions  optimal payments will focus its efforts and strategy on marketing and selling its card not present transaction processing service 
we believe that optimal payments experience in processing card not present transactions  specifically its technology and risk management expertise  positions it as a leader in this area 
key elements of the optimal payments business strategy include further enhancing its risk management capabilities and solutions for its merchant customers  expanding its merchant customer base  expanding the currency options available in its solutions  and expanding the geographical availability of its solutions into new territories 
with its existing infrastructure and supplier relationships  we believe that optimal payments can accommodate expected industry growth 
we believe that its available capacity and infrastructure will allow optimal payments to benefit from operational efficiencies as it grows its processing volume 
our customers optimal payments provides services to over  small to medium sized merchants 
suppliers optimal payments key suppliers are its transaction processing suppliers  which are primarily financial institutions that are members of the visa and mastercard credit card associations and check clearing associations  such as the national automated clearing house association 
these relationships provide optimal payments with the ability to connect to the various payment networks and enable it to process various types of transactions in different geographic regions 
sales and marketing optimal payments sales efforts are conducted through direct sales  independent sales agents and strategic partnerships 
optimal payments employs an in house sales force whose focus is to sell its full range of services directly to merchants 
independent sales agents refer merchants to optimal payments in return for a commission based on the processing volume from the referred merchant 
optimal payments generates revenues primarily from fees charged to merchants for payment processing services 
fees charged to merchants typically include a discount rate based upon a percentage of the dollar amounts processed  and a variety of fixed transaction fees 
merchant fees are based upon the merchant s transaction volume and risk profile 
where optimal payments is the primary party responsible for providing processing services  revenue is recorded on a gross basis and amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier are recorded as part of our transaction processing expenses 
where optimal payments is not the primary party in providing a merchant with processing services  we record revenue net of amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier 
revenue is recognized at the time the transaction is performed 
research and development optimal payments recognizes the importance of having access to leading technology in order to be able to develop advanced services for its customers  independent sales agents and for its own internal use 
to this end  optimal payments maintains a team of development engineers  quality assurance professionals and technical code writers 
as of december   approximately employees were engaged in such activities 
government regulation as electronic commerce in general and most of the card not present services that optimal payments offers are relatively new developments  the manner in which existing state  provincial  federal and foreign government regulations may be applied is uncertain and difficult to predict 
due to the relatively recent development of online gaming  there are few laws or regulations that deal directly with online gaming payment processing and there is uncertainty as to the legal status of online gaming 
while some jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of reviewing legislation to regulate online gaming  other jurisdictions have enacted or propose to enact legislation intended to restrict or prohibit online gaming 
on october   the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of the act was enacted 
the act prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the internet 
the act instructs the us treasury department and federal reserve to impose new obligations upon financial institutions and other payment processors to establish procedures designed to block online gaming related financial transactions 
it also expressly requires internet bets and wagers to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the wagers are initiated and received 
upon the passage of the act  our then majority owned subsidiary fireone group plc ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
competition we believe that the payments markets are growing at a meaningful rate 
companies that either have developed or are developing product offerings in competition with optimal payments include ipayment inc  heartland payments systems  inc  paypal inc  telecheck international inc  transfirst holdings inc  datacash group plc and worldpay plc 
certain of optimal payments competitors are larger and have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
intellectual property we regard optimal payments software as proprietary and attempt to protect it  where applicable  with copyrights  trade secret measures and nondisclosure agreements 
despite these protections  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy aspects of its intellectual property or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets 
existing copyright laws afford only limited practical protection for computer software 
the laws of foreign countries generally do not protect optimal payments proprietary rights in its services to the same extent as the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates such as the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
in addition  optimal payments may experience more difficulty in enforcing its proprietary rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
employees as of december   optimal payments employed approximately full time employees 
its employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and it has never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that optimal payments employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common shares could decline due to any of these risks or other factors  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the risks described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
our business depends upon the services of key personnel 
our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and to grow our business depends largely upon the services of our co chairman  our co chairman and chief executive officer and our chief financial officer  the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business and overall results of operations 
wowwee s future success depends largely on the continued contribution of its key designers and technical personnel 
the loss of services of any of these key personnel could harm wowwee 
recruiting skilled designers and technical personnel is highly competitive 
if wowwee fails to retain any of these key personnel  and or fails to hire  train and integrate replacement personnel  it might not be able to maintain and expand its business  and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the loss of any of optimal payments senior officers could adversely affect its relationships with its strategic service providers  which would adversely affect its business 
we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses we acquire into our operations 
our future growth strategy may include acquiring other businesses 
for example  in november we acquired wowwee 
however  we may not be able to identify and acquire suitable target businesses or  to the extent required  obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms 
integrating acquired businesses into our operations may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating an acquisition  the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  the difficulty in integrating widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technologies successfully  the potential impairment of relationships with employees  customers and strategic partners  and the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
customer satisfaction or performance problems at an acquired business could adversely affect the reputation of our entire business 
future acquisitions may be financed through the issuance of common shares  which may dilute the ownership of our shareholders  or through the incurrence of indebtedness 
acquisitions may also result in significant charges to earnings 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that competition for acquisition candidates will not escalate  thereby increasing the costs of making acquisitions or making suitable acquisitions more difficult to find 
we are subject to the risk that a taxation authority could challenge certain filing positions we have taken  and that a successful challenge could require us to pay significant additional taxes 
although we believe that all filing positions we take in our tax returns are reasonable and appropriate  there is no assurance that a taxation authority will not challenge those positions 
such challenges could include disputing positions taken in connection with the transfer of our online gaming processing business to fireone group plc and its affiliates in  and the subsequent public offering of a portion of the fireone group plc ordinary shares 
a challenge to certain filing positions we have taken  if successful  could result in us being required to pay additional taxes including penalties and interest and the amount of such additional taxes could be material to us 
we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
the majority of our revenues are generated in us dollars and a significant portion of our expenses is incurred in canadian dollars 
a fluctuation in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar may result in variations in our revenues  expenses and earnings 
we have not implemented a currency hedging program 
our operating strategy for wowwee might not succeed and the anticipated benefits to us from our acquisition of wowwee might not be realized 
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of the wowwee business will depend  in part  on the successful implementation of specific new strategies designed to enhance the growth and financial performance of the wowwee business 
these include expanding sales and distribution through a broadening of wowwee s sales channels  particularly outside north america in emerging markets  expanding product design  development and production capabilities to produce an increased number of products at varying price points  broadening development initiatives into products that combine computer connectivity  utility and entertainment  embarking on branded entertainment initiatives  licensing  publishing and merchandising  and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
if we fail to succeed in implementing these and other strategies that we might develop  wowwee could fail to grow  we may not realize the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition of the wowwee business  and our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if wowwee does not satisfy consumer preferences our results of operations may be adversely affected 
wowwee competes with a wide range of manufacturers  marketers and sellers of consumer electronics and play products  many of which are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we do 
consumer preferences change 
if its competitors products achieve greater market acceptance than wowwee s products  wowwee s products are unable to satisfy consumer preferences  or wowwee fails to respond to changes in consumer preferences with products that achieve and sustain market acceptance in a timely and cost effective manner  demand for wowwee s products could decrease and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
wowwee s business is seasonal and its annual operating results depend  in large part  upon the relatively brief holiday season in the fourth quarter of the year 
retail sales of wowwee s products are susceptible to seasonal variations  with a majority of sales occurring between september and december 
as a result  wowwee s operating results depend  in large part  upon sales made during this period 
if wowwee achieves less than satisfactory sales  operating earnings or cash flows from operating activities during the september to december period in any fiscal year  we may not be able to compensate sufficiently for the lower sales  operating earnings  or cash flows from operating activities during the first eight months of the fiscal year 
improved inventory management by retailers resulting in shorter lead times for production and possible shipping disruptions during peak demand times may affect the ability of wowwee to deliver its products in time to meet retailer demands 
as retailers attempt to manage their inventories better by requiring suppliers to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell products to consumers  suppliers such as wowwee may have shorter lead times for production  and disruptions in shipping  for any reason  from china during peak demand times may affect the ability of wowwee to deliver its products in time to meet retailer demand 
wowwee s sales are concentrated among a relatively small number of major retailer customers  which exposes wowwee to any financial difficulties or changes in purchasing preferences or policies of these customers 
a small number of major retailer customers account for a large proportion of wowwee s sales 
wowwee s customers make purchases by one time purchase orders  as opposed to making long term purchase commitments 
these customers could reduce their overall purchases of wowwee s products for any reason  including due to financial difficulties  or could reduce the shelf space allotted for such products 
any such change by a major customer of wowwee could significantly harm its business and our results of operations 
consolidation among wowwee s major customers would compound the effect upon us of any financial difficulties suffered by such customers or any changes in the purchasing preferences or policies of such customers 
increased consolidation among its customers could negatively impact the ability of wowwee to negotiate higher sales prices for its products and could result in lower gross profit margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among its customers 
all of wowwee s products are manufactured in china and we are subject to the risk that political developments  including currency revaluation and trade relations between china and the markets in which wowwee s products are sold  could increase the costs of producing and delay or prevent shipping such products 
all of wowwee s products are manufactured by third parties in the people s republic of china 
social and economic conditions in china affecting the movement of products from china to the markets in which wowwee s products are sold  particularly north america  and the labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 
factors that could negatively affect wowwee include a potential revaluation of the chinese yuan  which may increase the cost of producing products in china  increased labor costs and labor disputes that could result in difficulties in transporting products manufactured in china to the ports on the western coast of north america 
also  a negative change in china s trade status with the united states or the european union  including the imposition of trade sanctions  could significantly increase the cost of products imported from china 
any increase in the cost of producing and the cost of  or disruptions in  shipping wowwee s products in and from china could significantly adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction or interruption in the supply of raw materials  parts and components or a significant increase in the price of supplies used to produce wowwee s products could negatively affect wowwee s gross profit margins 
wowwee may from time to time encounter shortages of materials  parts and components from its suppliers or a price increase in such materials  parts and components resulting from their shortage 
price increases for components such as resin used in plastics  rising fuel and transportation costs and raw material prices  may significantly reduce wowwee s gross profit margins and our results of operations 
due to market conditions  timing of pricing decisions  competition and other factors  there can be no assurance that wowwee will be able to offset any of such increased costs by adjusting the prices of its products because increases in the prices of wowwee s products could result in lower sales 
as a developer and supplier of consumer products  wowwee is subject to various government regulations  violation of which could subject us to sanctions 
as a developer and supplier of consumer products  wowwee operates in a highly regulated environment in the united states and international markets 
regulations that apply to its products and their importation include regulation of advertising directed toward children and product safety 
there can be no assurance that wowwee or its products will be in compliance in the future with such regulations 
in addition  changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased compliance related costs in wowwee s business 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could have a negative impact on wowwee  our financial condition and our results of operations 
wowwee could also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall  the costs of which could be significant 
in addition  any product recall  regardless of direct costs of the recall  may harm consumer perceptions of wowwee s products 
wowwee could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls  which could harm wowwee 
products that have been or may be developed by wowwee may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products 
there can be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage  we may not be able to maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims 
moreover  even if we maintain sufficient insurance coverage  any successful claim could significantly harm wowwee  our financial condition and our results of operations 
failure by wowwee to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information could have a material adverse effect on wowwee  our financial condition and results of operations 
the value of wowwee depends to a large degree on its ability to protect its intellectual property and information  including its trademarks  trade names  copyrights and trade secrets 
wowwee s business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting its products or infringing on its intellectual property rights 
any failure by wowwee to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information could have a material adverse effect on wowwee  our financial condition and our results of operations 
optimal payments is at risk of loss due to fraud  disputes and merchant insolvency 
optimal payments faces risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between consumers and merchants  including the unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft  merchant fraud  disputes over the quality of goods and services  breaches of system security  employee fraud and use of its system for illegal or improper purposes 
when a consumer pays a merchant for goods or services using a credit card and the cardholder disputes the charge  the amount of the disputed item gets charged back to optimal payments and the credit card association may levy fees against optimal payments 
chargebacks can arise from the unauthorized use of a cardholder s card number or from a cardholder s claim that a merchant failed to perform a transaction 
disputes can also arise when a consumer pays a merchant for goods or services using a check and the financial institution returns the check 
in addition  if optimal payments chargeback or dispute rate becomes excessive  credit card and check clearing associations may require it to pay fines and have done so in the past 
there is a risk that optimal payments may be required to pay fines in the future and the amount of such fines may be material 
while optimal payments attempts to recover from the merchant the amount charged back and the amount of any fines imposed upon it by credit card and check clearing associations  optimal payments may not always be successful in doing so for various reasons  such as merchant insolvency 
optimal payments may not be able to safeguard against security and privacy breaches in its electronic transactions 
a significant element of electronic commerce and communication is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
optimal payments electronic commerce software uses encryption and authentication technology to securely transmit confidential information 
although optimal payments strives to use only proven applications for premium data security and integrity to process electronic transactions  use of these applications may not be sufficient to address changing market conditions or developments in technology or the security and privacy concerns of optimal payments existing and potential customers 
optimal payments may not be able to prevent security or privacy breaches 
a security or privacy breach could expose optimal payments to liability and to potentially costly litigation  cause optimal payments to incur expenses relating to the remediation of these breaches  and cause optimal payments customers to lose confidence in its services  harm its reputation  and deter customers from using optimal payments services 
although optimal payments requires that its agreements with service providers who have access to merchant and consumer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any consumer or merchant data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements  there can be no assurance that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure of merchant or consumer data 
individuals may attempt to circumvent the measures that optimal payments takes to protect customer transaction data 
security breaches could result in the disclosure of proprietary information  such as bank account or credit card information 
if optimal payments is unable to protect the security and privacy of its electronic transactions and data  it could be exposed to risk of loss  litigation and possible liability  and its business volume  revenues and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
optimal payments payments systems might be used for illegal or improper purposes 
despite its measures to detect and prevent identity theft  unauthorized use of credit cards  and similar misconduct  and to monitor and comply with laws and regulations restricting or prohibiting the processing of certain types of transactions for its merchant customers  optimal payments payments systems are susceptible to illegal or improper uses by third parties 
these uses may include illegal online gaming  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  software and other intellectual property piracy  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud 
illegal or improper use of payments systems may lead to increased government regulation of optimal payments or other legal consequences which may have an adverse impact on its revenues and results of operations 
laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit the business activities of optimal payments merchant customers may prevent optimal payments from providing  or may make it impracticable for it to continue to provide  its payments systems to such merchants and their customers  which would adversely affect its revenues and results of operations 
optimal payments must comply with credit card and check clearing association rules and practices  which could impose additional costs and burdens on its payments business 
optimal payments must comply with the operating rules of the various credit card associations and check clearing associations with which it is registered  such as the national automated clearing house association for checks 
the associations could adopt operating rules with which it may be difficult or impossible for optimal payments to comply 
in addition  cases of fraud or disputes between consumers and merchants can result in chargebacks 
if optimal payments chargebacks or disputes become excessive  its processing suppliers could fine it or terminate its ability to accept credit cards or checks for payments 
the termination of its relationship with credit card or check clearing associations  or acquiring banks  would limit its ability to provide transaction processing services 
optimal payments may not be able to develop new services that are accepted by its customers 
the success of optimal payments operations depends upon acceptance of its electronic payments technology by merchants 
optimal payments may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new services and enhancements  or new services and enhancements may not be introduced in a timely fashion or may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
the failure of optimal payments systems  the systems of third parties or the internet could negatively impact its business and harm its reputation for reliability 
computer viruses  disgruntled or rogue employees  electronic break ins  power losses  telecommunications failures  security breaches  natural disasters and similar events could damage or disrupt the function of optimal payments systems and those of third parties upon whom it relies  such as bank processing and credit card systems  thereby adversely affecting optimal payments business and reputation 
optimal payments insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in these systems 
higher transaction volumes may require optimal payments to expand and upgrade its technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
it could experience periodic  temporary capacity constraints  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times and reduced levels of customer service 
optimal payments may be unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of its services or to expand and upgrade its systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases in a timely manner 
optimal payments has developed a formal disaster recovery plan designed to safeguard against system failures  however  there is no assurance that any disaster recovery plan that it might implement will protect it from all possible system failures 
increasing government regulation of internet commerce could make it more costly or difficult for optimal payments to conduct its business 
as internet commerce continues to grow  it may become the subject of increasing government regulation 
much of the current legislation relating to commercial transactions pre dates and may be incompatible with internet electronic commerce 
well established financial institutions and credit card companies may be able to influence the development of regulations that prioritize their interests to optimal payments detriment 
regulators may choose to enact or enforce legislation that restricts optimal payments operations and other aspects of the electronic commerce market 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet 
existing legislation in canada  the united states and abroad regulates communications and commerce specifically 
however  the application of such laws in the context of the internet and electronic commerce is uncertain 
laws and regulations that address issues such as user privacy  pricing  online content regulation  taxation and the characteristics and quality of online services are under consideration by federal  provincial  state  local and foreign governments and agencies 
new laws or regulations relating to the internet  or applications or interpretations of existing laws  that decrease the growth in the use of the internet or demand for optimal payments electronic commerce services  or that increase the costs associated with providing such services or transmitting data over the internet could adversely affect our results of operations 
if optimal payments relationships with its banking partners deteriorated  its ability to process transactions could be impaired or halted 
optimal payments relies on strategic partnerships and suppliers to help supply  promote and distribute its services 
optimal payments particularly depends upon its strategic banking relationships 
the credit card association members and financial institutions that process electronic transactions have adopted guidelines that apply to online transactions 
while we believe that optimal payments operations comply with these guidelines  credit card association members and financial institutions could nonetheless decide in the future to refuse to process transactions for optimal payments 
such a decision could be implemented with little or no advance notice to optimal payments 
if such a situation occurred and optimal payments were not able to conclude alternative arrangements with other credit card association members or financial institutions  its ability to carry out payment transactions could be impaired or even halted 
it may be difficult or costly for optimal payments to enforce its rights with respect to assets held in foreign jurisdictions 
certain of optimal payments suppliers processing agreements require it to maintain cash reserves with such suppliers 
in some instances  these suppliers are located in overseas jurisdictions  including the caribbean and europe 
if a processing supplier does not release its reserves in accordance with its contractual obligations  optimal payments will be required to take legal action within that foreign jurisdiction 
recovering funds held as reserves through legal action in foreign jurisdictions could be costly and difficult and the diversion of resources required to pursue the funds could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
optimal payments intellectual property rights may be infringed by unauthorized third parties 
optimal payments relies upon a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure and release of interest in intellectual property agreements and license agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its service offerings and technology 
the source codes for optimal payments service offerings and technology are protected both as trade secrets and as unpublished  unregistered copyrighted works 
however  optimal payments currently has no patents for its service offerings and technology 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use optimal payments services or technology without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of its services is and will continue to be difficult  particularly in light of the global nature of optimal payments operations  and the laws of other jurisdictions may offer it little or no effective protection of its intellectual property rights 
optimal payments relies in part on on screen licenses  which are not manually signed by end users and  therefore  may be unenforceable under some laws 
optimal payments may bring litigation proceedings to enforce its intellectual property rights  however  such litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources 
in addition  there is no assurance that optimal payments services are not within the scope of intellectual property rights held by others  either now or in the future 
if a claim is asserted against it by a third party  optimal payments may be forced to seek a license from that third party for the use of the applicable intellectual property 
such a license  if required  may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
optimal payments operates in a competitive market for its services 
potential competitors in optimal payments market include credit card association members  financial institutions  payment processors and other similar entities  some of which may have greater financial resources than we do  more firmly entrenched market positions or greater brand recognition 
these potential competitors may require that their own technology  rather than the technology of third parties such as optimal payments  be used in connection with their payment mechanisms 
competition is likely to intensify as the market develops and matures  which could result in downward pressure on optimal payments prices  reduce its margins and erode its market share 
optimal payments may not be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new services or offer new services that appeal to its customers as fast as its competitors or respond effectively to technological changes or product innovations by its competitors 
if optimal payments fails to anticipate or respond effectively to technological developments and customer requirements or experiences significant delays in product developments or roll outs  it may lose its market share and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
optimal payments relies upon non exclusive arrangements with independent sales agents to acquire and retain its customers 
in addition to its internal sales and marketing efforts  optimal payments relies upon independent sales agents to acquire and retain its customers 
its arrangements with these independent sales agents are non exclusive 
as a result  optimal payments sales agents may enter into arrangements with optimal payments competitors that provide preferential treatment to those competitors or they may terminate their arrangements with optimal payments 
if optimal payments fails to maintain strong relationships with its independent sales agents or fails to provide its independent sales agents with sufficient incentives to motivate their sales efforts  optimal payments customer base may not expand and could decrease 
optimal payments services are based on sophisticated technology  which may be negatively affected by technological defects and product development delays 
services based on sophisticated technology and computing systems  such as optimal payments payment processing services  often encounter development delays  and the underlying technology may contain undetected defects when introduced or when the volume of services provided increases 
optimal payments may experience delays in the development of its transaction processing services or the technology and computing systems underlying its services 
in addition  despite testing  it is possible that optimal payments technology may nevertheless contain errors  and this could delay product launches and innovations and damage its customer relations 
optimal payments business is subject to fluctuations in general business conditions 
the current downturn in general economic conditions has caused some of optimal payments merchant customers to experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans 
if these merchants make fewer sales of their products and services  optimal payments will have fewer transactions to process  resulting in lower revenues 
in addition  in a recessionary environment  the merchants optimal payments serves become subject to a higher risk of insolvency  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
optimal payments bears the credit risk for chargebacks related to billing disputes between credit card holders and merchants 
if a merchant seeks protective relief under bankruptcy laws or is otherwise unable or unwilling to reimburse optimal payments for chargebacks borne by optimal payments  optimal payments may be liable for the full transaction amount of a chargeback 
due to recently enacted legislation in the united states  our formerly majority owned subsidiary  fireone group plc  has ceased processing settlements for online gaming transactions originating from united states customers and  as a result  optimal payments revenues decreased significantly 
optimal payments may not be able to replace the revenues lost from the cessation of this business 
on october   the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of was enacted 
the act prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the internet 
the act also instructs the us treasury department and federal reserve to impose new obligations upon financial institutions and other payment processors to establish procedures designed to block online gaming related financial transactions 
it also expressly requires internet bets and wagers to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the wagers are initiated and received 
upon passage of the act  our then majority owned subsidiary  fireone group plc  ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
the cessation of this portion of our payments processing business had a material adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations from our payments processing business 
optimal payments is actively pursuing strategies to replace the revenues that were lost due to the cessation of processing online gaming transactions originating from us consumers 
however  it may not be able to identify and engage in other opportunities that will offset the loss of these revenues 
the legal status of online gaming is uncertain in some of the jurisdictions in which optimal payments continues to provide settlement processing services for online gaming activities 
future regulation or enforcement proceedings may make it costly or impossible for optimal payments to continue processing transactions for gaming merchants in those jurisdictions and may subject us to substantial penalties 
reports of regulatory initiatives or enforcement proceedings that are unfavorable to optimal payments or to its customers or suppliers may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares 
in many jurisdictions there are few  if any  laws or regulations that deal directly with payment processing for online gaming transactions 
the legal status of online gaming itself is uncertain in many of the jurisdictions in which optimal payments operates 
while some jurisdictions have taken the position that online gaming is legal and have adopted or are in the process of reviewing legislation to regulate online gaming  other jurisdictions have taken the opposite view and enacted legislation to attempt to restrict or prohibit online gaming 
for example  the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the internet  which resulted in our then majority owned subsidiary  fireone group plc  ceasing to process settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
if other governments also decide to enact legislation restricting or prohibiting online gaming activities in their jurisdictions  optimal payments may also have to cease processing settlement transactions in those jurisdictions 
in addition  we may be exposed to adverse consequences as a result of future enforcement proceedings  governmental investigations or lawsuits initiated against optimal payments in jurisdictions where online gaming is or becomes restricted or prohibited  including the united states in the aftermath of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of any adverse findings  rulings or judgments rendered against optimal payments could involve substantial penalties  fines  injunctions or other sanctions being invoked against it and could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues  operating results and financial condition 
any future enforcement or legal proceedings threatened or commenced against optimal payments relating to online gaming  whether or not ultimately successful  could involve substantial litigation expense and the diversion of the attention of key executives 
the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted 
future regulation  lawsuits  investigations  enforcement actions or other similar actions by law enforcement or regulatory authorities  whether directed against optimal payments  its competitors  customers or suppliers  may also make it costly or unfeasible for optimal payments to continue processing transactions for gaming merchants in the jurisdictions in which it continues such processing activities 
further  any actual or threatened legislative development or regulatory proceedings in those jurisdictions that negatively affects a participant in the online gaming industry could further adversely affect the trading price of our common shares 
from time to time  reports about regulatory initiatives  or enforcement proceedings that are or would be unfavorable to us  or to optimal payments customers or suppliers  have had a swift and negative impact on the trading price of our common shares  and our common shares may again experience trading price volatility in the future due to such reports 
optimal payments status under certain financial services regulations is unclear 
optimal payments operates in an industry subject to government regulation 
optimal payments currently is subject to money laundering regulations and might now or in the future be subject to money transmitter or electronic money regulations in various jurisdictions 
if optimal payments is found to be in violation of any current or future regulations  it could be exposed to financial liability  including substantial fines which could be imposed on a per transaction basis and disgorgement of our profits  forced to change its business practices  or forced to cease doing business altogether or with the residents of one or more jurisdictions 
we have a material amount of goodwill which  if it becomes impaired  would result in a reduction in our net income 
goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire 
current accounting standards require that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit 
we tested optimal payments for impairment at december  and revised our forecast to reflect higher merchant attrition and lower growth expectations for this business segment 
as a result  a goodwill impairment loss of approximately million was recognized in this business segment 
after recording this impairment loss  at december   approximately million  or  of our total assets represented goodwill 
any further declines in our assessment of the fair value of optimal payments and any decline in our assessment of the fair value of wowwee may impact the carrying value of these two business segments  which could result in a further write down of our goodwill and a reduction in our net income 
we may be subject to additional litigation stemming from our operation of the u scan self checkout business 
in  we settled an action alleging that the u scan self checkout systems that we marketed infringed upon the claimant s patent 
in  and  a second party sent demand letters to us alleging a different patent infringement 
we may in the future be subject to other litigation relating to our prior involvement in the self checkout business 
defending against such litigation may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our current businesses  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

after consultation with counsel  we believe that there is no basis for these claims and intend to vigorously defend our position 
management is unable to determine the resolution of this matter or estimate the ultimate liability  if any  related thereto 
we are also party to litigation arising in the normal course of operations 
we do not expect the resolution of such matters to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

our industry segments we operated in two segments during wowwee and optimal payments see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
wowwee based in hong kong  with offices in la jolla  california and montreal  quebec  wowwee designs  develops  markets and distributes technology based  consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products that can be sold at a variety of price points 
for  wowwee s product offering encompasses four distinct lines wowwee robotics  wowwee flytech  wowwee alive and wowwee technologies

online sales of wowwee s products are also made through internet based e tailers such as amazon and buy 
com 
wowwee s products are produced in china by third party manufacturers with which wowwee has long standing relationships 
consistent with industry practice  the use of third party manufacturers allows wowwee to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs  while improving flexibility  capacity and production technology 
by outsourcing its manufacturing process  wowwee maintains a flexible business model that enables it to be responsive to changing technology 
in addition  once a product has reached its commercialization phase  wowwee is able to minimize inventory risk by manufacturing products based upon actual customer orders 
upon final assembly  products can be shipped directly from the manufacturing locations to retailers and distributors  with title to the products passing to retailer customers in china 
although wowwee does not conduct the day to day manufacturing of its products  it is extensively involved in the design of the product prototype and production tools  dies and moulds for its products and seeks to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the production process and testing the products produced by its manufacturers 
wowwee employs quality control inspectors who rotate among its manufacturers factories to monitor the production of substantially all of its products 
wowwee s quality assurance personnel advise as to compliance with applicable regulations during each phase of product development  and perform compliance testing  and coordinate third party independent compliance testing  on all wowwee products 
once pre production testing has been completed and product production has been approved  wowwee s quality assurance personnel monitor production at the manufacturer s facility for compliance with wowwee s quality requirements

the majority of orders are traditionally written during the first two quarters of the year  with shipments occurring throughout the year as new product becomes available 
the majority of product shipments occur during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii products are shipped to customers who assume risk of loss  iii collection of the respective receivable is probable and iv sales price is fixed or determinable 
accruals for customer discounts  rebates  incentives and allowances are recorded when the related revenues are recognized 
wowwee s person engineering and design team develops new technologies using internal capabilities and seeks to identify emerging or underutilized innovations that are currently being developed or that are available in the marketplace 
in order to leverage the man hours invested in prior products  older generations of products frequently form the foundation for the next generation of products as well as new product lines 
new technologies are then integrated to enhance the overall functionality of the product 
in sourcing technologies  wowwee reviews the latest technology innovations at trade shows  conferences  colleges and universities  on the internet  and through word of mouth 
wowwee regularly reviews technologies or product concepts from third party sources that it believes could have potential synergies with wowwee s current product line or that could be successfully commercialized based upon wowwee s development process 
wowwee also licenses third party technologies for development within unique consumer applications developed by wowwee 
optimal payments optimal payments provides technology and services that businesses require to accept credit card  electronic check and direct debit payments 
optimal payments processes credit card payments for card not present and card present transactions  including internet businesses  mail order telephone order merchants  and retail point of sale merchants 
optimal payments also processes checks and direct debits online and by telephone 
optimal payments generates revenues primarily from fees charged to merchants for processing services 
fees charged to merchants typically include a discount rate  based upon a percentage of the dollar amounts processed  and a variety of fixed transaction fees 
merchant fees charged are based upon the merchant s transaction volume and risk profile 
generally  higher discount rates are charged for card not present transactions than for card present transactions in order to compensate for the higher cost of underwriting and managing the increased chargeback risk associated with these transactions 
other fees are derived from a variety of fixed transaction fees  including fees for monthly minimum charge volume requirements  statement fees  annual fees and fees for other miscellaneous items  such as handling chargebacks 
revenue is recognized primarily at the time the transaction is performed 
where optimal payments is the primary party responsible for providing processing services  revenue is recorded on a gross basis and amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier are recorded as part of our transaction processing expenses 
where optimal payments is not the primary party in providing a merchant with processing services  we record revenue net of amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier see note m of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
disputes between a customer and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  consumer dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not always be resolved in the merchant s favor 
if a dispute is not resolved in the merchant s favor  the transaction is charged back to optimal payments and the purchase price is refunded to the merchant s customer 
if optimal payments is unable to collect the amount charged back from the merchant  it bears the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction 
as a result  optimal payments acquiring processing suppliers require it to maintain certain amounts with them as reserves 
amounts withheld from optimal payments by its acquiring processing suppliers as reserves are included as current assets on our balance sheet under held as reserves 
optimal payments retains a percentage of amounts owed to certain merchants based on processing dollar volume  typically for a six month period  to absorb potential losses arising as a result of  among other things  disputes between consumers and merchants or credit card or check clearing association fines related to chargeback activity 
these reserves comprise specifically identifiable reserves for merchant transactions for which losses can be estimated and an estimate of loss in the remaining portfolio based on experience 
the aggregate amount withheld is referred to as held as reserves and the amount that optimal payments must eventually pay its customers in respect of remaining reserves is recorded under the line item customer reserves and security deposits on the balance sheet contained in our consolidated financial statements 
significant developments in our business in on november   we acquired substantially all of the assets of wowwee limited  a privately held hong kong based designer  developer  marketer and distributor of technology based  consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products  as well as substantially all of the assets of wowwee marketing  inc  with offices in california  and wowwee group company  with offices in canada 
wowwee marketing and wowwee group were service providers to wowwee limited in the operation of its business 
we believe that our acquisition will provide the wowwee business with greater financial and operational resources to grow both in north america and internationally  and to build upon the existing consumer focused franchise of the business  by capitalizing on its corporate brands through the development of a cross platform entertainment media strategy 
the total purchase price we paid for the wowwee business was  consisting of cash consideration of  the issuance of  common shares with a fair value of  and a warrant to purchase  common shares having an estimated fair value  the warrant has an exercise price of per share and is exercisable for a period of years 
our transaction costs in connection with this transaction were approximately  following announcements by the us attorney s office in the southern district of new york relating to its investigation of the us internet gambling industry  we announced on may  that we had initiated discussions with the us attorney s office in the southern district of new york and are in the process of responding to a voluntary request for information issued by the us attorney s office 
in connection with such ongoing investigation  we announced on may  that we had received a copy of warrants of seizure issued by the us attorney s office against funds of certain payment processors that were on deposit with two us banks 
these funds included million that were on deposit to the credit of affiliates of ours 
the total amount seized of million is presented as long term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have not recorded any provision for this matter in our consolidated financial statements because the outcome of these discussions and the amount of loss  if any  is not determinable 
on february   optimal acquisition inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of opil held by non controlling shareholders  which as of that date became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
effective february   a non controlling interest is no longer recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
our transaction costs in connection with this transaction were million 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method 
we recorded goodwill of million in connection with this transaction 
seasonality revenue derived from the optimal payments business segment is currently not subject to seasonality 
revenue from wowwee business segment is subject to seasonal variability with a significant portion of revenues generated in the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian gaap  which requires us to make numerous estimates and assumptions 
financial results as determined by actual events could differ from those estimates and assumptions  and therefore affect our reported results of operations and financial position 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements also involves significant management judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while best estimates have been used for reporting financial statement items subject to measurement uncertainty  management considers that it is possible  based on existing knowledge  that changes in future conditions in the near term could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
near term is considered to be within one year from the date of the financial statements 
stock based compensation we use the fair value based method to account for stock based compensation and other stock based payments  such as stock options and restricted share units 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the award s vesting period 
the fair value of stock options granted is determined at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain assumptions  including future stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  and expected time to exercise 
changes to any of these assumptions  or the use of a different option pricing model  would result in different fair values for stock based compensation 
reserve for losses on merchant accounts when a consumer pays a merchant for goods or services online and the consumer subsequently disputes the online transaction  the amount of the disputed item gets charged back to optimal payments and the credit card or clearing bank association may levy a fee against it 
in addition  if optimal payments chargeback rate becomes excessive  the associations can also require it to pay fines 
in turn  optimal payments attempts to recover from the merchant the amount charged back and the amount of such fines 
however  it may not always be successful in doing so  for reasons which could include merchant insolvency 
we evaluate the risk associated with merchants and consumers and estimate our loss based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors 
goodwill and other intangibles we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method 
accordingly  the purchase price of a business acquisition is allocated to its identifiable net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  on the basis of estimated fair values as at the date of purchase  with any excess being assigned to goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition using a projected discounted cash flow method and other valuation methods 
we make a number of significant estimates when calculating fair value using a projected discounted cash flow method 
these estimates include estimating projected future cash flows  the number of years used  the discount rate and others 
we believe that our estimates and valuation methods are reasonable 
they are consistent with our inherent planning and reflect our best estimates  but they have inherent uncertainties that management may not be able to control 
goodwill is not amortized but rather evaluated under an impairment approach 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the amounts recorded as intangible assets at the date of acquisition represent the estimated fair value of these assets based on estimated future cash flows discounted at appropriate discount rates 
in addition  in our assessment of impairment  we are required to determine the fair value of the businesses from which the goodwill and intangibles originated 
for intangibles with finite lives  we make estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the related assets 
income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method of tax allocation 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable temporary differences between financial statement values and tax values of assets and liabilities using substantively enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance against future income tax assets if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that some or all of the future income tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the reliability of tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the future tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we considered the scheduled reversal of tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
contingent liabilities our former gaming payment processing services segment derived a substantial portion of its revenue prior to october  from processing transactions from us based gaming 
therefore  we may be exposed to adverse consequences as a result of enforcement proceedings  governmental investigations or lawsuits initiated against us in jurisdictions where gaming is or becomes restricted or prohibited 
following announcements by the us attorney s office in the southern district of new york relating to its investigation of the us internet gambling industry  we announced on may  that we had initiated discussions with the us attorney s office in the southern district of new york and are in the process of responding to a voluntary request for information issued by the us attorney s office 
we have not recorded any provision for this matter because the outcome of these discussions and the amount of loss  if any  are not determinable 
while best estimates have been used for reporting financial statement items subject to measurement uncertainty  management considers that it is possible that changes in future conditions in the near term could require a material change in the recognized amounts of certain assets and liabilities 
near term is considered to be within one year from the date of the financial statements 
we are also party to litigation arising in the normal course of operations 
the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should we fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several legal matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period  the consolidated operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
recent accounting pronouncements a new accounting policies the following accounting standards have recently been issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica  and the financial accounting standard board fasb that are relevant to our company 
effective january   we adopted the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica handbook section  comprehensive income  cica handbook section  equity  cica handbook section  financial instruments recognition and measurement  cica handbook section  financial instruments disclosure and presentation  and cica handbook section  hedges 
sections  and provide comprehensive requirements for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments  as well as standards on when and how hedge accounting may be applied 
handbook section establishes standards for the presentation of equity and change in equity during the reporting period and requires us to present separately equity components and changes in equity arising from i net earnings  ii other comprehensive income  iii other changes in retained earnings  iv changes in contributed surplus and v changes in share capital 
a new consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity is presented in our consolidated financial statements 
handbook section also establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity from transactions and other events from non owner sources 
other comprehensive income refers to items recognized in comprehensive income but that are excluded from net income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under these new standards  all financial instruments are classified into one of the following five categories held for trading  held to maturity investments  loans and receivables  available for sale financial assets or other financial liabilities 
upon initial recognition  all financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value 
subsequent to initial recognition  all financial instruments  including derivatives  are included in the consolidated balance sheet and are measured at fair market value with the exception of loans and receivables  held to maturity investments and other financial liabilities  which will be measured at amortized cost 
subsequent measurement and recognition of changes in fair value of financial instruments depend on their initial classification 
held for trading financial investments are measured at fair value and all gains and losses are included in net income in the period in which they arise 
available for sale financial instruments are measured at fair value with revaluation gains and losses included in other comprehensive income until the asset is removed from the balance sheet 
the standards require derivative instruments to be recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value unless exempted from derivative treatment as a normal purchase and sale 
certain derivatives embedded in other contracts must also be measured at fair value 
all changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met  which requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we chose to review all contracts in place on january  that were entered into after january   for any embedded derivatives needed to be accounted for separately at fair value from the base contract 
as a result of the adoption of these standards  we have classified our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash and short term investments held as reserves  and restricted cash as available for sale 
we have classified our accounts receivable and settlement assets as loans and receivables  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and customer reserves and security deposits as other financial liabilities  all of which are measured at amortized cost 
the adoption of these new standards also resulted in the reclassification of the amount of  previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
the adoption of these standards had no impact on the consolidated statement of earnings 
b future accounting pronouncements the following accounting pronouncements have recently been issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica  and the financial accounting standard board fasb that may be relevant to our company 
section  capital disclosures  established guidelines for disclosure of both qualitative and quantitative information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the entity s objectives  policies and processes for managing capital 
this new standard relates to disclosure only and will not impact our financial results 
this standard is effective january  section  financial instruments disclosure  describes the required disclosure for the assessment of the significance of financial instruments for an entity s financial position and performance and of the nature and extent of risk arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed and how the entity manages those risks 
section  financial instruments presentation  establishes standards for presentation of financial instruments and non financial derivatives 
it carries forward the presentation related requirements of section  financial instruments disclosure and presentation 
these new standards relate to disclosure only and will not impact our financial results 
these standards are effective january  in june  cica issued section  inventories  which replaces section and harmonizes the canadian standards related to inventories with ifrs 
this section provides changes to the measurement and more extensive guidance on the determination of cost  including allocation of overhead  narrows the permitted cost formulas  requires impairment testing  and expands the disclosure requirements to increase transparency 
this section applies to interim and annual financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or after january  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in  the accounting standards board of canada acsb announced that accounting standards in canada are to converge with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
in may  the cica published an updated version of its implementation plan for incorporating international financial reporting standards into canadian gaap 
this plan includes an outline of the key decisions that the cica needs to make as it implements the strategic plan for publicly accountable enterprises that will converge canadian generally accepted accounting standards with ifrs 
while ifrs uses a conceptual framework similar to canadian gaap  there are significant differences in accounting standards which must be addressed 
these standards are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january  sfas no 
r  business combinations in december  the fasb issued a revised standard on accounting for business combinations 
the major changes to accounting for business combinations include the following all business acquisitions would be measured at fair value  the existing definition of a business would be expanded  certain pre acquisition contingencies would be measured at fair value  most acquisition related costs would be recognized as expenses as incurred they would no longer be part of the purchase consideration  obligations for contingent consideration would be measured and recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition measurement and recognition would no longer be dependent on settlement of the contingency  non controlling interests would be measured at fair value at the date of acquisition ie  of the assets and liabilities would be measured at fair value even when an acquisition is less than  goodwill  if any  arising on a business combination reflects the excess of the fair value of the acquiree  as a whole  over the net amount of the recognized identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and would be allocated to the acquirer and the non controlling interest 
the statement is effective for periods beginning on or after january  we will apply the standard for acquisitions occurring after this date 
sfas no 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities this statement permits entities the option to measure financial instruments at fair value fair value option thereby achieving an offsetting effect for accounting purposes for certain changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply hedge accounting 
the fair value option is applied on an instrument by instrument basis to the entire instrument 
items eligible for the fair value option are measured at fair value at specified election dates 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements in december  the fasb issued a revised standard on accounting for non controlling interests and transactions with non controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements 
this statement specifies that non controlling interests are to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other items outside of equity 
because non controlling interests are an element of equity  increases and decreases in the parent s ownership interest that leave control intact are accounted for as capital transactions rather than as a step acquisition or dilution gains or losses 
the carrying amount of the non controlling interests is adjusted to reflect the changes in ownership interests  and any difference between the amount by which the non controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity attributable to the controlling interest 
this standard requires net income and comprehensive income to be displayed for both the controlling and the non controlling interests 
additional required disclosures and reconciliations include a separate schedule that shows the effects of any transactions with the non controlling interests on the equity attributable to the controlling interest 
the statement is effective for periods beginning on or after december  sfas will be applied prospectively to all non controlling interests  including any that arose before the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
financial condition as at december   cash and cash equivalents  cash held as reserves  short term investments  short term investments held as reserves and settlement assets totaled million including million held as reserves  compared to million as at december  including million held as reserves 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments is primarily due to the acquisition of the wowwee business  the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of opil held by non controlling shareholders  the reduction of customer reserves  the seizure of cash by the us attorney s office in connection with its ongoing investigation of the us internet gambling industry see significant developments in our business in presented as long term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet  the repayment of bank indebtedness  a decrease in cash generated from operations  and the purchase of capital assets 
as described above  a significant portion of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments have a corresponding liability as these cash amounts are derived from reserves and security deposits which are due to customers see our industry segments optimal payments

accounts receivable as at december  were million compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted primarily from the acquisition of wowwee 
goodwill increased by million  from million as at december  to million as at december  this increase is due primarily to the acquisition of wowwee  the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of opil held by non controlling shareholders  offset by an impairment loss recorded for optimal payments in intangible assets increased by million  from million as at december  to million as at december  this increase is due primarily to the acquisition of wowwee 
customer reserves and security deposits as at december  were million compared to million as at december  this decrease is due mainly to a reduction in transaction processing volume resulting from the enactment of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of shareholders equity as at december  was million as compared to million as at december  the decrease is attributable primarily to our net loss for the period  offset by the issuance of shares and warrants upon the acquisition of wowwee 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain summarized unaudited quarterly financial data for the periods presented 
the financial data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly data 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
the unaudited financial statements are prepared on the basis of canadian gaap  which is different in some regards from us gaap 
the following quarterly results are adjusted to present the results of operations of our hardware maintenance and repair services business as discontinued operations 
upon the passage of the act on october   opil immediately ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming  which accounted for approximately of revenues of the gaming payment processing services segment for the year ended december  since the passage of the act  our revenues and profitability have been adversely affected and we expect that this will continue for at least the short term

on november  the company completed the acquisition of wowwee  a privately held hong kong based designer  developer  marketer and distributor of technology based consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products 
the results of wowwee were consolidated with those of the company from the date of acquisition 
in and  wowwee s revenues were approximately million and million  respectively  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization were approximately million and million  respectively 
the results of wowwee are subject to seasonal variability with a significant portion of revenues generated in the third and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
compared with revenues decreased by million from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was due primarily to the cessation  in october  of the us based gaming portion of opil s payment processing business 
the decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of wowwee in november optimal payments generated million of revenue in and wowwee represented million of our revenue since the november acquisition  which was after the peak selling season 
over of wowwee s revenues are generated in the third and fourth quarters 
transaction processing and cost of sales decreased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the decrease in transaction processing costs was due primarily to the cessation  in october of the us based gaming portion of opil s payment processing business  partially offset by higher cost of sales beginning after our acquisition of wowwee in november amortization of intangibles pertaining to transaction processing costs and cost of sales increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in amortization is due primarily to the intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of wowwee in november selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to the cessation in october of the us based gaming portion of opil s payment processing business 
approximately million of these expenses are attributed to wowwee 
the stock based compensation pertaining to selling  general and administrative expense is attributable to the accounting for the fair value of stock options and restricted share units granted 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  increased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of opil held by non controlling shareholders in february  all of the unvested restricted share units became exercisable and the remaining unamortized compensation cost of million was recognized in research and development expense remained constant at approximately million during the years ended december  and research and development expenses are comprised primarily of personnel related expenditures associated with the development of new solutions and the enhancement of existing optimal payments offerings 
operating lease expenses decreased by million from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   as a result of prior restructuring 
restructuring costs of million were incurred during the year ended december  these costs related primarily to employee termination benefits and costs of leased premises no longer utilized  as a result of a restructuring of our operations and cost base undertaken following the enactment of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of there were no restructuring costs in amortization of property and equipment increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   principally due to the addition of capital assets as a result of the wowwee acquisition 
we tested optimal payments goodwill for impairment at december  we revised our forecast for the next five years to reflect higher merchant attrition and lower growth expectations for this segment 
at december   a goodwill impairment loss of million was recognized in optimal payments 
the impairment loss represents the estimated amount by which the carrying amount of this asset exceeded its fair value 
the fair value was determined using discounted cash flow projections prepared by management 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in  after taking into consideration items not deductible for tax  our effective tax rate was closer to the canadian combined federal and provincial rate than in  since earnings from the foreign jurisdictions declined as a result of the enactment of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of in  a significant portion of our earnings were generated in a foreign jurisdiction with an effective tax rate significantly lower than the canadian combined federal and provincial rate 
significant components of our tax provision include the effect of the goodwill impairment loss in the amount of million and of stock based compensation in the amount of million  which are not deductible for tax 
as a result of the goodwill impairment loss  we also amortized million of the other asset as a future tax expense 
other significant components of our provision are the change in the valuation allowance of million  which reflects an increase in the benefit of losses not recorded  and an increase of million caused by a decrease in canadian future tax rates 
significant components of our tax provision included the differences in tax rates of foreign jurisdictions of million and the effect of the recognition of previously unrecognized tax assets of million 
our tax provision includes the effect of future taxes on unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses  which arise upon the conversion into canadian dollars of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars for purposes of determining taxable income under canadian income tax regulations 
since the us dollar is our measurement currency and our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars  these foreign exchange gains losses do not impact earnings before income taxes 
in  our tax provision includes a future tax recovery of million related to unrealized foreign exchange compared to a recovery of million in with respect to future income tax assets  as at december  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million million related to assets that we determined were not more likely than not to be realized 
our ability to ultimately realize these future income tax assets is dependent upon our future profitability within the allowable carry forward period  thus creating sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of these assets 
our net loss in was million or per share basic and diluted  compared to net earnings of million per share basic and per share diluted in ebitda was million or per diluted share for compared to ebitda of million or per diluted share for a reconciliation of this non gaap financial information is presented in the table below 
we use non gaap measures to assess our operating performance 
securities regulations require that companies caution readers that earning and other measures adjusted to a basis other than gaap do not have standardized meanings and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
accordingly  they should not be considered in isolation 
we use ebitda to measure our performance from one period to the next without the variation caused by certain adjustments that could potentially distort the analysis of trends in our operating performance  and because we believe it provides meaningful information on our financial condition and operating results 
ebitda  as we use it  is calculated as earnings before investment income  taxes and depreciation and amortization and excludes the impacts of impairment loss  non controlling interest  stock based compensation and discontinued operations 
we believe it is useful to exclude these items as they are either non cash expenses  items that cannot be influenced by management in the short term  or items that do not impact core operating performance 
excluding these items does not imply they are necessarily non recurring

amortization of intangibles pertaining to transaction processing cost of sales increased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in amortization is due primarily to the intangible assets acquired through the business acquisitions described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from the business acquisitions described above 
stock based compensation pertaining to selling  general and administrative expense is attributable to the accounting for the fair value of stock options and restricted share units granted 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation results primarily from our decision taken on november  to accelerate the vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding under our stock option plan and the concurrent decision of fireone group plc to accelerate the vesting of all unvested restricted share units outstanding under its restricted share unit plan 
the stock based compensation for is associated with the issuance of additional stock options under our stock option plan  and the issuance of additional restricted share units by fireone group plc under its restricted share unit plan

we use non gaap measures to assess our operating performance 
securities regulations require that companies caution readers that earning and other measures adjusted to a basis other than gaap do not have standardized meanings and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
accordingly  they should not be considered in isolation 
we use ebitda to measure our performance from one period to the next without the variation caused by certain adjustments that could potentially distort the analysis of trends in our operating performance  and because we believe it provides meaningful information on our financial condition and operating results 
ebitda  as we use it  is calculated as earnings before investment income  taxes and depreciation and amortization and excludes the impacts of impairment loss  non controlling interest  stock based compensation and discontinued operations 
we believe it is useful to exclude these items as they are either non cash expenses  items that cannot be influenced by management in the short term  or items that do not impact core operating performance 
excluding these items does not imply they are necessarily non recurring

operating activities used million of cash and cash equivalents in  as compared to generating million in this decrease is due mainly to a reduction in cash generated from operations  and increased use of cash from operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities is due mainly to the seizure of cash by the us attorney s office  partially offset by reduced payments made out regarding customer reserves and security deposits

interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity table december  carrying fair value value thousands of us dollars notes denominated in us dollars  with a weighted average effective yield of  maturing between march  and april  held as reserves notes denominated in us dollars  with a weighted average effective yield of  maturing on january  total fair value has been determined based upon quoted market values as at december  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from certain expenses paid from canadian operations in canadian dollars  while a significant portion of our revenues are earned in us dollars 
if the canadian dollar strengthens in relation to the us dollar  the effective cost of our expenses as reported in us dollars will increase 
we have never tried to hedge our exchange rate risk  do not plan to do so and may not be successful should we attempt to do so in the future 
we are also exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk  which we do not systematically manage
