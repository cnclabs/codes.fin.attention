item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the principal objective of this discussion is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the company during the year ended december  and the preceding two years 
this discussion and the tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
income 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the credit provision for loan losses  service charges on deposits  financial services group fees and commissions  mortgage banking revenues  gain or loss on the sale of securities  gain or loss on sale of loans and other miscellaneous income 
expenses 
the company s expenses primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  supplies and postage  amortization of other intangible assets  computer and data processing  professional fees and services  advertising and promotions and other miscellaneous expense and income tax expense benefit 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities 
overview net income was million per diluted share  million per diluted share and million per diluted share for  and  respectively 
the return on average common equity in was  compared to in and in the return on average assets in was  compared to in and in net interest income  the principal source of the company s earnings  was million in  down from million in and million in net interest margin was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decline in net interest income resulted from lower earning asset levels along with a narrowed net interest margin 
the flat to inverted interest rate yield curve  which prevailed throughout the first half of  contributed to a reduced spread on asset transactions and caused nonpublic deposits to shift into higher cost certificates of deposits from lower cost deposit products in comparison to the prior years 
effective december   the company merged its subsidiary banks into the new york state chartered first tier bank trust  which was then renamed five star bank fsb 
the consolidation activities improved operational efficiencies and resulted in lower noninterest expense in the company continued to focus on cost reduction initiatives  which resulted in further reductions in noninterest expense in versus over the past several years  the company has executed its strategic plan  which includes a renewed focus on its core community banking business 
as a result  the company sold the burke group  inc subsidiary in  therefore its results have been reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and the loss on discontinued operations  net of tax  was million in in addition  the company sold its trust relationships during and recognized a million gain on the sale 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  which are those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other 
table of contents financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are reported in the consolidated financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill require particularly subjective or complex judgments important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts of principal and interest under the original terms of the agreement or the loan is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring 
accordingly  the company evaluates impaired commercial and agricultural loans individually based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the net realizable value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the majority of the company s impaired loans are collateral dependent 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as nonaccruing if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well collateralized and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as nonaccruing if repayment in full of principal and or interest is uncertain 
for additional discussion related to the company s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses  see the sections titled analysis of allowance for loan losses and allocation of allowance for loan losses in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas no 
discontinue the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
instead  these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review  and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence 
changes in the estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
during  and  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis and determined no impairment existed 
for additional discussion related to the company s accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plan management is required to make various assumptions in valuing its defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the weighted average discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the rate of compensation increase 
the company uses a third party specialist to assist in making these estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity

the deteriorating credit quality of assets linked to the sub prime mortgage market  caused by a decline in general mortgage credit standards  has led to a lack of liquidity and downgrades to certain mbs and other securities in the financial marketplace 
this  in turn  has contributed to a broad based liquidity shortfall in the financial system 
the subsequent increase in risk aversion has contributed to a decline in credit availability in the financial and capital markets 
a continuation of these credit and liquidity issues may result in reduced liquidity and impairment write downs on some of our asset holdings 
mbs and auction rate preferred equity securities are most affected by and are at most risk for possible future reduced liquidity and impairment write downs

the unrealized losses present do not reflect deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuing securities and resulted primarily from fluctuations in market interest rates

the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to ongoing management review 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

and the remaining portfolios of commercial  commercial real estate  and agricultural loans are segmented into the following loan classification categories uncriticized or pass  special mention  and substandard 
uncriticized loans  special mention loans and all substandard loans not assigned a specific loss allowance are assigned allowance allocations based on historical net loan charge off experience for each of the respective loan categories  supplemented with additional reserve amounts  if considered necessary  based upon qualitative factors 
these qualitative factors include the levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccruing loans  and risk ratings  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  and concentrations of credit  among others

this represents a increase in the quarterly common stock dividend compared with the per share dividend in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources liquidity the objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure the ability of the company to meet its financial obligations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
the company achieves liquidity by maintaining a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  its ability to sell securities  lines of credit  and access to the financial and capital markets 
liquidity for the bank is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  the investment portfolio  core deposits and wholesale funds 
the strength of the bank s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include credit lines with the other banking institutions  the fhlb and the federal reserve bank 

table of contents the primary sources of liquidity for fii are dividends from the bank and access to financial and capital markets 
dividends from the bank are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and earnings trends 
the bank relies on cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings and short term liquid assets 
fsis relies on cash flows from operations and funds from fii when necessary 
the deteriorating credit quality of assets linked to the sub prime mortgage market  caused by a decline in general mortgage credit standards  has led to a lack of liquidity and downgrades to certain mbs and other securities in the financial marketplace 
this  in turn  has contributed to a broad based liquidity shortfall in the financial system 
the subsequent increase in risk aversion has contributed to a decline in credit availability in the financial and capital markets 
a continuation of these credit and liquidity issues may result in reduced liquidity and impairment write downs on some of our asset holdings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk to the company given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by fii s board of directors 
the company s management is responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
management has developed an asset liability policy that meets strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the bank 
net interest income at risk analysis the primary tool the company uses to manage interest rate risk is a rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and economic value of equity 
the following table sets forth the results of the modeling analysis as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates in basis points net interest income economic value of equity rate shock amount change change amount change change static the company measures net interest income at risk by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of different magnitudes over a period of months 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would increase net interest income by  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would decrease net interest income by million  or  over a twelve month period 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would decrease the economic value of equity by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would decrease the economic value of equity by million  or  over a twelve month period 
this simulation is based on management s assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve 
it also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates 
further  it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates  it is not a forecast of the future results and is based on many assumptions that  if changed  could cause a different outcome 
in addition to the changes in interest rate scenarios listed above  the company typically runs other scenarios to measure interest rate risk  which vary depending on the economic and interest rate environments 

table of contents gap analysis the following table the gap table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding as of december  which management anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the re pricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected re pricing of assets and liabilities on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
all non maturity deposits demand deposits and savings deposits are subject to immediate withdrawal and are therefore shown to re price in the period of less than days 
prepayment and re pricing rates can have a significant impact on the estimated gap 
the results shown are based on numerous assumptions and there can be no assurance that the presented results will approximate actual future activity

amounts are net of unearned income and net deferred fees and costs

for purposes of interest rate risk management  the company directs more attention on simulation modeling  such as net interest income at risk as previously discussed  rather than gap analysis 
the net interest income at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk
