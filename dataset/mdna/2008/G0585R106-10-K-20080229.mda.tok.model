executive summary assured guaranty ltd 
is a bermuda based holding company which provides  through its operating subsidiaries  credit enhancement products to the public finance  structured finance and mortgage markets 
we apply our credit expertise  risk management skills and capital markets experience to develop insurance  reinsurance and credit derivative products that meet the credit enhancement needs of our customers 
we market our products directly and through financial institutions 
we serve the us and international markets 
in july  the company s direct financial guaranty subsidiaries  assured guaranty corp 
agc and assured guaranty uk ltd  received a financial strength rating of aaa stable from moody s investor services 
the company continues to be rated aaa stable by standard poor s inc and fitch ratings 
this has resulted in increased market share in the us public finance market  and consequently an increase in gross written premiums 
on december   the company completed the sale of  of its common shares at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the sale totaled approximately million 
the company has contributed the net proceeds of the offering to its reinsurance subsidiary  assured guaranty re ltd 
ag re 
ag re has used the proceeds to provide capital support in the form of a reinsurance portfolio transaction with ambac assurance corp 
for approximately billion of net par outstanding  as well as to support the growth of agc  the company s direct financial guaranty subsidiary  by providing reinsurance 
ag re is agc s principal financial guaranty reinsurer 
the financial guaranty industry  along with many other financial institutions  continues to be threatened by deterioration of the credit performance of securities collateralized by us residential mortgages 
there is significant uncertainty surrounding general economic factors  including interest rates and housing prices  which may adversely affect our loss experience 
the company continues to monitor these exposures and update our loss estimates as new information is received 
additionally  scrutiny from state and federal regulatory agencies could result in changes that limit our business 
our financial results include four principal business segments financial guaranty direct  financial guaranty reinsurance  mortgage guaranty and other 
the other segment represents lines of business that we exited or sold as part of our initial public offering ipo 
we derive our revenues principally from premiums from our insurance  reinsurance and credit derivative businesses  net investment income  net realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio and unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments 
our premiums are a function of the amount and type of contracts we write as well as prevailing market prices 
we receive premiums on an upfront basis when the policy is issued or the contract is executed and or on an installment basis over the life of the applicable transaction 
investment income is a function of invested assets and the yield that we earn on those assets 
the investment yield is a function of market interest rates at the time of investment as well as the type  credit quality and maturity of our invested assets 
in addition  we could realize capital losses on securities in our investment portfolio from other than temporary declines in market value as a result of changing market conditions  including changes in market interest rates  and changes in the credit quality of our invested assets 
unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are a function of changes in the estimated fair value of our credit derivative contracts 
we enter into credit derivative contracts which require us to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
we expect these unrealized gains and losses to fluctuate primarily based on changes in credit spreads and the credit quality of the referenced entities 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default 
they are contracts that are generally held to maturity and principally not subject to collateral calls due to changes in market value 
the unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments will amortize to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure 
in the company also recorded a fair value gain of million  pre tax  related to assured guaranty corp 
s committed capital securities 
our expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  profit commission expense  acquisition costs  operating expenses  interest expense  put option premium expense associated with our committed capital securities the ccs securities and income taxes 
losses and lae are a function of the amount and types of business we write 
losses and lae are based upon estimates of the ultimate aggregate losses inherent in the portfolio 
the risks we take have a low expected frequency of loss and are investment grade at the time we accept the risk 
profit commission expense represents payments made to ceding companies generally based on the profitability of the business reinsured by us 
acquisition costs are related to the production of new business 
certain acquisition costs that vary with and are directly attributable to the production of new business are deferred and recognized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee related costs  including share based compensation  various outside service providers  rent and related costs and other expenses related to maintaining a holding company structure 
these costs do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
interest expense is a function of outstanding debt and the contractual interest rate related to that debt 
put option premium expense  which is included in other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  is a function of the outstanding amount of the ccs securities and the applicable distribution rate 
income taxes are a function of our profitability and the applicable tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that  either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  are determined using estimates and assumptions 
the actual amounts realized could ultimately be materially different from the amounts currently provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the items requiring the most inherently subjective and complex estimates to be reserves for losses and lae  valuation of derivative financial instruments  valuation of investments  other than temporary impairments of investments  premium revenue recognition  deferred acquisition costs  deferred income taxes and accounting for share based compensation 
an understanding of our accounting policies for these items is of critical importance to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions used for these items and should be read in conjunction with the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for non derivative transactions in our financial guaranty direct  financial guaranty assumed reinsurance and mortgage guaranty business include case reserves and portfolio reserves 
see the valuation of derivative financial instruments of the critical accounting estimates section for more information on our derivative transactions 
case reserves are established when there is significant credit deterioration on specific insured obligations and the obligations are in default or default is probable  not necessarily upon non payment of principal or interest by an insured 
case reserves represent the present value of expected future loss payments and lae  net of estimated recoveries  but before considering ceded reinsurance 
this reserving method is different from case reserves established by traditional property and casualty insurance companies  which establish case reserves upon notification of a claim and establish incurred but not reported ibnr reserves for the difference between actuarially estimated ultimate losses and recorded case reserves 
financial guaranty insurance and assumed reinsurance case reserves and related salvage and subrogation  if any  are discounted at the taxable equivalent yield on our investment portfolio  which is approximately  in all periods presented 
when the company becomes entitled to the underlying collateral of an insured credit under salvage and subrogation rights as a result of a claim payment  it records salvage and subrogation as an asset  based on the expected level of recovery 
such amounts are included in the company s balance sheet within other assets 
we record portfolio reserves in our financial guaranty direct  financial guaranty assumed reinsurance and mortgage guaranty business 
portfolio reserves are established with respect to the portion of our business for which case reserves have not been established 
portfolio reserves are not established based on a specific event  rather they are calculated by aggregating the portfolio reserve calculated for each individual transaction 
individual transaction reserves are calculated on a quarterly basis by multiplying the par in force by the product of the ultimate loss and earning factors without regard to discounting 
the ultimate loss factor is defined as the frequency of loss multiplied by the severity of loss  where the frequency is defined as the probability of default for each individual issue 
the earning factor is inception to date earned premium divided by the estimated ultimate written premium for each transaction 
the probability of default is estimated from rating agency data and is based on the transaction s credit rating  industry sector and time until maturity 
the severity is defined as the complement of recovery salvage rates gathered by the rating agencies of defaulting issues and is based on the industry sector 
portfolio reserves are recorded gross of reinsurance 
we have not ceded any amounts under these reinsurance contracts  as our recorded portfolio reserves have not exceeded our contractual retentions  required by said contracts 
the company records an incurred loss that is reflected in the statement of operations upon the establishment of portfolio reserves 
when we initially record a case reserve  we reclassify the corresponding portfolio reserve already recorded for that credit within the balance sheet 
the difference between the initially recorded case reserve and the reclassified portfolio reserve is recorded as a charge in our statement of operations 
any subsequent change in portfolio reserves or the initial case reserves are recorded quarterly as a charge or credit in our statement of operations in the period such estimates change 
due to the inherent uncertainties of estimating loss and lae reserves  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
the chart below demonstrates the portfolio reserve s sensitivity to frequency and severity assumptions 
the change in these estimates represent management s estimate of reasonably possible material changes and are based upon our analysis of historical experience 
portfolio reserves were recalculated with changes made to the default and severity assumptions 
in all scenarios  the starting point used to test the portfolio reserve s sensitivity to the changes in the frequency and severity assumptions was the weighted average frequency and severity by rating and asset class of our insured portfolio 
overall the weighted average default frequency was and the weighted average severity was at december  for example  in the first scenario where the frequency was increased by  each transaction s contribution to the portfolio reserve was recalculated by adding ie  multiplied by to the individual transaction s default frequency 
in thousands of us dollars portfolio reserve reserve increase percentage change portfolio reserve as of december   frequency increase   frequency increase   severity increase   severity increase   frequency and severity increase   in addition to analyzing the sensitivity of our portfolio reserves to possible changes in frequency and severity  we have also considered the affect of changes in assumptions on our financial guaranty and mortgage guaranty case reserves 
at december  case reserves are million 
case reserves may change from our original estimate due to changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  severity factors  credit deterioration of underlying obligations and salvage estimates 
specifically with respect to reserves related to our us home equity line of credit heloc and other us residential mortgage exposures  there exists significant uncertainty as to the ultimate performance of these transactions 
as of december   the company had net par outstanding of billion related to heloc securitizations  of which billion are transactions with countrywide 
countrywide s heloc servicer ratings were recently downgraded by moody s investor services from sq to sq strong and by fitch from rps to rps fully acceptable and placed on watch negative by standard poors 
as of december   the company has recorded portfolio reserves of million and case reserves of million for its heloc exposures 
based on the evidence available at december  the company does not believe loss related to its direct countrywide helocs is probable and  therefore  has not recorded a case reserve 
the performance of our heloc exposures deteriorated during and transactions  particularly those originated in the period from through  continue to perform below our original underwriting expectations 
the ultimate performance of these transactions will depend on many factors  such as the level and timing of loan defaults  interest proceeds generated by the securitized loans  repayment speeds and changes in home prices  as well as the levels of credit support built into each transaction 
other factors also may have a material impact upon the ultimate performance of each transaction  including the ability of the seller and servicer to fulfill all of their contractual obligations including its obligation to fund future draws on lines of credit 
the variables affecting transaction performance are interrelated  difficult to predict and subject to considerable volatility 
consequently  the range of potential outcomes is wide and subject to significant uncertainty 
based on currently available information  the company believes the possible range of case loss is million after tax 
if actual results differ materially from any of our assumptions  the losses incurred could be material to our operating results and financial position 
the company continues to update its evaluation of these exposures as new information becomes available 
as of december   the company had net par outstanding of billion related to subprime residential mortgage backed securitizations subprime rmbs 
of that amount  billion is from transactions issued in the period from through and written in our direct financial guaranty segment 
the majority of the company s subprime rmbs exposure is rated triple a by all major rating agencies  and by the company  at december  as of december   the company had portfolio reserves of million and case reserves of million related to its billion us subprime rmbs exposure  of which million were portfolio reserves related to its billion exposure in the direct financial guaranty segment for transactions issued from through the problems affecting the subprime mortgage market have been widely reported  with rising delinquencies  defaults and foreclosures negatively impacting the performance of subprime rmbs transactions 
those concerns relate primarily to subprime rmbs issued in the period from through the billion exposure that the company has to such transactions in its direct financial guaranty segment benefits from various structural protections  including credit enhancement that on average currently equals approximately of the remaining principal balance of the transactions 
the ultimate performance of these transactions remains highly uncertain and may be subject to considerable volatility due to the influence of many factors  including the level and timing of loan defaults  changes in housing prices and other variables 
the company s current estimate of loss reserves related to its subprime rmbs exposures represent management s best estimate of loss based on the current information  however  actual results may differ materially from current estimates 
the company will continue to monitor the performance of its subprime rmbs exposures and will adjust the risk ratings of those transactions based on actual performance and management s estimates of future performance 
significant deterioration in the performance of these transactions may necessitate a change in the company s assumptions or may result in loses incurred 
either circumstance could result in increases to our case reserves  and such increases could be material to our statement of operations and comprehensive income 
a sensitivity analysis is not appropriate for our other segment reserves since the amounts are reinsured 
we also record ibnr reserves for our other segment 
ibnr is an estimate of losses for which the insured event has occurred but the claim has not yet been reported to us 
in establishing ibnr  we use traditional actuarial methods to estimate the reporting lag of such claims based on historical experience  claim reviews and information reported by ceding companies 
we record ibnr for trade credit reinsurance within our other segment  which is reinsured 
the other segment represents lines of business that we exited or sold as part of our ipo 
for mortgage guaranty transactions we record portfolio reserves in a manner consistent with our financial guaranty business 
while other mortgage guaranty insurance companies do not record portfolio reserves  rather just case and ibnr reserves  we record portfolio reserves because we write business on an excess of loss basis  while other industry participants write quota share or first layer loss business 
we manage and underwrite this business in the same manner as our financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance business because they have similar characteristics as insured obligations of mortgage backed securities 
statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas is the authoritative guidance for an insurance enterprise 
fas prescribes differing reserving methodologies depending on whether a contract fits within its definition of a short duration contract or a long duration contract 
financial guaranty contracts have elements of long duration insurance contracts in that they are irrevocable and extend over a period that may exceed years or more  but for regulatory purposes are reported as property and liability insurance  which are normally considered short duration contracts 
the short duration and long duration classifications have different methods of accounting for premium revenue and contract liability recognition 
additionally  the accounting for deferred acquisition costs dac could be different under the two methods 
we believe the guidance of fas does not expressly address the distinctive characteristics of financial guaranty insurance  so we also apply the analogous guidance of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of fees for guaranteeing a loan eitf  which provides guidance relating to the recognition of fees for guaranteeing a loan  which has similarities to financial guaranty insurance contracts 
under the guidance in eitf  the guarantor should assess the probability of loss on an ongoing basis to determine if a liability should be recognized under fas no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires that a loss be recognized where it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the following tables summarize our reserves for losses and lae by segment and type of reserve as of the dates presented

the company s scale is comparable to that of the nationally recognized rating agencies 
the super senior category  which is not generally used by rating agencies  is used by the company in instances where the company s aaa rated exposure has additional credit enhancement due to either the existence of another security rated aaa that is subordinated to the company s exposure or the company s exposure benefits from a different form of credit enhancement that would pay any claims first in the event that any of the exposures incurs a loss  and such credit enhancement  in management s opinion  causes the company s attachment point to be materially above the aaa attachment point

our surveillance department is responsible for monitoring our portfolio of credits and maintains a list of closely monitored credits cmc 
the closely monitored credits are divided into four categories category low priority  fundamentally sound  greater than normal risk  category medium priority  weakening credit profile  may result in loss  category high priority  claim default probable  case reserve established  category claim paid  case reserve established for future payments 
the closely monitored credits include all below investment grade big exposures where there is a material amount of exposure generally greater than million or a material risk of the company incurring a loss greater than million 
the closely monitored credits also include investment grade ig risks where credit quality is deteriorating and where  in the view of the company  there is significant potential that the risk quality will fall below investment grade 
as of december   the closely monitored credits include approximately of our big exposure  and the remaining big exposure of million was distributed across different credits 
as of december   the closely monitored credits include approximately of our big exposure  and the remaining big exposure of million was distributed across different credits

industry methodology the company s is aware that there are certain differences regarding the measurement of portfolio loss liabilities among companies in the financial guaranty industry 
in january and february  the securities and exchange commission sec staff had discussions concerning these differences with a number of industry participants 
based on those discussions  in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb staff decided additional guidance is necessary regarding financial guaranty contracts 
on april   the fasb issued an exposure draft accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts an interpretation of fasb statement no 
exposure draft 
this exposure draft would clarify how fas applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts  including the methodology to be used to account for premium revenue and claim liabilities 
the scope of this exposure draft is limited to financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises included within the scope of fas responses to the exposure draft were required by june  we and the association of financial guaranty insurers have separately submitted responses before the required date and additionally  participated in a fasb sponsored roundtable discussion 
while certain provisions of the exposure draft are still being analyzed  management believes that the cumulative effect of initially applying the exposure draft  particularly with respect to revenue recognition and claims liability  could be material to the company s financial statements 
a final exposure draft is expected to be issued by the end of the first quarter  with an anticipated effective date of january  until a final pronouncement is issued  the company intends to continue to apply its existing policy with respect to premium revenue and the establishment of both case and portfolio reserves 
valuation of derivative financial instruments the company follows fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  fas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities fas and fas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments fas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
fas and fas require recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
on january  the company adopted fas the primary objectives of fas are i with respect to fas  to address the accounting for beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and ii with respect to fas  eliminate a restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity may hold 
in particular  fas affects the company s determination of which transactions are derivative or non derivative in nature 
we issue credit derivative financial instruments that we view as an extension of our financial guaranty business but that do not qualify for the financial guaranty insurance scope exception under fas and fas and therefore are reported at fair value  with changes in fair value included in our earnings 
since we view these derivative contracts as an extension of our financial guaranty business  we believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect revenue as earned premium  to record estimates of losses and lae on specific credit events as incurred and to record changes in fair value as incurred 
reserves for losses and lae are established on a similar basis as our insurance policies 
other changes in fair value are included in unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments 
we generally hold derivative contracts to maturity 
however  in certain circumstances such as for risk management purposes or as a result of a decision to exit a line of business  we may decide to terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments will amortize to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure 
however  in the event that we terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity the unrealized gain or loss will be realized through premiums earned and losses incurred 
changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts do not reflect actual claims or credit losses  and have no impact on the company s claims paying resources  rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions 
the fair value of these instruments depends on a number of factors including credit spreads  changes in interest rates  recovery rates and the credit ratings of referenced entities 
where available  we use market prices to determine the fair value of these credit derivatives 
if the market prices are not available  the fair value is estimated using a combination of observable market data and valuation models that specifically relate to each type of credit protection 
market conditions at december  were such that market prices were generally not available 
where market prices were not available  we used a combination of observable market data and valuation models  including various market indexes to estimate the fair value of the company s credit derivatives 
these models are primarily developed internally based on market conventions for similar transactions 
management considers the non standard terms of its credit derivative contracts in determining the fair value of these contracts 
these terms differ from credit derivatives sold by companies outside of the financial guaranty industry 
the non standard terms include the absence of collateral support agreements or immediate settlement provisions  relatively high attachment points and the fact that the company does not typically exit derivatives it sells for credit protection purposes  except under specific circumstances such as exiting a line of business 
because of these terms and conditions  the fair value of the company s credit derivatives may not reflect the same prices observed in an actively traded market of credit default swaps that do not contain terms and conditions similar to those observed in the financial guaranty market 
these models and the related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information 
valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information 
management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of derivative instruments is affected by current market conditions 
management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements  performance of underlying assets  life of the instrument  and the extent of credit default swaps exposure the company ceded under reinsurance agreements  and the nature and extent of activity in the financial guaranty credit derivative marketplace 
the assumptions that management uses to determine its fair value may change in the future due to market conditions 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
during the first quarter review of its valuation models  management identified a limitation in its valuation models highlighted by the then widening credit spread environment 
management adjusted its valuation models for this limitation in the first quarter resulting in an adjustment to unrealized gains on derivative financial instruments of million  net of income taxes 
management continues to perform additional analysis  as necessary  to address market anomalies and their effect on its valuation models 
the fair value adjustment recognized in our statement of operations for the year ended december  was a million loss compared with a million gain for the year ended december  and a million loss for the year ended december  the loss of million primarily relates to spreads widening and includes no credit losses  the gain of million primarily relates to the run off of transactions and changes in credit spreads  and the loss of million primarily relates to the run off of transactions and a slight widening in investment grade corporate spreads over that period 
for the year ended  approximately of the company s unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments is due to a decline in the market value of high yield and investment grade corporate collateralized loan obligation transactions  with the balance generated by lower market values principally in the residential and commercial mortgage backed securities markets 
with considerable volatility continuing in the market  the fair value adjustment amount will fluctuate significantly in future periods 
the amount also included a fair value gain of million  pre tax  related to assured guaranty corp 
s committed capital securities 
valuation of investments as of december   and  we had total investments of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the fair values of all of our investments are calculated from independent market valuations 
the fair values of the company s us treasury securities are primarily determined based upon broker dealer quotes obtained from several independent active market makers 
the fair values of the company s portfolio other than us treasury securities are determined primarily using matrix pricing models 
the matrix pricing models incorporate factors such as tranche type  collateral coupons  average life  payment speeds  and spreads  in order to calculate the fair values of specific securities owned by the company 
as of december   approximately of our investments were long term fixed maturity securities  and our portfolio had an average duration of years  compared with and years as of december  changes in interest rates affect the value of our fixed maturity portfolio 
as interest rates fall  the fair value of fixed maturity securities increases and as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed maturity securities decreases 
the company s portfolio is comprised primarily of high quality  liquid instruments 
we continue to receive sufficient information to value our investments and have not had to modify our approach due to the current market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value net of related income taxes on our investment portfolio as of december  based upon an assumed parallel shift in interest rates across the entire yield curve change in interest rates estimated increase decrease in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information 
other than temporary impairments we have a formal review process for all securities in our investment portfolio  including a review for impairment losses 
factors considered when assessing impairment include a decline in the market value of a security by or more below amortized cost for a continuous period of at least six months  a decline in the market value of a security for a continuous period of months  recent credit downgrades of the applicable security or the issuer by rating agencies  the financial condition of the applicable issuer  whether scheduled interest payments are past due  and whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for anticipated recoveries in fair value 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record the decline as an unrealized loss on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our statement of operations 
our assessment of a decline in value includes management s current assessment of the factors noted above 
if that assessment changes in the future  we may ultimately record a loss after having originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary 
we did not record any realized losses due to other than temporary declines in  and the following table summarizes the unrealized losses in our investment portfolio by type of security and the length of time such securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of the dates indicated as of december  as of december  length of time in continuous unrealized loss position estimated fair value gross unrealized losses estimated fair value gross unrealized losses in millions municipal securities months months greater than months corporate and foreign government securities months months greater than months us government obligations months months greater than months mortgage and asset backed securities months months greater than months total the following table summarizes the unrealized losses in our investment portfolio by type of security and remaining time to maturity as of the dates indicated as of december  as of december  remaining time to maturity estimated fair value gross unrealized losses estimated fair value gross unrealized losses in millions municipal securities due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years corporate and foreign government securities due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years us government obligations due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years mortgage and asset backed securities total the following table summarizes  for all securities sold at a loss through december  and  the fair value and realized loss by length of time such securities were in a continuous unrealized loss position prior to the date of sale year ended december  length of time in continuous unrealized loss position prior to sale estimated fair value gross realized losses estimated fair value gross realized losses in millions municipal securities months months greater than months corporate and foreign government securities months months greater than months us government securities months months greater than months mortgage and asset backed securities months months greater than months total premium revenue recognition premiums are received either upfront or in installments 
upfront premiums are earned in proportion to the expiration of the amount at risk 
each installment premium is earned ratably over its installment period  generally one year or less 
premium earnings under both the upfront and installment revenue recognition methods are based upon and are in proportion to the principal amount guaranteed and therefore result in higher premium earnings during periods where guaranteed principal is higher 
for insured bonds for which the par value outstanding is declining during the insurance period  upfront premium earnings are greater in the earlier periods thus matching revenue recognition with the underlying risk 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our gross written premiums were received upfront  and  and  respectively  were received in installments 
the premiums are allocated in accordance with the principal amortization schedule of the related bond issue and are earned ratably over the amortization period 
when an insured issue is retired early  is called by the issuer  or is in substance paid in advance through a refunding accomplished by placing us government securities in escrow  the remaining unearned premium reserves are earned at that time 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that is applicable to the unexpired amount at risk of insured bonds 
in our reinsurance businesses  we estimate the ultimate written and earned premiums to be received from a ceding company at the end of each quarter and the end of each year because some of our ceding companies report premium data anywhere from to days after the end of the relevant period 
written premiums reported in our statement of operations are based upon reports received from ceding companies supplemented by our own estimates of premium for which ceding company reports have not yet been received 
as of december   and the assumed premium estimate and related ceding commissions included in our consolidated financial statements are million and million  million and million and million and million  respectively 
key assumptions used to arrive at management s best estimate of assumed premiums are premium amounts reported historically and informal communications with ceding companies 
differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which the actual amounts are determined 
historically  the differences have not been material 
we do not record a provision for doubtful accounts related to our assumed premium estimate 
historically  there have not been any material issues related to the collectibility of assumed premium 
no provision for doubtful accounts related to our premium receivable was recorded for  or deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs incurred  other than those associated with credit derivative products  that vary with and are directly related to the production of new business are deferred and amortized in relation to earned premiums 
these costs include direct and indirect expenses such as ceding commissions  brokerage expenses and the cost of underwriting and marketing personnel 
as of december  and  we had deferred acquisition costs of million and million  respectively 
ceding commissions paid to primary insurers are the largest component of deferred acquisition costs  constituting and of total deferred acquisition costs as of december  and  respectively 
management uses its judgment in determining what types of costs should be deferred  as well as what percentage of these costs should be deferred 
we annually conduct a study to determine which operating costs vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of new business and qualify for deferral 
ceding commissions received on premiums we cede to other reinsurers reduce acquisition costs 
anticipated losses  lae and the remaining costs of servicing the insured or reinsured business are considered in determining the recoverability of acquisition costs 
acquisition costs associated with credit derivative products are expensed as incurred 
when an insured issue is retired early  as discussed in the premium revenue recognition section of these critical accounting estimates  the remaining related deferred acquisition cost is expensed at that time 
deferred income taxes as of december  and  we had a net deferred income tax asset of million and a net deferred income tax liability of million  respectively 
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to us income tax 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
such temporary differences relate principally to unrealized gains and losses on investments and derivative financial instruments  deferred acquisition costs  reserves for losses and lae  unearned premium reserves  net operating loss carryforwards nols and statutory contingency reserves 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to the amount that in management s opinion is more likely than not to be realized

adoption of fin the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  as a result of the adoption of fin  the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits and increased retained earnings by million 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of january  was million 
this entire amount  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
subsequent to the adoption of fin  the irs published final regulations on the treatment of consolidated losses 
as a result of these regulations the utilization of certain capital losses is no longer at a level that would require recording an associated liability for an uncertain tax position 
as such  the company decreased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits and its provision for income taxes million during the period ended march  in september  upon completion of the irs audit of assured guaranty overseas us holdings inc and subsidiaries  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by approximately million 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of december  is million  and is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that this amount will change significantly in the next twelve months 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as of the date of adoption  the company has accrued million in interest and penalties 
liability for tax basis step up adjustment in connection with the ipo  the company and ace financial services inc afs  a subsidiary of ace  entered into a tax allocation agreement  whereby the company and afs made a section h election that has the effect of increasing the tax basis of certain affected subsidiaries tangible and intangible assets to fair value 
future tax benefits that the company derives from the election will be payable to afs when realized by the company 
as a result of the election  the company has adjusted its net deferred tax liability to reflect the new tax basis of the company s affected assets 
the additional basis is expected to result in increased future income tax deductions and  accordingly  may reduce income taxes otherwise payable by the company 
any tax benefit realized by the company will be paid to afs 
such tax benefits will generally be calculated by comparing the company s affected subsidiaries actual taxes to the taxes that would have been owed by those subsidiaries had the increase in basis not occurred 
after a year period  to the extent there remains an unrealized tax benefit  the company and afs will negotiate a settlement of the unrealized benefit based on the expected realization at that time 
the company initially recorded a million reduction of its existing deferred tax liability  based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of the section h election 
under the tax allocation agreement  the company estimated that  as of the ipo date  it was obligated to pay million to afs and accordingly established this amount as a liability 
the initial difference  which is attributable to the change in the tax basis of certain liabilities for which there is no associated step up in the tax basis of its assets and no amounts due to afs  resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million 
the company has paid ace and correspondingly reduced its liability by million and million in and  respectively

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas we disclosed our net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas no 
revised  share based payment fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r

total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
as a result of the adoption of fas r  the income tax effects of compensatory stock options are included in the computation of the income tax expense benefit  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  subject to certain prospective adjustments to shareholders equity for the differences between the income tax effects of expenses recognized in the results of operations and the related amounts deducted for income tax purposes 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the tax benefits relating to the income tax deductions for compensatory stock options were recorded directly to shareholders equity 
the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fair value of options issued is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in  and dividend yield expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years years years forfeiture rate these assumptions were based on the following the expected dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend and share price on the grant date  expected volatility is estimated at the date of grant based on the historical share price volatility  calculated on a daily basis  the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term to the granted stock options  the expected life is based on the average expected term of our guideline companies  which are defined as similar or peer entities  since the company has insufficient expected life data  the forfeiture rate is based on the rate used by our guideline companies  since the company has insufficient forfeiture data 
estimated forfeitures will be reassessed at each balance sheet date and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
for options granted before january   the company amortizes the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted on or after january   the company amortizes the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods  with the exception of retirement eligible employees 
stock options are generally granted once a year with exercise prices equal to the closing price on the date of grant 
the company may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect the company s net income or earnings per share

unrealized gains losses on derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value as required by fas  fas and fas however  as explained under critical accounting estimates  we record part of the change in fair value in the loss and lae reserves as well as in unearned premium reserves 
the fair value adjustment for the year ended december  was a million loss compared with a million gain for the year ended december  and a million loss for the same period in the change in fair value for was attributable to spreads widening and includes no credit losses 
for the year ended  approximately of the company s unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments was due to a decline in the market value of high yield and investment grade corporate collateralized loan obligation transactions  with the balance generated by lower market values principally in the residential and commercial mortgage backed securities markets 
changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts do not reflect actual claims or credit losses  and have no impact on the company s claims paying resources  rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions 
with considerable volatility continuing in the market  the fair value adjustment amount will fluctuate significantly in future periods 
the amount also included a fair value gain of million  pre tax  related to assured guaranty corp 
s committed capital securities 
the fair value change of million for was related to many factors but primarily due to run off of transactions and tightening in credit spreads 
the loss of million primarily relates to the run off of transactions and a slight widening in investment grade corporate spreads 
unrealized losses gains on derivative financial instruments  net of related income taxes  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we enter into credit derivative contracts which require us to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default 
they are contracts that are generally held to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments will amortize to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure

the financial guaranty reinsurance segment included million in loss recoveries from a third party litigation settlement agreement  with two parties  relating to a reinsurance claim incurred in and this recovery was offset by an addition to loss reserves of million  consisting of a million addition to case reserves and a reduction of million to portfolio reserves due to a reinsurance client ceding losses on two aircraft related transactions 
our other segment in was impacted by the commutation and retrocession of certain lines of business that we no longer underwrite as well as a million recovery related to the equity layer credit protection business 
profit commission expense profit commissions  which are primarily related to our mortgage guaranty segment  allow the ceding company to share favorable experience on a reinsurance contract due to lower than expected losses 
expected or favorable loss development generates profit commission expense  while the inverse occurs on unfavorable loss development 
portfolio reserves are not a component of these profit commission calculations 
in future years the primary component of profit commissions will be from the fsa transaction  discussed earlier 
for the years ended december   and profit commissions were million  million and million  respectively 
the decreases in profit commission expense for both and were due to the run off of mortgage guaranty experience rated quota share treaties  which have a large profit commission component 
also adding to the decrease was a particular financial guaranty reinsurance treaty  which contains a profit commission component  that had reduced net earned premiums associated with it in not all treaties in our financial guaranty reinsurance segment have a profit commission component

segment results of operations our financial results include four principal business segments financial guaranty direct  financial guaranty reinsurance  mortgage guaranty and other 
management uses underwriting gains and losses as the primary measure of each segment s financial performance 
underwriting gain includes net earned premiums  loss and loss adjustment expenses  profit commission expense  acquisition costs and other operating expenses that are directly related to the operations of our insurance businesses 
this measure excludes certain revenue and expense items  such as net investment income  realized investment gains and losses  unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments  and interest and other expenses  that are not directly related to the underwriting performance of our insurance operations  but are included in net income 
financial guaranty direct segment the financial guaranty direct segment consists of our primary financial guaranty insurance business and our credit derivative business 
financial guaranty insurance provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty that protects the holder of a financial obligation against non payment of principal and interest when due 
financial guaranty insurance may be issued to the holders of the insured obligations at the time of issuance of those obligations  or may be issued in the secondary market to holders of public bonds and structured securities 
as an alternative to traditional financial guaranty insurance  credit protection on a particular security or issuer can also be provided through a credit derivative  such as a credit default swap 
under a credit default swap  the seller of protection makes a specified payment to the buyer of protection upon the occurrence of one or more specified credit events with respect to a reference obligation or a particular reference entity 
credit derivatives typically provide protection to a buyer rather than credit enhancement of an issue as in traditional financial guaranty insurance

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity  both on a short term basis for the next twelve months and a long term basis beyond the next twelve months  is largely dependent upon the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us  external financings and net investment income from our invested assets 
our liquidity requirements include the payment of our operating expenses  interest on our debt  and dividends on our common shares 
we may also require liquidity to make periodic capital investments in our operating subsidiaries 
in the ordinary course of our business  we evaluate our liquidity needs and capital resources in light of holding company expenses  debt related expenses and our dividend policy  as well as rating agency considerations 
based on the amount of dividends we expect to receive from our subsidiaries and the income we expect to receive from our invested assets  management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our needs over the next twelve months  including the ability to pay dividends on our common shares 
total cash paid in  and for dividends to shareholders was million  or per common share  million  or per common share  and million  or per common share  respectively

consequently  although management believes that we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and other obligations over the long term  it remains possible that we may be required to seek external debt or equity financing in order to meet our operating expenses  debt service obligations or pay dividends on our common shares 
we anticipate that a major source of our liquidity  for the next twelve months and for the longer term  will be amounts paid by our operating subsidiaries as dividends

the custodial trust s expenses including any expenses of the pass through trust for the period will be paid separately by agc pursuant to the custodial trust expense reimbursement agreement 
upon a fixed rate distribution event  the distribution rate on the agc preferred stock will equal the fixed rate equivalent of one month libor plus 
a fixed rate distribution event will be deemed to have occurred during the auction rate mode when agc preferred stock is outstanding  if agc elects to have the agc preferred stock bear dividends at a fixed rate  agc fails to pay dividends on the agc preferred stock for the related distribution period and such failure continues for five business days or agc fails to pay the fees and expenses of the custodial trust for the related distribution period pursuant to the custodial trust expense reimbursement agreement and such failure continues for five business days 
during the flexed rate period and for any period in which agc preferred stock is held by a custodial trust  dividends will be paid monthly  except that during the auction rate mode dividends will be paid every days 
following a fixed rate distribution event  dividends will be paid every days 
following exercise of the put option during any flexed rate period  agc may redeem the agc preferred stock held by a custodial trust in whole and not in part on any distribution payment date by paying a redemption price to such custodial trust in an amount equal to the liquidation preference amount of the agc preferred stock plus any accrued but unpaid dividends on the agc preferred stock for the then current distribution period 
if agc redeems the agc preferred stock held by a custodial trust  the custodial trust will reinvest the redemption proceeds in eligible assets and  in accordance with the put agreement  agc will pay the put premium to the custodial trust 
if the agc preferred stock was distributed to holders of ccs securities during any flexed rate period then agc may not redeem the agc preferred stock until the end of such period 
following exercise of the put option during the auction rate mode or at the end of any flexed rate period  agc may redeem the agc preferred stock held by a custodial trust in whole or in part x on the final distribution payment date of the applicable flexed rate period and y on any distribution payment date in the auction rate mode  by paying a redemption price to the custodial trust in an amount equal to the liquidation preference amount of the agc preferred stock to be redeemed plus any accrued but unpaid dividends on such agc preferred stock for the then current distribution period 
if agc partially redeems the agc preferred stock held by a custodial trust  the redemption proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the holders of the ccs securities and  if the pass through trust is the holder of ccs securities  distributed by the pass through trust to holders of pass through securities and a corresponding reduction in the aggregate face amount of ccs securities and  if the pass through trust is the holder of ccs securities  pass through trust securities will be made  provided that agc must redeem all of the agc preferred stock if after giving effect to a partial redemption  the aggregate liquidation preference amount of the agc preferred stock held by such custodial trust immediately following such redemption would be less than  if a fixed rate distribution event occurs  agc may not redeem the agc preferred stock for a period of two years from the date of such fixed rate distribution event

market risk market risk represents the potential for losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market conditions 
the primary market risks that impact the value of our financial instruments are interest rate risk  basis risk  such as taxable interest rates relative to tax exempt interest rates  and credit spread risk 
each of these risks and the specific types of financial instruments impacted are described below 
senior managers in our surveillance department are responsible for monitoring risk limits and applying risk measurement methodologies 
the estimation of potential losses arising from adverse changes in market conditions is a key element in managing market risk 
we use various systems  models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage market risk 
these models include estimates made by management that use current and historic market information 
the valuation results from these models could differ materially from amounts that actually are realized in the market 
see critical accounting estimates valuation of investments 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates consist primarily of investment securities 
the primary objective in managing our investment portfolio is generation of an optimal level of after tax investment income while preserving capital and maintaining adequate liquidity 
investment strategies are based on many factors  including our tax position  fluctuation in interest rates  regulatory and rating agency criteria and other market factors 
as of january  we have retained blackrock financial management  inc to manage our investment portfolio 
these investment managers manage our fixed maturity investment portfolio in accordance with investment guidelines approved by our board of directors 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in credit spreads consist primarily of assured guaranty s outstanding credit derivative contracts 
we enter into credit derivative contracts which require us to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default  and are principally not subject to collateral calls due to changes in market value 
in general  the company structures derivative transactions such that the method for making loss payments is similar to that for financial guaranty policies and only occurs as losses are realized on the underlying reference obligation 
nonetheless  credit derivative transactions are governed by international swaps and derivatives association  inc isda documentation and may operate differently from financial guaranty policies 
for example  our control rights with respect to a reference obligation under a credit derivative may be more limited than when we issue a financial guaranty policy 
in addition  while our exposure under credit derivatives  like our exposure under financial guaranty policies  have been generally for as long as the reference obligation remains outstanding  unlike financial guaranty policies  a credit derivative may be terminated for a breach of the isda documentation or other specific events 
in some older credit derivative transactions  one such specified event is the failure of agc or ag re to maintain specified financial strength ratings ranging from bbb to aa 
if a credit derivative is terminated we could be required to make a mark to market payment as determined under the isda documentation 
for example  if agc s rating were downgraded to a  under market conditions at december   if the counterparties exercised their right to terminate their credit derivatives  agc would have been required to make mark to market payments of approximately million 
as of december  we had pre ipo transactions with approximately billion of par subject to collateral posting due to changes in market value 
currently no collateral posting is required or anticipated for these transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are a function of changes in the estimated fair value of our credit derivative contracts 
if credit spreads of the underlying obligations change  the fair value of the related credit derivative changes 
market liquidity could also impact valuations of the underlying obligations 
as such  assured guaranty experiences mark to market gains or losses 
we generally hold these derivative contracts to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments will amortize to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair values on the net balance of assured guaranty s net structured credit default swap derivative positions assuming immediate parallel shifts in credit spreads at december  dollars in millions credit spreads estimated net fair value pre tax estimated pre tax change in gain loss december  widening in spreads  widening in spreads  widening in spreads widening in spreads base scenario narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads the impact of changes in credit spreads will vary based upon the volume  tenor  interest rates  and other market conditions at the time these fair values are determined 
in addition  since each transaction has unique collateral and structure terms  the underlying change in fair value of each transaction may vary considerably 
during  assured guaranty incurred net mark to market losses on credit derivative contracts of million  pre tax  related to high yield and investment grade corporate collateralized loan obligations clos  as well as residential and commercial mortgage backed securities exposures 
the unrealized loss on derivatives resulted largely from the decline in fixed income security market prices resulting from higher credit spreads  primarily in the third and fourth quarters of  due to the recent lack of liquidity in the high yield cdo and clo market as well as continuing market concerns over the most recent vintages of subprime residential mortgage backed securities  rather than from credit rating downgrades  delinquencies or defaults on securities guaranteed by the company

fas allows entities to voluntarily choose  at specified election dates  to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities as well as certain nonfinancial instruments that are similar to financial instruments at fair value the fair value option 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  fas specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument shall be reported in the statement of operations and comprehensive income
