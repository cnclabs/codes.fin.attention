bad debt expense was materially unchanged at less than  for both years ended december  and income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended and was 
at december   a valuation allowance was recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets as losses in recent years created uncertainty about the realization of tax benefits in future years 
the existence of a net operating loss carryforward at december  means that income taxes associated with any potential taxable earnings for the year ended december  will be offset by a corresponding decrease of this valuation allowance  resulting in an expected effective tax rate of for the year ended december  as well 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility with a bank 
additionally  during the second quarter of  we determined that capital expenditures which needed to be completed in to support forecasted volumes and working capital requirements to support our seasonal volume increase during the fourth quarter of required additional short term funding 
also adding to the short term funding need was the completion of final build out of the hebron  kentucky facility servicing the target 
com operations and the working capital needs supporting our september  nine months year to date growth in revenue of million or to million in revenue at september  from million during the nine months ended september  accordingly  the company obtained million in capital in the form of a second lien credit agreement on september  which is subordinate to the revolving credit facility with wachovia 
the specific terms of the million second lien loan are more fully described below 
we anticipate repaying the loan before its initial maturity on september  the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  as compared to million at december  additionally  during  the company decreased its borrowings under its revolving credit facility discussed below to million at december  compared to million at december  the primary use of borrowings under the credit facility is to fund recurring working capital needs resulting from our normal monthly billing and expenditure cycles  capital expenditures and our seasonal fourth quarter working capital needs 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities in the year ended december  compared to using  of cash from operating activities for the year ended december  this million of improved cash from operating activities was mainly the result of the company generating  of net income in compared to a loss of million in the company anticipates positive cash flows from operations in the company has a revolving bank credit agreement with wachovia which matures in march and has a maximum borrowing limit of million 
although the maximum borrowing limit is million  the credit facility limits borrowings to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  which totaled million at december  as provided for in the second waiver agreement dated april   our chairman and chief executive officer  scott dorfman  has granted to the bank a security interest in million of his personal securities  which after application of a factor  results in million of additional collateral to support the borrowing limit of million under the credit facility 
additionally  the terms of the credit facility provide that the amount borrowed and outstanding at any time combined with certain reserves for rental payments  letters of credit outstanding and general reserves be subtracted from the facility limit or the value of the total collateral to arrive at an amount of unused availability to borrow under the line of credit 
the total collateral under the credit facility at december  amounted to million 
the amount borrowed and outstanding and the total value of reserves and letters of credit outstanding at december  amounted to million 
as a result  the company had million of borrowing availability under the revolving credit line at december  the company has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the lender as collateral under this revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains a restrictive fixed charge coverage ratio 
the provisions of the revolving credit agreement require that the company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender  and allow the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants 
accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
the fixed charge coverage ratio requires the company to maintain a minimum twelve month trailing fixed charge coverage ratio of to from december through march  to for the months of april and may  to from june through september and to from october the maturity of the facility in march the company reported a fixed charge ratio of to for the month of december on september  the company and the bank entered into the fifth amendment to its revolving bank credit facility entitled fifth amendment agreement the fifth amendment whereby the bank agreed to the company s entering into a debt obligation described below as the second lien credit agreement which is subordinated to the bank s position as senior lender to the company

the reduction of the maximum available revolver amount to million was consistent with the level of outstanding amounts owed under the revolving credit facility during the previous nine months and will result in lower unused revolving credit facility fees than the company has experienced while the maximum availability was million 
simultaneous with execution of the fifth amendment agreement  the company entered into the second lien term loan and security agreement the second lien credit agreement with chatham credit management iii  llc  as agent for chatham investment fund iii  llc  chatham investment fund qp iii  llc  and certain other lenders party thereto from time to time  and chatham credit management iii  llc  as administrative agent chatham credit management iii  llc  chatham investment fund iii  llc  chatham investment fund qp iii  llc  and chatham credit management iii  llc are collectively referred to as chatham

the second lien credit facility has a one year term with the option to renew for five months resulting in an ultimate maturity date of march   the same date on which the revolving bank credit agreement  described above  matures 
if the option to renew for five months is exercised  the company will be obligated to pay five twelfths or of the initial closing and success fees incurred when the second lien credit facility was entered into on september  there are no scheduled principal payments before maturity under the second lien credit facility

the additional note will be repaid in accordance with the terms of the second lien credit agreement 
in the event of default  all obligations will bear interest at the otherwise applicable rate plus per annum until the event of default is cured

the second lien credit agreement also limits the amount of capital expenditures the company may make in any fiscal year beginning in the fiscal year to  the second lien credit agreement contains representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants and events of default and  as appropriate  grace periods 
based on current projections  the company believes that it will be able to comply with the terms and conditions of the revolving credit agreement  as amended  and the second lien credit agreement 
simultaneous with the execution of the fifth amendment and the second lien credit agreement  the bank and chatham entered into an intercreditor agreement defining the relative priority of security interests and other subordination terms 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is payable monthly at rates equal to the prime rate  or at the company s option  libor plus up to basis points  however so long as the fixed charge ratio is less than to  the interest rate will be equal to the prime rate plus or at the company s option  libor plus basis points 
interest on borrowings under the second lien credit agreement is accrued on a monthly basis equal to the greater of a libor or b plus for a rate of of the principal balance plus accrued interest payable outstanding on the million loan 
for the year ended december   we paid interest expense of  on the revolving credit agreement at a weighted average interest rate of and  of interest expense on the second lien credit agreement loan for the period september   its inception  to december  our weighted average interest rate in  including amounts borrowed under both the revolving credit agreement and the second lien credit agreement  was 
during the year ended december   the company incurred interest expense related to the line of credit of approximately  resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 
the company also incurred unused revolving credit facility fees of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the company generated million in cash flow from operating activities compared to using  cash in operating activities in the year ended december   or an increase in cash flow from operations of million in when compared to this million increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily the result of i a net profit of  in compared to a net loss of million in  ii non cash depreciation and amortization expense increasing to million in compared to million in and iii the net effect of all other working capital accounts using million of cash in compared with the net effect of all other working capital accounts providing cash of  in during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million in the million of expenditures in was comprised of million of capital expenditures and  paid under the terms of the clientlogic acquisition agreement dated october  the million of expenditures in was comprised of million paid in connection with the clientlogic reverse logistics business and million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreased spending for over was primarily related to the new facility opened for target 
com which required million of capital expenditures in compared to million in we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in this estimate is subject to various contingencies  including the possible need to incur additional capital expenditures related to new clients or significant new initiatives by existing clients 
during the year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million in the same period in in  approximately million of cash  after payment of million of loan commitment fees  was provided through creation of the second lien term loan offset by repayment of million of obligations outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
in  million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility were incurred mainly to fund the capital expenditures discussed above 
the company estimates that its cash and financing needs through will be met by cash flows from operations and its credit facility 
included in the cash needs for is million for repayment of the second lien term loan  which includes the initial loan of million and the additional note for interest from january to june  the company generated positive cash flows from operations in anticipates doing so again in nevertheless  there are many factors beyond the control of the company  including general economic and market conditions that could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
if these factors result in the inability to repay the second lien term loan before it matures on september   the terms of the loan provide for an extension to march  which coincides with the maturity date of the revolving credit facility with the bank 
we believe that the extension of time through march  provides sufficient time to identify and obtain a source for additional or revised credit facilities if we are unable to fund the million to repay the second lien term loan during the company s primary long term contractual commitments consist of operating leases 
as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

for additional information  including information regarding the interest related to the term loan  see note critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our financial statements 
the policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below reserve for uncollectible accounts 
the company makes estimates each reporting period associated with its reserve for uncollectible accounts 
these estimates are based on the aging of the receivables and known specific facts and circumstances 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
goodwill represents the cost of an acquired enterprise in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   which changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
innotrac s goodwill carrying amount as of december  and was million 
this asset relates to the goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of universal distribution services uds in december and the acquisition of ifulfillment  inc in july in accordance with sfas no 
 the company performs a valuation review of the company s goodwill each year 
the company recognizes only one reporting unit in its valuation analysis 
the results of that valuation  as performed in the first quarter of  supported that the fair value of the reporting unit at january  exceeds the net book value of the net assets  including goodwill  and thus no impairment currently exists 
the company will perform this impairment test annually as of january or sooner if circumstances dictate 
accounting for income taxes 
innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the company considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
innotrac s gross deferred tax asset as of december  is million 
this deferred tax asset was generated primarily by net operating loss carryforwards created primarily by the special charge of million recorded in and the net losses generated in   and innotrac has a net operating loss carryforward of million at december  that expires between and innotrac s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  collection of existing outstanding accounts receivable  competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond management s control 
these factors  combined with losses in recent years prior to  create uncertainty about the ultimate realization of the gross deferred tax asset in future years 
although the company expects to generate taxable earnings in  the net losses incurred in and prior years result in an inability to recognize the value of any deferred tax asset resulting from the prior years losses 
therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million and million has been recorded as of december  and  respectively against net deferred tax assets 
income taxes associated with future earnings will be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance in that future year 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax expense of  was offset by a corresponding decrease of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
when and if the company can return to consistent profitability and management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated 
accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that the company determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon audit  based on the technical merits of the position

the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement
