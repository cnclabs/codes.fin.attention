item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bank mutual corporation which we sometimes refer to as we or the company is a federally registered unitary savings and loan bank holding company which holds all of the outstanding shares of bank mutual  a federal savings bank bank mutual or the bank 
comparisons of financial condition at december  and assets bank mutual corporation s total assets at december   were billion as compared to billion at december  total assets increased slightly in primarily as a result of growth in securities available for sale  partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents  loans receivable and other assets 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million in primarily as a result of a decrease in cash and due from banks at december  the interest earning deposits increase was the result of improved collection efforts of cash items 
investment securities available for sale increased million during as a result of purchasing additional investment securities and an increase in market value 
mortgage related securities available for sale increased million in primarily as a result of purchasing additional mortgage related securities and an increase in market value  partially offset by repayments 
the current portfolio has a weighted average yield of approximately at december  at december   we had million of private label collateralized mortgage obligations cmos in our investment portfolio 
our private label cmos have primarily fixed and adjustable rate one to four family mortgage loans as their underlying collateral 
private label cmos have more credit risk than government agency cmos 
see business investment activities item the following table sets forth our mortgage  consumer and commercial loan originations and purchases during the year ended december  in thousands originations mortgage loans one to four family multi family and commercial real estate consumer loans commercial business loans total loans originated purchases mortgage loans total loans originated and purchased loan originations increased million in as compared to loan originations in  primarily as a result of increased emphasis on loan originations 
in one to four family loan originations decreased million  or and consumer loans decreased million  or because of higher interest rates  reduced home purchases and a slowing economy 
multi family and commercial real estate loan origination increased million  or primarily due to the increased emphasis on originations 
a majority of the consumer loan originations continued to be first and second mortgage loans 
in addition  as we previously disclosed  we discontinued the origination of auto loans through sfc  our owned subsidiary  in may we decreased our purchases of mortgage loans during as a result of the opportunity for higher yields on investments and other loan originations 
properties securing all of the purchased mortgage loans are located in wisconsin 

table of contents commercial business loan originations increased million or in primarily as a result of the increased emphasis on commercial lending 
we anticipate that we will continue our emphasis on commercial loans  investment real estate and to aid our asset and liability management and to aid in our overall profitability  although with somewhat more risk than traditional mortgage products 
loans held for sale at december  as compared to december  increased million as a result of increased fixed rate mortgage loan originations and our policy to sell most of the  and year fixed rate mortgage loans 
in the second quarter of  we began to retain certain and year fixed interest rate mortgage loans because those loans had characteristics which historically have indicated that they will be outstanding for a relatively short period of time 
loans receivable decreased million in as a result of a decrease in the one to four family  construction and development mortgage and consumer loan portfolios 
the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio decreased million  or primarily as a result of increased fixed rate mortgage loan sales and reduced mortgage loan purchases from third parties and increased adjustable interest rate mortgage loan originations which are retained in the portfolio 
the multi family portfolio increased million or primarily as a result of increased multi family originations 
management continues to emphasize this portion of the loan portfolio 
specifically  we increased the number of loan officers 
construction and development mortgage loans decreased million or primarily as a result of decreased one to four family and multi family construction loan originations 
the commercial real estate portfolio increased million or primarily as a result of increased loan originations 
the consumer loan portfolio decreased million or primarily as a result of reduced consumer loan originations and the discontinuance of automobile originations through sfc 
historically  consumer loan originations decrease as residential mortgage loan originations decrease since many of our consumer loans are second mortgage loans and most second mortgages are cross sold at the time of the first mortgage loan origination 
in addition in may of  we discontinued originating indirect automobile loans through our owned subsidiary  sfc 
this decision decreased our automobile loan originations and the outstanding automobile loan portfolio and was in response to more profitable loan or investment alternatives 
the commercial business loan portfolio increased million or primarily as a result of increased emphasis on the commercial business loan program 
the competition to acquire and retain large commercial loans has also been intense with some of our commercial customers receiving interest rate offerings that we chose not to match 
as a result  those loans were paid off or not originated 
management expects to continue to emphasize consumer  non residential mortgage loan  multi family loan  and commercial business loan originations  as we believe they will continue to add to the overall profitability and aid in the management of interest rate risk 
however  these loans can present higher credit risks than residential mortgage loans 
goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of first northern capital corp 
first northern in and first federal bancshares of eau claire first federal in under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it will be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
no impairment of goodwill occurred in  or other intangible assets are composed of core deposit base intangibles which were also the result of the first northern and first federal acquisitions 
other intangible assets are amortized over their expected life and tested for impairment at least annually 
mortgage servicing rights are established on mortgage loans that we originate and sell 
see significant accounting policies and comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and noninterest income below for a further discussion of mortgage servicing rights 

table of contents other assets are comprised of the following at december  in thousands accrued interest mortgage related securities investment securities loans receivable total accrued interest foreclosed properties and repossessed assets premises and equipment federal home loan bank stock  at cost bank owned life insurance prepaid and other our foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased to million and non performing loans decreased to million at december  as compared to million and million at december   respectively 
the decrease in non performing loans was primarily due to the repayment of one non performing commercial business loan in the first quarter of we believe that we continue to have good asset quality  particularly in our residential portfolio  and the homes  boats  recreational vehicles and other items that have been repossessed  are small in dollar amount in comparison to the size of our loan portfolio 
premises and equipment increased million in primarily as a result of adding two new offices 
we anticipate that up to two new bank offices will be established in one effect of these new bank offices will be an increase to our premises and equipment depreciation expense 
federal home loan bank fhlb of chicago stock increased  because we purchased shares 
fhlb of chicago stock is redeemable at par 
the fhlb of chicago requires that its members own fhlb of chicago stock as a condition for borrowing  and we increased our ownership because of increased borrowings outstanding 
the fhlb of chicago generally pays dividends not to exceed of its adjusted core income  which is net income excluding gains or losses from non recurring events 
in the fhlb chicago paid dividends on it s stock during the first three quarters that equaled approximately or  in the aggregate  but suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of and so far the first quarter of this suspension of dividends was due the fhlb chicago entering into a memorandum of understanding with its primary regulator the federal housing finance board the board which among other things restricted the dividends that the fhlb chicago could pay without prior approval of the board

bank owned life insurance boli is an asset that we use to partially offset the future cost of employee benefits 
boli is long term life insurance on the lives of certain current and past employees where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by us 
we value boli at the amount which we could obtain if we cashed in the policies at the current time 
the cash value accumulation on boli is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the insured person s death and certain other conditions are met 
we purchased an additional million of boli in december of to help offset increased future employee benefit costs 
prepaid and other decreased primarily due to the settlement of a security purchased at december  
table of contents liabilities deposits decreased million in primarily as a result of an a decrease in certificates of deposit accounts  offset by a small increase in core deposit accounts  offset by a reduction in jumbo certificates of deposit and core deposits 
at december   wholesale and jumbo cd deposits were million as compared to million at december  we utilize wholesale and jumbo deposits in lieu of retail deposits when they cost less  fit a specific maturity period or when deposits are needed very quickly 
our retail certificates of deposit increased million and our core deposits checking  savings and money market accounts increased million as a result of new offices and increased marketing efforts 
our borrowings increased million in  as a result of our stock repurchase program and to a lesser degree to purchase additional available for sale securities 
at december  million of the total million borrowings have a fixed interest rate but after an initial period of months to years can be called by the fhlb chicago quarterly 
while we expect that we would be able to refinance these borrowings with the fhlb  we cannot provide any assurances that we could do so or as to the terms on which any such refinancing could be made 
shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased million in primarily as a result of the repurchase of shares  and dividends paid in offset by our net earnings 
we repurchased  shares in at an average price of per share 
on deember   we modified the existing stock repurchase plan to allow us to repurchase an additional million shares 
our existing repurchase plan  at december   had approximately million shares authorized but not yet repurchased 
in  through february th  we have repurchased  shares  at an average price of per share 
at february   we had  shares remaining to repurchase in our existing stock repurchase plan 
we increased our quarterly cash dividend to per share for the first and second quarter of  and again increased our cash dividend to per share for the third and fourth quarter of the dividend payout ratio for was  and total dividends paid during the year were million 
in february  we further increased our quarterly dividend to per share 
total dollars paid in dividends will not increase proportionately as a result of our share repurchases 
accumulated other comprehensive income increased million in primarily as a result of the increased fair market value of our mortgage related securities 
accumulated other comprehensive income reflects the difference between the net current value of securities available for sale and the book value of those securities  net of tax  and any unfunded supplemental non qualified benefit plan obligation  net of tax 
our shareholders equity to total assets ratio at december  was as compared to at december  
table of contents average balance sheet and yield rate analysis the following tables present  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets  the resultant yields  and the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made since we do not have any tax exempt investments 
average balances are derived from average daily balances 
the yield on securities available for sale is included in investment securities and mortgage related securities and yields are calculated on the historical basis 
the yields and rates are established by dividing income or expense dollars by the average balance of the asset or liability

fhlb stock is included in investment securities dollars outstanding and yields 
interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by total interest earning assets 

table of contents rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to change in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

table of contents comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and general net income was million or diluted earnings per share for as compared to million or diluted earnings per share for the decrease in net income was primarily the result of decreased net interest margin which reflects the increased cost of borrowings and deposits 
this net interest margin decrease was partially offset by an increase in total interest income which resulted from the increased yield on the loan and investment portfolio 
per share earnings decreased by a lesser percentage as a result of our share repurchases 
net interest income net interest income for decreased million  or  to million as compared to million for net interest income decreased primarily as the result of a decreased net interest margin 
the net interest margin for was as compared to for the decrease in the net interest margin for was primarily the result of the rising cost of deposits  stock repurchases  and a flattening and inversion of the yield curve 
the flattened or inverted yield curve reduces our ability to price loan offerings and reprice existing loans and investments at interest rates that would allow us to increase the yield on the loan portfolio faster than the increase in the cost of funds  thus compressing the net interest margin 
stock repurchases reduce capital which is non interest bearing by means of either borrowing an interest bearing liability or a reduction in an interest earning asset  thereby compressing the net interest margin 
total interest income total interest income for increased million  or  to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in the yield on loans and investments partially offset by a decrease in the dollar amount of their average outstanding balances 
interest income on loans increased million  or  to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in the yield on loans partially offset by a decrease in the dollar amount of their average outstanding balances 
the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio decreased million  the construction and development loan portfolio decreased million and the consumer loan portfolio decreased million  which were partially offset by the multifamily loan portfolio increase of million  the commercial real estate loan portfolio increase of million and the commercial business loans portfolio increase of million 
the average yield on the total loan portfolio increased to in from in interest income on investment securities increased million  or  as a result of increased average investment securities outstanding and by an increase in the average yield earned on those investments 
interest income on mortgage related securities increased million  or  in as a result an increase in the average yield on the mortgage related security portfolio partially offset by a decrease in the average outstanding balances in this portfolio 
although the average outstanding balance decreased  the actual balance at december  increased  this is due to purchasing new mortgage related securities later in the year 
the increase in the average yield on the mortgage related securities was the result of purchasing new mortgage related securities at interest rates that were higher than the existing yield on the portfolio 
interest income on interest earning deposits which includes federal funds sold increased  to million in as a result of the increased dollar amount in federal funds and increased yield on those interest earning deposits 
at times throughout  we increased short term investments primarily in anticipation of repurchasing additional shares of our stock 
total interest expense total interest expense increased million or to million for as compared to the increase was the result of growth in average borrowings and increased average cost of deposits and borrowings 
average deposits decreased slightly in the average cost of deposits and borrowings were in as compared to in 
table of contents interest expense on deposits increased million or to million for as compared to million for the average cost of deposits for increased to as compared to for from june through june the federal reserve federal open market committee increased the federal funds target rate times for an aggregate increase of basis points 
beginning in august  it decreased the federal funds target rate six times for an aggregate decrease of basis points 
an environment of changing interest rates can make it difficult for us to coordinate the timing and amount of changes in the rates of interest we pay such as on deposits and borrowings with the rates of interest we earn such as on loans and securities 
since the period of frequent interest rate increases and decreases began in mid  in many circumstances we have been unable to offset  in a similar time frame  the changes in the interest rates we pay with those that we earn 
interest expense on borrowings increased million or to million for as compared to million for the increase was the result of increased average cost of borrowings throughout and by an increase in average borrowings outstanding 
average borrowings increased in primarily because we repurchased our stock 
the average cost of borrowings increased in primarily as a result of increased market interest rates on new or refinanced borrowings 
provision for recovery of loan losses the provision for recovery of loan losses decreased  in primarily as a result of the repayment of one non performing loans for which a specific allowance had been established 
the total allowance for losses at december  was million  or of nonperforming loans as compared to million  or of nonperforming loans at december  the decrease was primarily the result of the loan loss recovery of a specific allowance for loss partially offset by increased net charge offs in and reduced charge offs 
net charge offs for were  as compared to  in the total loan loss allowance to total loans was at december  as compared to at the end of future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon our assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in nonperforming loans  economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimatable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowances as those portfolios carry a higher risk of loss 
see also asset quality in item  which is incorporated by reference  for certain other factors that may affect our provisions for loan losses on a go forward basis 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased million or to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily the result of increased income on bank owned life insurances and service charges on deposits partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of investments and loans 
service charges on deposits increased  in primarily as a result of increased pricing of deposit service charges partially offset by a decrease in the number of checking accounts and an increased customer utilization of on line banking and check cards 
on line banking and real time check card purchase authorizations have allowed customers to manage their accounts better and reduce their service charge fees 
brokerage and insurance commissions increased  in primarily as a result of increased customer securities and annuity sales 
loan fees and servicing revenue increased slightly in  primarily as a result of increased loan servicing fees partially offset by increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights and decreased other fees on loans 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights follows repayments or prepayments of the underlying loans so as prepayments decrease so will the amortization of mortgage servicing rights or vice versa 
there were no resulting impairments to the mortgage servicing rights in mortgage servicing rights normally become impaired from increased prepayments on mortgage loans which reduces the anticipated servicing fee income over the life of the loan 

table of contents gains loss on investments decreased million in as a result of the realization of a million other than temporary impairment on the investment in two mutual funds that invest in mortgage related securities 
real estate investment partnership income was recognized for the first time in it represents the net sales price of approximately acres of land sold by arrowood development 
the cost of sales is included in noninterest expense and the minority interest in income of real estate operations is on a separate line in the consolidated statements of income 
gains on the sales of loans increased  in as a result of increased fixed rate mortgage loan sales 
loan sales in were million as compared to million in other income increased million in primarily as the result of increased fees earned on check cards debit cards  income on bank owned life insurance which we purchased an additional million in december of  and a one time adjustment to the amortization of deferred costs as reported to us by our owned subsidiary savings financial corporation 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased million or to million in primarily as a result of increases in compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefits  occupancy and equipment and other expenses in addition to the first time recognition of the cost of sales attributable to the sale by arrowood development discussed above in the noninterest income section 
compensation expense increased  in primarily due to increases in compensation and related payroll taxes  increases in employee health insurance partially offset by the completion of vesting of stock options and restricted stock grants under the stock incentive plan in occupancy and equipment expense increased  in primarily due to increases in occupancy due to opening of new offices over the last few years  a slight increase in data processing expense partially offset by a decrease in equipment depreciation 
other expenses increased  or in  primarily as a result of increases in marketing expense and to a lesser extent miscellaneous other expenses  partially offset by a decrease in courier expense due to our changing to imaging checks and forms and transmitting them electronically to the corporate headquarters 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was  as compared to an effective tax rate of in these rates were affected by the increase in income from bank owned life insurance which is not included in taxable income and the reduction of  in  income tax expense which was primarily a result of a refund of federal income taxes paid in prior years 
like many wisconsin financial institutions  we have non wisconsin subsidiaries which hold and manage investment assets and loans  the income on which has not been subject to wisconsin tax 
the wisconsin department of revenue has instituted an audit program specifically aimed at out of state subsidiaries of wisconsin banks 
the department has asserted the position that some or all of the income of the out of state subsidiaries is taxable in wisconsin 
the department has conducted audits of many wisconsin banks  its audit of bank mutual  has not yet been concluded  although it continues to be pursued 
the department has not asserted a claim against the bank or its subsidiaries 
the department sent letters in late july to wisconsin financial institutions whether or not they were undergoing an audit reporting on settlements relating to these issues involving  at that time  financial institutions and their out of state investment subsidiaries 
the letter provided a summary of available settlement parameters 
for prior periods they include restrictions on the types of subsidiary income excluded from wisconsin taxation  assessment of certain back taxes relating to a limited time period  limitations on net operating loss carry forwards and interest on past due taxes but no penalties 
for and going forward  the letter states similar provisions  including limits on subsidiaries assets which could be considered in determining income not subject to wisconsin taxation 
as outlined  the settlement would result in the rescission of prior department letter rulings  and purport to be binding going forward except for future legislation or change by mutual agreement 
however  the letter appears 
table of contents to implicitly accept the general proposition that some out of state investment subsidiary income is not subject to wisconsin taxes 
the department s positions may be challenged by one or more financial institutions in the state 
the company has previously engaged in discussions with the department and has asked the department to consider some specific factors which the company believes may distinguish it from many other institutions 
depending upon the terms and circumstances or the outcome of potential litigation  an adverse resolution of these matters could result in additional wisconsin tax obligations for prior periods and or higher wisconsin taxes going forward  with a substantial negative impact on the earnings of bank mutual corporation 
the company believes it has reported income and paid wisconsin taxes in accordance with applicable legal requirements  and the department s long standing interpretations thereof  and that the company would likely prevail against the department should the department attempt to tax the income of our nevada subsidiaries in wisconsin 
however  we can provide no assurances of this result 
we also may incur further costs in the future to address these issues

interest income on mortgage related securities decreased million  or  in as a result of decreased average mortgage related securities outstanding  partially offset by an increase in the average yield on this portfolio 
the decrease in the average portfolio outstanding was primarily the result of using the cash flows from those securities to fund loan portfolio growth  repay borrowings or to repurchase our shares 
the increase in the average yield on the mortgage related securities was the result of purchasing new mortgage related securities at interest rates that were higher than the existing yield on the portfolio 
interest income on interest earning deposits which includes federal funds sold increased million to million in as a result of the increased dollar amount in federal funds and increased yield on those interest earning deposits 
at times throughout  we increased short term investments primarily in anticipation of paying off or reducing our borrowings or to fund loans

table of contents since june or a total of through june  after which time there have been no further increases 
however during the same period  medium and long term interest rates stayed approximately the same causing short term interest rates to be higher than the medium and long term interest rates 
this is known as an inverted yield curve 
this inversion has caused our deposit costs to increase substantially since most of deposits are priced from the short term portion of the yield curve 
in addition  competition has been strong for deposits with many competitors offering a premium interest rate to acquire deposits 
this competition made us increase our offering deposit interest rates which increased our cost on those deposits 
interest expense on borrowings increased million or to million for as compared to million for the increase was the result of increased average cost of borrowings throughout partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings outstanding 
average borrowings decreased in primarily because we repaid borrowings at times when it was economically advantageous for us to repay borrowings rather than to invest in investment securities or to originate loans 
the average cost of borrowings increased in primarily as a result of increased market interest rates on new or refinanced borrowings 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased  in primarily as a result of increased non performing loans

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of bank mutual corporation have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that we established which require us to use our judgment 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of our judgment 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  an assessment of individual problem loans and actual loss experience  current economic events in specific industries and geographical areas  including unemployment levels  and other pertinent factors  including regulatory guidance and general economic conditions 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
evaluations are conducted at least 
table of contents quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
if we misjudge a major component and experience a loss  it will likely affect our earnings 
developments affecting loans can also cause the allowance to vary significantly between quarters 
we consistently challenge ourselves in the review of the risk components to identify any changes in trends and their cause 
another valuation that requires our judgment relates to mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are recorded as an asset when loans are sold with servicing rights retained 
the total cost of loans sold is bifurcated between the loan balance and the servicing asset based on their relative fair values 
the capitalized value of mortgage servicing rights is amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net future servicing revenue 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value  adjusted for amortization  or estimated fair value 
the carrying values are periodically evaluated for impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing rights are stratified into pools based on term and interest rate 
impairment represents the excess of the remaining capitalized cost of a stratified pool over its fair value  and is recorded through a valuation allowance 
the fair value of each servicing rights pool is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate  given current market conditions 
estimates of fair value include assumptions about prepayment speeds  interest rates and other factors which are subject to change over time 
changes in these underlying assumptions could cause the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  and the related valuation allowance  if any  to change significantly in the future 
we also use our judgment in the valuation of other intangible assets core deposit base intangibles 
core deposit base intangible assets have been recorded for core deposits defined as checking  money market and savings deposits that have been acquired in acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
the core deposit base intangible assets have been recorded using the assumption that they provide a more favorable source of funding than more expensive wholesale borrowings 
an intangible asset has been recorded for the present value of the difference between the expected interest to be incurred on these deposits and interest expense that would be expected if these deposits were replaced by wholesale borrowings  over the expected lives of the core deposits 
we currently estimate the underlying core deposits have lives of seven to fifteen years 
if we find these deposits have a shorter life  we will have to write down the asset by expensing the amount that is impaired 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment  which requires the use of our judgment 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of two acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
the assessment of our tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  regulatory actions or interpretations  or changes in positions of federal and state taxing authorities will not differ from management s current assessment 
the impact of these matters could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk the bank s ability to maintain net interest income depends upon earning a higher yield on assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both our level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those with a short term to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature during a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  provides an indication of the extent to which our interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
see gap analysis below 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
instead  our real estate loan portfolio  concentrated in wisconsin  is subject to risks associated with the state and local economies 
we seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  earnings will remain within an acceptable range 
the primary objectives of our interest rate management strategy are to maintain earnings and capital within self imposed parameters over a range of possible interest rate environments  coordinate interest rate risk policies and procedures with other elements of our business plan  all within the context of the current business environment and our regulatory capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets periodically to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment and provides reports to the board of directors 
this committee is comprised of senior management 
historically  our lending activities have been concentrated in one to four family first and second mortgage loans 
our primary source of funds has been deposits and borrowings  consisting primarily of time deposits and borrowings which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio 
we have employed certain strategies to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset liability mix  including emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate and certain year fixed rate mortgage loans for our portfolio  and selling certain   and year fixed rate mortgage loans  maintaining a significant level of investment securities and mortgage related securities with a weighted average life of less than eight years or with interest rates that reprice in less than five years  and managing deposits and borrowings to provide stable funding 
we believe that the frequent repricing of our adjustable rate mortgage loans  the cash flows from our year fixed rate real estate loans  the shorter duration of our consumer loans  and adjustable rate features and shorter durations of our investment securities  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents gap analysis 
repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that specific time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   based on the assumptions below  our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period by million 
this represented a positive cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap of  and a ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year of the following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the information presented in the following table is based on the following assumptions i investment securities based upon contractual maturities and if applicable  call dates 
ii mortgage related securities based upon an independent outside source for determining cash flows prepayment speeds 
iii loans based upon contractual maturities  repricing date  if applicable  scheduled repayments of principal and projected prepayments of principal based upon our historical experience or anticipated prepayments 
iv deposits based upon contractual maturities and our historical decay rates 
v borrowings based upon the earlier of call date or final maturity

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase 

table of contents present value of equity in addition to the gap analysis table  we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk 
the model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the present value of equity is the difference between the present value of expected cash flows of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
for purposes of this table  we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table 
present value of equity as percent of present value of equity present value of assets change in dollar dollar percent present value percent interest rates amount change change ratio change basis points dollars in thousands as in the case of the gap analysis table  the methods we used in the table above have some inherent shortcomings 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we make assumptions regarding the acceleration rate of the prepayment speeds of higher yielding mortgage loans 
prepayments will accelerate in a falling rate environment and the reverse will occur in a rising rate environment 
we also assume that decay rates on core deposits will accelerate in a rising rate environment and the reverse in a falling rate environment 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates  when in practice rate changes on certain products  such as savings deposits  may lag market changes 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the present value of the equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity
