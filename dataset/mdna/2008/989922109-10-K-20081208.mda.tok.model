item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we intend for this discussion and analysis to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of september  and for the year then ended and the notes accompanying those consolidated financial statements 
executive overview we are committed to developing technologies that help advance the practice of resuscitation 
with products for pacing  defibrillation  circulation  ventilation  and fluid resuscitation  we provide a comprehensive set of technologies that help clinicians  ems professionals  and lay rescuers resuscitate sudden cardiac arrest or trauma 
table of contents victims 
we also design and market software that automates the documentation and management of both clinical and non clinical information 
we believe our recent successes continue to be attributable to multiple factors which include  in no particular order  new defibrillator products  investments made in new technologies  the breadth of product offerings and differentiated features  bolstering our distribution channels  management changes in the hospital and international markets  and benefits resulting from competitors regulatory issues 
we ended fiscal with approximately million of cash and investments and no long term debt 
we completed fiscal with record revenues of approximately million 
our sales growth was strong in all major areas of our business 
the growth was mainly due to the increased volume of professional defibrillator platform sales which include the m series product  e series and r series 
other contributors included increased volume of aeds  the lifevest product  data management products  and other resuscitation equipment including military and autopulse products 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales our net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
net sales by customer product categories were as follows s omitted change devices and accessories to the hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the pre hospital market north america other products to north america subtotal north america all products to the international market total sales our sales to the north american hospital market increased million  or  in the increase of sales to the north american hospital market was primarily due to increased volume of us military sales of approximately million  and increased volume of our professional defibrillator products to other customers of approximately million  including the m series and r series products 
the remaining increase of approximately million was due to the volume of aed sales to the north american hospital market 
our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased million  or  in the increase in pre hospital sales was due to increased volume of the lifevest product of approximately million  increased volume of professional defibrillators of approximately million  data management software products of approximately million and  to a lesser extent  increased volume of aeds and autopulse products 
international sales increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in international sales was driven by increased volume of professional defibrillator sales of million 
this growth was primarily a function of the continued success of our m series product  as our newer platforms build momentum 
other contributors to the increase included increased volume of aeds of 
table of contents approximately million  and increased volume of autopulse 
included in these increases are approximately million of benefit from foreign exchange fluctuations 
geographical areas where sales experienced significant growth included latin america and eastern europe  both with growth of approximately million  china  with growth of approximately million  and france and germany  both with growth of approximately million 
foreign exchange rates have become more volatile 
the recent  sudden strengthening of the us dollar potentially impacts us in two ways 
for sales to international distributors which are denominated in us dollars  our goods may appear more expensive 
our foreign subsidiary sales which are denominated in local currency may translate into fewer us dollar revenues 
although it is difficult to predict how foreign exchange rates will fluctuate prospectively  this sudden volatility of the us dollar may have a significantly greater impact on future results than it has historically 
total sales of the autopulse product to all our markets increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal we believe the outlook for the autopulse continues to remain strong 
gross margins cost of sales consists primarily of material  labor  overhead  and freight associated with the manufacturing of our various medical equipment devices  data collection software and disposable electrodes 
these products are primarily sold to the hospital  pre hospital  and international markets 
we sell data collection software  mainly to the pre hospital market 
our consolidated gross margin may fluctuate considerably depending on unit volume levels  mix of product and customer class activity levels  and overall market conditions 
overall  gross margins for fiscal decreased to approximately compared to in fiscal a low margin california order  which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal  accounts for approximately percentage point of the decrease in gross margin 
to a lesser extent  the margin was also unfavorably affected by increased international sales  which carry lower than average margins 
offsetting the decrease in the overall gross margin was the favorable effect of the lifevest product which carries higher than average margin 
other than the impact of the california order  each of the remaining factors causing the fluctuation in gross margin represents less than a percentage point of our overall gross margin 
backlog we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million 
our backlog did not grow in the fourth quarter as it typically has  which we believe is indicative of the current economic environment which may have caused capital spending to be constrained 
we believe we need to maintain a permanent backlog level of orders that will not be shipped at the end of each quarter 
we believe this will help us improve our efficiency  lower our costs and improve our profitability as it will make it less likely that we will be required to incur substantial additional costs at the end of the quarter 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily an accurate predictor of revenue for any succeeding period 
costs and expenses operating expenses were as follows s omitted of sales of sales change selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total expenses 
table of contents selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the same period last year 
approximately million of the increase related to increased personnel related costs  including salaries  commissions and stock based compensation for selling and marketing employees 
the remaining increase primarily relates to increases in selling and marketing personnel travel and tradeshow expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues as we have been able to achieve greater efficiency with our sales organization and marketing efforts as our revenue has grown 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the previous year 
approximately million of the increase related to increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for general and administrative employees 
research and development expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase related to increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for research and development employees 
other contributors include increased clinical trial work related to the autopulse and lifevest 
investment and other income expense investment and other income expense decreased to  in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease reflected foreign exchange losses on marking our foreign denominated intercompany receivable balances to the spot rate at the end of the year  lower average interest rates and a  reserve on certain investments in mortgage backed and auction rate securities 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to compared to in fiscal the decreased rate resulted from an increase in the section deduction production deduction benefit from in fiscal to in fiscal along with a decision made in the fourth quarter of fiscal not to provide us taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
these benefits were partially offset by the expiration of a research and development credit at december   allowing only one quarter of benefit in fiscal subsequent to our fiscal year end  congress has extended the research and development credit through december  the benefit from this congressional action will be recognized in fiscal effective october   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized approximately  of increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
all of this increase was reflected as a reduction to the october  balance of retained earnings 
at the adoption date of october   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  which  if recognized  would affect goodwill and our effective tax rate 
at september   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  all of which  if recognized  would affect goodwill and our effective tax rate 
we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
we have concluded all us federal and most state and foreign income tax matters through fiscal we do not currently have any income tax audits in progress and  therefore  foresee little change in our current reserve for uncertain tax positions in the next twelve months 
our historical practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
we had  accrued for interest and penalties at the time of the adoption of fin and  at september  we currently estimate that our fiscal effective tax rate will be approximately 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales our net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
net sales by customer product categories were as follows s omitted change devices and accessories to the hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the pre hospital market north america other products to north america subtotal north america all products to the international market total sales our sales to the north american hospital market increased million  or  in the increase of sales to the north american hospital market was primarily due to increased volume of our professional defibrillator products of approximately million  including the m series and the new r series product and a million higher volume of aed sales 
this increase was  offset by a lower volume of us military sales for of approximately million as compared to our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased million  or  in north american pre hospital results also include the results of zoll lifecor the assets of which were acquired in april for a full twelve months in fiscal as opposed to only six months in fiscal other factors contributing to the increase include increased volume of aeds of approximately million and data management software products of approximately million in the pre hospital market and  to a lesser extent  increased volume of professional defibrillators and autopulse products 
international sales increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in international sales was driven by increased volume of professional defibrillator sales 
the growth was primarily a function of the continued success of our m series product  as our newer platforms are still relatively early in their sales cycles 
other contributors to the increase included increased volume of autopulse and aeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
geographical areas where sales experienced significant growth included the united kingdom  approximately million  russia and germany  approximately million each  and eastern europe  middle east  and netherlands  approximately million each 
total sales of the autopulse product to all our markets increased by approximately million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal gross margins overall  gross margins for fiscal remained relatively flat at approximately compared to fiscal gross margins were favorably affected in fiscal by the mix of the results of zoll lifecor which was acquired in april  and an increase in sales of data management software  which carries higher than average margins 
the favorable impact was offset by increased international sales  which carry lower than average margins  and sales of our autopulse product  which currently carries a lower than average margin due to current low production volumes 
each of the factors describing the fluctuation in gross margin represents less than a percentage point of our overall gross margin 

table of contents backlog we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million  which includes approximately million related to our california homeland security order  as we typically build a backlog in the fourth quarter 
all of this backlog shipped during fiscal due to possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily an accurate predictor of revenue for any succeeding period 
costs and expenses operating expenses were as follows s omitted of sales of sales change selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total expenses selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the previous year 
approximately million of the increase related to increased personnel related costs  including salaries  commissions and stock based compensation for selling and marketing employees 
the inclusion of expenses related to the zoll lifecor business  following the april asset acquisition  accounted for approximately million of this increase as these expenses were included for only six months of the prior year 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues as we have been able to achieve greater efficiency with our related sales organization and marketing efforts as our revenue has grown 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the previous year 
the inclusion of expenses related to the zoll lifecor business  following the april asset acquisition  accounted for approximately million of this increase as these expenses were included for only six months of the prior year 
other contributors included million of increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for general and administrative employees 
research and development expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the previous year 
approximately million of the increase related to increased clinical trial work as we initiated a new clinical trial related to the autopulse 
other contributors included million of increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for research and development employees 
the inclusion of expenses related to the business of zoll lifecor also accounted for approximately  of this increase as these expenses were included for only six months of the prior year 
investment and other income investment and other income increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous year 
this increase was due to the increase in interest earned as a result of increased cash balances maintained for a majority of the fiscal year and increased foreign currency exchange gains compared to the prior year 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal and was a provision of 
the rate was negatively affected by the elimination of the deduction for extraterritorial income  which was available only for the first quarter of fiscal it was positively affected by the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development 
table of contents credit in fiscal as part of the tax relief and health care act of this act not only provided us with a full fiscal year benefit of the research and development credit in  it also allowed us to book the tax credits related to r d expenses incurred in our last three fiscal quarters of financial condition liquidity and capital resources our overall financial condition continues to remain strong 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments at september  totaled million compared with million at september  we continue to have no long term debt 
as we have previously discussed  with the january suspension of us shipments from the medtronic physio control unit  we have used cash  and it is possible we will use additional cash to assist customers who transition to our products with various financing arrangements 
cash requirements we believe that the combination of existing cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid marketable securities on hand  along with cash to be generated by future operations and amounts available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
sources and uses of cash to assist with the discussion  the following table presents the abbreviated cash flows for the years ended september   september   and october  s omitted net cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of year cash and cash equivalents end of year operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal to million compared to million in this increase in cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash required for inventory of approximately million compared to the prior year 
the increase in inventory purchases in fiscal relative to fiscal includes the impact of building inventory to support higher levels of business  including approximately million related to our california homeland security order  new product offerings  such as the r series  additional order activity related to the continued suspension of us shipments by our largest competitor  and evaluation units 
other factors having a positive effect on operating activities include increased collections of accounts receivable compared to the prior year and an increase in net income of million 
this increase was partially offset by the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses 

table of contents investing activities cash used in investing activities increased approximately million in fiscal to million as compared to million in the prior year 
this increasing use of cash was primarily attributable to the increase in net purchases of marketable securities during the fiscal year of approximately million 
this increase in investing activities was partially offset by the decrease in acquisition related payments in fiscal as the assets of bio key international and radiant corporation were purchased in fiscal property and equipment additions for fiscal totaled approximately million  which is consistent with prior year additions 
we anticipate additions for fiscal to be consistent with fiscal financing activities cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal in comparison to approximately million in the previous year 
the change reflects a lower number of stock options exercised during approximately  shares in and  shares in at a higher weighted average exercise price per share in and in 
similarly  the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options decreased from million in the previous year to million for fiscal  due to the lower number of stock options exercised during investments in march  we acquired substantially all the assets of infusion dynamics 
under the terms of the acquisition  we are obligated to make additional earn out payments through contingencies based on performance of the acquired business 
because additional consideration is based on the growth of sales  a reasonable estimate of the future payments to be made cannot be determined 
as these contingencies are resolved and the consideration is distributable  we record the fair value of the additional consideration as additional cost of the acquired assets 
our earn out payments  in the form of cash  for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively 
we have accrued  but not yet paid  an earn out for of approximately  which is expected to be paid in cash during the first quarter of fiscal we exercised our option to acquire revivant  the manufacturer of the autopulse  on october  we paid million in the form of cash and shares of our common stock as the initial merger consideration 
additional contingent consideration under the merger agreement was dependent upon certain clinical developments milestone payments and increases in revenue through fiscal earn out payments 
in january  we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of common stock in payment of the earn out  which was accrued during fiscal  to the former shareholders of revivant 
in december  we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of common stock in payment of the fiscal earn out  which was accrued during fiscal  to the former shareholders of revivant 
the december payment represented the contingent consideration due to the former shareholders of revivant for the final earn out period related to this acquisition 
we exercised our option to acquire the business and assets of lifecor on march  and acquired the business and assets on april  we assumed lifecor s outstanding debt plus an additional million owed to us  which was cancelled and certain stated liabilities 
we paid the third party debt in april we agreed to pay additional consideration in the form of earn out payments to lifecor based upon future revenue growth of the acquired business over a five year period 
earn out payments to lifecor were made in the form of cash for fiscal and fiscal in the approximate amounts of  and million  respectively 
for both annual earn outs  the additional consideration was accrued during the fiscal period when earned and paid out in the subsequent fiscal period 
we have accrued  but not yet paid  an earn out for of approximately million  which is expected to be paid in cash during the first quarter of fiscal because additional consideration will be based on the growth of sales  a reasonable estimate of the total acquisition cost cannot be determined 

table of contents on may   we acquired the fire records management software business and related assets from bio key international  inc for approximately million in cash 
under terms of the acquisition  no additional consideration will be paid 
on september   we acquired certain assets from radiant medical  inc  a private medical technology company developing endovascular temperature therapy products  for approximately million in cash 
under the terms of the acquisition  no additional consideration will be paid 
we recently announced a strategic alliance with welch allyn involving research and development  manufacturing  sales  service  and distribution related to welch allyn s defibrillator and monitoring products 
we anticipate that the elements of the strategic alliance will be implemented over the next several months upon completion of certain milestones 
total consideration for all elements could approximate million 
debt instruments and related covenants we maintain an unsecured working capital line of credit with our bank 
under this working capital line  we may borrow  on a demand basis  up to million 
this line of credit bears interest at the bank s rate of libor plus for short term borrowings months 
for longer term loans  the line of credit bears interest at the rate of libor plus 
no borrowings were outstanding on this line during fiscal there are no covenants related to this line of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements consist of non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and one minimum purchase commitment contract for a critical raw material component 
the table below in the next section titled contractual obligations and other commercial commitments shows the amounts of our operating lease commitments and purchase commitments payable by year 
for liquidity purposes  in general  we choose to lease our facilities instead of purchasing them 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in s total less than year years years after years non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the company leases certain office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the company s office leases are subject to adjustments based on actual floor space occupied 
the leases also require payment of real estate taxes and operating costs 
in addition to the office leases  the company leases automobiles for business use by a portion of the sales force 
the company s executive headquarters and defibrillator and power infuser manufacturing operations are located in chelmsford  massachusetts 
the chelmsford facility is covered by an eight year lease  beginning july  and expiring on june  the agreement does not contain a renewal period and provides that 
table of contents the company pay a pro rata amount of the landlord s real estate tax and operating expenses based upon square footage 
the lease also provided the company with an allowance of approximately million for any construction costs associated with their relocation efforts to the leased facility 
this reimbursement has been recorded as a deferred lease incentive within accrued expenses and other liabilities and is being amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the life of the lease 
any leasehold improvements made as part of the relocation have been capitalized as leasehold improvements within property and equipment and are being amortized over the eight year life of the lease 
purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts that are non cancelable 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based upon our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon future performance and growth of sales are not included in the table above 
these include the additional earn out payments for the assets of infusion dynamics and lifecor through fiscal because all of these earn out payments are based upon the growth of sales over several years  a reasonable estimate of the future payment obligations cannot be determined 
critical accounting estimates our management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  even though in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make certain estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and to make difficult and subjective judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
our most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition  and our most critical accounting estimates include accounts receivable reserves  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  the valuation of long lived assets and stock based compensation 
management continually reviews its accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies  which include revenue recognition and those that require significant estimates and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of cardiac resuscitation devices  disposable electrodes and accessories are recognized when a signed non cancelable purchase order exists  the product is shipped  title and risk have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
circumstances that generally preclude the immediate recognition of revenue include shipping terms of fob destination or the existence of a customer acceptance clause in a contract based upon customer inspection of the product 
in these instances  revenue is deferred until adequate documentation is obtained to ensure that these criteria have been fulfilled 
similarly  revenues from the sales of our products to distributors fall under the same guidelines 
for all significant orders placed by our distributors  we require an approved purchase order  we perform a credit review  and we ensure that the terms on the purchase order or contract are proper and do not include any contingencies which preclude revenue recognition 
we do not typically offer any special right of return  stock rotation or price protection to our distributors or end customers 

table of contents our sales to customers often include a cardiac resuscitation device  disposable electrodes and other accessories 
for the vast majority of our shipments  all deliverables are shipped together 
in cases where some elements of a multiple element arrangement are not delivered as of a reporting date  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and only recognize the revenue related to the delivered elements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns 
some sales to customers of our cardiac resuscitation devices may include some data collection software 
the cardiac resuscitation device and software product can operate independently of each other and one does not affect the functionality of the other 
in cases where both elements are included in a customer s order but only one has been delivered by the reporting date and fair value for the undelivered element can be established  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element and recognize the revenue related to the delivered item in accordance with eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software and eitf we also license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including training  installation  consulting and maintenance  which consists of product support services and unspecified upgrade rights collectively  post contract customer support pcs 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and related literature 
license fee revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues from maintenance agreements and upgrade rights are recognized ratably over the period of service 
revenue for services  such as software deployment and consulting  is recognized when the service is performed 
our software arrangements contain multiple elements  which include software products  services and pcs 
generally  we do not sell computer hardware products with our software products 
we will occasionally facilitate the hardware purchase by providing information to the customer such as where to purchase the equipment 
we generally do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our software products 
we do  however  have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for items such as consulting and technical services  deployment and pcs based upon the price charged when such items are sold separately 
accordingly  for transactions where vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements but not for delivered elements  we use the residual method as discussed in sop  modification of sop under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we do not typically ship any of our software products to distributors or resellers 
our software products are sold by our sales force directly to the end user 
we may sell software to system integrators who provide complete solutions to end users on a contract basis 
in each of the years in the three year period ended september   software revenue did not exceed of our total revenues 
we also rent our lifevest product to customers on a monthly basis once a physician prescribes the lifevest to their patients 
the lifevest product is reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or other third party payers 
revenue is recognized ratably over the service period once we have evidence of an arrangement  the lifevest has been delivered to the patient  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were awarded a contract of approximately million with a contractor hired by the state of california to supply defibrillators and accessories 
the contract also includes preventative maintenance and storage services for certain defibrillators and accessories over a five year period 
based on the award  we shipped the defibrillators and accessories equipment in three installments over the course of four months beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and ending in the first quarter of fiscal title and risk of loss for this equipment passed to the customer upon shipment 
at the request of the state of 
table of contents california  the equipment was shipped to three warehouse locations within california in order to provide for rapid deployment in the case of an emergency 
two of the warehouses are facilities leased by us on their behalf 
as a result  the state of california requested that we make arrangements to store and maintain certain of the equipment to ensure proper performance when deployed 
we considered the specific guidance and criteria for bill and hold arrangements as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
and concluded we have complied with all of the criteria for revenue recognition 
the preventative maintenance services include preventative maintenance on the defibrillator units as well as battery and electrode replacement upon expiration of their shelf life within the five year period of the contract 
although we delivered the first installment of the equipment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  no revenue was recognized because objective and reliable evidence of fair value did not exist for all undelivered elements 
we recognized approximately million of revenue related to the delivered equipment in fiscal  because we believe that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all remaining undelivered elements  including maintenance  storage  insurance and accessories 
the remaining amount of consideration will be recognized over a five year period as the undelivered elements are delivered 
in fiscal  we began performance under a state of readiness contract awarded by the us government to supply defibrillators on short notice 
based on the award  we received two types of payments from the us government 
the first payment of approximately million was to reimburse us for the cost to acquire inventories required to meet potentially short notice delivery schedules 
this payment is carried within deferred revenue on our balance sheet as a liability 
we also received a payment from the us government to compensate us for managing the purchase  build  storage and inventory rotation process 
this payment also compensated us for making future production capacity available 
the portion of this payment associated with the purchase and build aspects of the contract was recognized on a percentage of completion basis while the portion of the payment for the storage  inventory rotation and facilities charge was recognized ratably over the contract period 
this government contract is for a one year term  and the us government has four one year extension options that require the payment of additional fees to us if exercised the contract is currently in its fourth and final extension 
these fees are for the storage  inventory rotation and facilities charge and are recognized ratably over the contract period 
the us government has two options to acquire defibrillators under this contract 
they may buy on a replenishment basis  which means we will record a sale under our normal us government price list and maintain our state of readiness  or they may buy on a non replenishment basis  which will still allow us to obtain normal margins but will reduce our future obligations under this arrangement 
for information concerning the accounting treatment of trade in allowances  see the next section allowance for doubtful accounts sales returns and allowances trade in allowances 
for those markets for which we sell separately priced extended warranties  revenue is deferred and recognized over the applicable warranty period  based upon the fair value of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts sales returns and allowances trade in allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  for which related provisions are included in bad debt expense  resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
specifically identified reserves are charged to selling and marketing expenses 
provisions for general reserves are charged to general and administrative expenses 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  communications with the customers  credit history and current economic conditions 
we also maintain an estimated reserve for potential future product returns and 
table of contents discounts given related to trade ins and to current period product sales  which is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included in the sales returns and allowance accounts on our balance sheet 
as of september   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances of million 
we believe our reported allowances at september  are adequate 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we might need to record additional allowances  resulting in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination would be made 
although we are not typically contractually obligated to provide trade in allowances under existing sales contracts  we may offer such allowances when negotiating new sales arrangements 
when pricing sales transactions  we contemplate both cash consideration and the net realizable value of any used equipment to be traded in 
the trade in allowance value stated in a sales order may differ from the estimated net realizable value of the underlying equipment 
any excess in the trade in allowance over the estimated net realizable value of the used equipment represents additional sales discount 
we account for product sales transactions by recording as revenue the total of the cash consideration and the estimated net realizable value of the trade in equipment less a normal profit margin 
any difference between the estimated net realizable value of the used equipment and the trade in allowance granted is recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the sale 
used zoll equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or market consistent with accounting research bulletin no 
arb 
we regularly review our reserves to assure that the balance sheet value associated with our trade in equipment is properly stated 
if the trade in equipment is a competitor s product  we will usually resell the product to a third party distributor who specializes in sale of used medical equipment  without any refurbishment 
we typically do not recognize a profit upon the resale of a competitor s used equipment  although as a result of the inherent nature of the estimation process  we could recognize either a nominal gain or loss 
warranty reserves our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  usually one year for pre hospital and international customers and five years for hospital customers 
revenue is deferred for pre hospital customers who receive warranties beyond one year 
such revenue is then recognized over the period of extended warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the costs that we estimate include material  labor  and shipping 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at september  is adequate to cover future costs for the servicing of our products sold through that date and under warranty 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated  obsolete  or because the amount on hand is in excess of future needs 
we provide for the total value of inventories that we determine

we estimate excess inventory amounts by reviewing quantities on hand and comparing those quantities to sales forecasts for the next months  identifying historical service usage trends  and matching that usage with the installed base quantities to estimate future needs 
at september   our inventory was recorded at net realizable value requiring adjustments of million  or of our million gross inventories 
goodwill at september   we had approximately million in goodwill  primarily resulting from our acquisitions of revivant approximately million  certain assets of bio key international  inc approximately million  the assets of infusion dynamics approximately million  and the assets of lifecor approximately million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
fair value is determined based on an estimate of the discounted future cash flows expected from the reporting units 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment on the part of management about future revenues  expenses and other assumptions that contribute to the net cash flows of the reporting units 
additionally  we periodically review our goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment has occurred 
long lived assets we periodically review the carrying amount of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets  to assess potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the determination includes evaluation of factors such as current market value  business climate and future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related assets 
fair value is determined based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in assessing potential impairment and to record an impairment loss based on fair value in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
this process requires judgment on the part of management 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a result of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which the determination is made 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on october  fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

r  share based payment sfas r  beginning october   using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires the company to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize cost over the requisite service period 
under the modified prospective transition method  financial statements for periods prior to the date of adoption are not adjusted for the change in accounting

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have cash equivalents and marketable securities that primarily consist of money market accounts and fixed rate  asset backed corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities within one to five years 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the term and type of our investments and that the fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have international subsidiaries in canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  france  germany  austria  australia  and new zealand 
these subsidiaries transact business in their functional or local currency 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our currency transaction exposures 
these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow  fair value or net investment hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas and therefore  are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings 
these derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk since gains and losses on those derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
we had one forward exchange contract outstanding serving as a hedge of our euro intercompany receivables in the notional amount of approximately million euros at september  the contract serves as a hedge of a substantial portion of our euro denominated intercompany balances 
the fair value of this contract at september  was approximately million  resulting in an unrealized gain of  a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of the euro derivative foreign exchange contract outstanding at september  indicates that  if the us dollar weakened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would decrease by approximately million resulting in a total loss on the contract of approximately  conversely  if the us dollar strengthened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would increase by approximately  resulting in a total gain on the contract approximately of million 
any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contract would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transaction

because these derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas  the company subsequently entered into offsetting derivatives totaling million 
all of the contracts have been marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings
