table of contents we repurchased about million shares of our common stock for a total of billion under our share repurchase programs in fiscal which underscores our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders 
in fiscal  we focused on three critical areas to restore the health of the company simplifying the business and holding each brand accountable to its priorities  managing our inventory with discipline to enable growth in gross margin and gross profit  and focusing on product and target customers  specifically at gap and old navy 
this work helped us increase net earnings and has created the important groundwork for our future 
in fiscal  we will focus on four priorities driving earnings through inventory discipline which supports improved gross margin  continuing cost management  improving return on invested capital  and continuing to focus on product across all brands 
we remain committed to returning excess cash to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases

interest expense percentage of net sales in millions weeks ended february  weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended february  weeks ended february  weeks ended january  interest expense the decrease of million in interest expense for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to the maturity of our million  percent notes repaid in september and reduction of interest accruals resulting from the resolutions of tax audits and outstanding tax contingencies completed in fiscal the decrease of million in interest expense for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to lower debt levels as a result of our march redemption of convertible notes

the decrease in interest income for fiscal  compared with fiscal  is due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as well as a lower interest rate environment 
income taxes percentage of net sales in millions weeks ended february  weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended february  weeks ended february  weeks ended january  income taxes effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily driven by the impact of changes in state tax laws 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily driven by the absence of the favorable tax settlement realized in related to the us japan income tax treaty 
gap inc form k 
table of contents we currently expect the fiscal effective tax rate to be about percent 
the actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables  including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations  the overall level of earnings  and the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies

loss from the discontinued operation on a pre tax basis for fiscal included million related to the impairment of long lived assets  million of lease settlement charges  million of employee severance  million of net sublease losses and million of administrative and other costs 
financial condition liquidity we consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years in millions weeks ended as of february  weeks ended as of february  weeks ended as of january  working capital a current ratio a net cash provided by operating activities a our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash 
our working capital and current ratio as of february  decreased compared with february  due primarily to decreases in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and merchandise inventory  and an increase in accounts payable 
we believe that cash flows from our operations and our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases  personnel related expenses  and payment of taxes and occupancy 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared with fiscal  primarily due to higher net earnings  a decrease in inventory purchases as a result of our continued focus on inventory management  an increase in accounts payable due to a change in vendor payment terms and lower income taxes paid in fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared with fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings  higher prepaid taxes and higher inventory levels  offset by an increase in accrued expenses 
inventory management remains an area of focus 
we continue to execute against our strategies of managing inventory levels in a manner that supports more selling at regular price and healthy merchandise margins 
as a result  inventory per square foot at february  was  compared with inventory per square foot of at february  and at january  we fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  peaking over a total of about thirteen weeks during the gap inc form k 
table of contents back to school and holiday periods 
during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  these periods accounted for percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our annual net sales 
the seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods 
as part of our normal business practices  we periodically benchmark vendor payment terms within our industry 
based upon this review  we determined that there was an opportunity to modify our merchandise vendor payment terms to be more in line with our competitors 
this change became effective in september and  as a result  we have an extended time to pay 
cash flows from investing activities our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures  while cash inflows are primarily the result of proceeds from maturities of short term investments 
net cash used for investing activities for fiscal increased million compared with fiscal in fiscal and  capital expenditures totaled million and million  respectively 
the majority of these expenditures in both fiscal years were used for new store locations  store remodels and information technology 
in fiscal  we had net maturities of short term investments of million compared with net maturities of short term investments of million in fiscal net cash used for investing activities for fiscal was million compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal this million decrease was driven by the release of million of restricted cash in fiscal as a result of the amendment to our letter of credit agreement  partially offset by million more cash provided by net maturities of investments in fiscal for fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be about million 
we expect to open about new store locations and to close about store locations 
these openings and closings include store repositions 
as a result  we expect net square footage to increase less than half a percent for fiscal cash flows from financing activities our cash outflows related to financing activities consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock  repayment of debt  and dividend payments  while cash inflows typically consist of proceeds from share based compensation 
during fiscal  we paid billion for the repurchase of approximately million shares compared with repurchases of approximately million shares for billion in fiscal we also repaid our percent notes payable of million in september for fiscal  cash flows used for financing activities decreased million compared with fiscal driven by repurchases of billion less common stock than in fiscal free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap measure 
we believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available after the deduction of capital expenditures  as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business 
we use this metric internally  as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation 
however  this non gaap financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our gaap results 
in fiscal  we delivered billion in free cash flow  which represented percent of net earnings  compared with million in fiscal the increase was driven primarily by lower inventory levels and the change in vendor payment terms

credit facilities the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay the vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped 
vendor payables are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer  although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this 
as of february   our letter of credit agreements consist of two separate million  three year  unsecured letter of credit agreements for a total aggregate availability of million and a scheduled termination date of may as of february   we had million in trade letters of credit issued under these letter of credit agreements 
we also have a million  five year  unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in august the new facility 
the new facility is available for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper backstop  working capital  trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
the facility usage fees and fees related to the new facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio 
if we were to draw on the facility  interest would be a base rate typically the london interbank offered rate plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount 
to maintain availability of funds under the revolving credit facility  we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount  regardless of usage 
as of february   there were no borrowings under the new facility 
the new facility and letter of credit agreements contain financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the new facility and letter of credit agreements  which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the new facility for letters of credit and advances  terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements  require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the new facility  and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements 
in addition  such a default could  under certain circumstance  permit the holders of our outstanding unsecured debt to accelerate payment of such obligations

other cash obligations not reflected in consolidated balance sheets the majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores 
commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases

the services agreement has an initial term of ten years  and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years 
we have various options to terminate the agreement  and we will pay ibm under a combination of fixed and variable charges  with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services 
based on the current projection of service needs  we expect to pay approximately million to ibm over the remaining eight years of the contract 
the services agreement has performance levels that ibm must meet or exceed 
if these service levels are not met  we would in certain circumstances receive a credit against the charges otherwise due  have the right to other interim remedies  or as to material breaches have the right to terminate the services agreement 
in addition  the agreement provides us certain pricing protections  and we have the right to terminate the services agreement both for cause and for convenience subject  in the case of termination for convenience  to our payment of a termination fee 
ibm also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure 
we have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of february  under these arrangements  we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligation

the maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately million as of february  the fair value of the guarantees was not material as of february  we are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements and various other agreements 
under these contracts we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties eg  ownership of assets  environmental or tax indemnifications or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
generally  the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and  as a result  the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability  we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of million  of which million has already been cash collateralized 
we are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool 
our maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance pool diminishes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large  global corporation 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
for additional information  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gap inc form k 
table of contents our significant accounting policies can be found in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors  and the audit and finance committee of our board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
merchandise inventory we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost 
our markdown reserve calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns  which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise  inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand and the promotional environment 
in addition  we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
historically  actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown or inventory shortage reserves 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be affected 
impairment of long lived assets and excess facilities we have a significant investment in property and equipment 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the carrying value of long lived assets  including lease rights and key money  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store  headquarter facility  or distribution center  or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset 
for assets that are identified as potentially being impaired  if the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value of the asset is estimated using the discounted future cash flows of the assets based upon a rate commensurate with the risk 
our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and costs and useful lives of the assets 
estimating the fair value further requires selecting the discount rate and other factors affecting the valuation of asset fair values  and is based upon our experience  knowledge and third party data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
the decision to close or sublease a store  headquarter facility  or distribution center can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised remaining useful life of the long lived asset 
in addition  we record a charge and corresponding sublease loss reserve for the net present value of the difference between the contractual rent obligations and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties 
we estimate the reserve based on the status of our efforts to lease vacant office space and stores  including a review of real estate market conditions  our projections for sublease income and sublease commencement assumptions 
most store closures occur upon the lease expiration 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses or the sublease loss reserve 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations  we may be exposed to losses that could be material

table of contents insurance and self insurance we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers compensation  general liability  and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our employees 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts  and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes  health care costs  and claim settlement patterns 
historically  actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
revenue recognition while revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment  it represents an important accounting policy for the company 
we recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers 
for store sales  revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register  primarily with either cash or credit card 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise 
we record an allowance for estimated returns based on estimated gross profit using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
unredeemed gift cards upon the purchase of a gift card or issuance of a gift certificate  a liability is established for its cash value 
the liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer 
over time  some portion of the gift cards issued is not redeemed 
this amount is recorded as other income  which is a component of operating expenses  when it can be determined that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions 
we determine the probability of the gift card being redeemed to be remote based on historical gift card redemption patterns 
historically  actual redemption patterns have not been materially different from our estimates 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
for stock options  we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires assumptions requiring a high degree of judgment 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield 
for stock options and other stock awards  we also estimate the forfeiture rate which is the number of stock awards that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings 
income taxes on february   we adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

to the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
we also record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate in foreign countries  which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations and forecasted royalty payments using foreign exchange forward contracts 
we also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany loans and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding or issuing the intercompany loan or balance 
these contracts are entered into with large  reputable financial institutions  which are monitored for counterparty risk 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were the euro  british pound  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management  we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
additional information is presented in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we also use forward contracts to hedge the net assets of an international subsidiary to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investment in that subsidiary 
the change in fair value of the forward contracts is reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on the investment 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of february  and february   based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar with all other variables held constant on our underlying exposure  net of derivative financial instruments 
the foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at february  and february  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure  net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments  of million at february  and million at february  we have limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
we use a cross currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable of million debt securities of our japanese subsidiary  gap japan kk  due march  from a fixed interest rate of percent  payable in us dollars  to billion japanese yen with a fixed interest rate of percent 
these debt securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their issuance amount  net of unamortized discount 
the fair value of this long term debt was million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
the interest on our million notes payable due december  of which only million remains outstanding  is subject to increase decrease by percent for each rating downgrade upgrade of our long term senior unsecured debt ratings by rating agencies 
the interest payable by us on the notes was percent per annum as of february  the fair value of the notes payable as of february  and february  was million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments classified as cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
primarily all securities held are us government and agency securities  domestic commercial paper  and bank securities and are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
an increase in interest rates of percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments 
however  declines in interest rates would decrease the interest income derived from our investments 
we earned interest income of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively
