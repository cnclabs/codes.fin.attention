overview cubist is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in lexington  massachusetts  focused on the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs in the acute care environment 
to date  we have concentrated exclusively on developing products for the anti infective marketplace 
we have one marketed product  cubicin  which was launched in the us in november cubicin is currently the only marketed once daily  bactericidal  intravenous iv antibiotic with activity against methicillin resistant s 
aureus  or mrsa 
cubicin is approved in the us for the treatment of csssi  caused by s 
aureus and certain other gram positive bacteria  and for s 
aureus bloodstream infections bacteremia  including those with right sided infective endocarditis  caused by methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant isolates 
in the eu  cubicin is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections  or cssti  where the presence of susceptible gram positive bacteria is confirmed or suspected 
in september  the marketing authorization for the cubicin label in the eu was expanded to include right sided infective endocarditis  or rie  due to s 
aureus bacteremia associated with rie or cssti 
net product sales of cubicin for the twelve months ended december  were million  as compared to million in the twelve months ended december  net income for the twelve months ended december  was million or and per basic and diluted share  respectively  as compared to a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share for the twelve months ended december in december  cubist acquired illumigen pursuant to its october option agreement 
per the merger agreement  cubist agreed to pay million  plus illumigen s closing cash and less illumigen s closing liability balances  in cash to illumigen shareholders  and illumigen became a wholly owned subsidiary of cubist 
illumigen s lead compound  ib  is a protein therapeutic in late stage pre clinical development as an interferon sparing agent for the treatment of hcv infections 
cubist has evaluated whether the illumigen acquisition meets the criteria of a business as outlined in emerging issues task force  or eitf   determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business  and has concluded that the entity did not qualify as a business 
accordingly  we accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of assets 
the total costs associated with the acquisition were million and include the closing cash consideration paid to illumigen shareholders  the option agreement payment of million made in october  transaction costs of million  and million of costs paid by cubist during the option period related to an ind enabling study of ib and illumigen s operating costs during the option period 
the total consideration was allocated to net tangible assets acquired of million  consisting primarily of cash  ipr d of million and research and development expense of million 
the ipr d represents the value assigned to the ib compound  and is included in research and development expense for the year ended december  we expect to file an ind for ib in the second half of cubist will make additional payments to the former illumigen shareholders of up to million if certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved during the development of ib as a therapy for hcv 
in addition  if cubist develops an illumigen product for the treatment of viral infections other than hcv  additional development and regulatory milestone payments of up to million would apply 
if illumigen product s are commercialized  sales milestones of up to million  as well as tiered royalties  would apply 
in march  we entered into a license agreement with merck for the development and commercialization of cubicin in japan  the last country outside the us for which cubist did not have a partner for the distribution of cubicin 
merck will develop and commercialize cubicin through its wholly owned subsidiary  banyu pharmaceutical co  ltd  or banyu 
in exchange for the development and commercialization rights in japan  merck paid us million cash upfront 
this million was recorded as deferred revenue  and will be recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period of the agreement 
we may receive up to an additional million in total milestone payments if merck reaches certain regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  merck will purchase finished but unlabeled vials of cubicin from us in exchange for a transfer price 
in july  kuhnil pharmaceutical corp  or kuhnil  our cubicin marketing partner for south korea  and tty biopharm company  ltd  our cubicin marketing partner for taiwan  received approvals for s 
aureus bacteremia  including rie  in both south korea and taiwan  respectively 
the approval in south korea includes both csssi and s 
aureus bacteremia  including rie 
cubicin was previously approved in taiwan for csssi caused by gram positive bacteria 
in september  oryx pharmaceuticals  inc  our cubicin marketing partner in canada  received approval for csssi and s 
aureus bacteremia 
oryx formally launched cubicin in canada in january we continue to sell cubicin in the us in accordance with our drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this provides us with greater visibility into end user ordering and reordering trends 
we outsource many of our supply chain activities  including i manufacturing and supplying cubicin api  ii converting cubicin api into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation  iii managing warehousing and distribution of cubicin to our customers  and iv performing the order processing  order fulfillment  shipping  collection and invoicing services related to our cubicin product sales 
we have focused our pipeline building efforts on opportunities that leverage our anti infective and acute care discovery  development  regulatory  and commercialization expertise 
currently  we have multiple anti infective programs approaching the ind filing stage preparatory to clinical trials 
since our inception  we have incurred net losses in every fiscal period until the third quarter of principally as a result of research and development efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  and administrative costs 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million

the increase in product revenues was primarily due to increased us customer volume  as well as a price increase in january international revenues for the years ended december  and consisted primarily of product sales to novartis 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and out patient administration location purchases of our product

we also issued  shares of our common stock valued at million in as a milestone payment to eli lilly 
these amounts have been capitalized on our balance sheet as intangible assets and are amortized to cost of product revenues over the remaining life of our license agreement with eli lilly 
amortization included in cost of product revenues related to these items was million for the years ended december  and as our production volumes increase  there is the potential for our gross margin to increase as we work to develop manufacturing process improvements 
whether that potential can be realized and the extent to which such potential can be realized are uncertain

we continue to monitor the available information in determining whether there is sufficient positive evidence to consider releasing the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets 
should we determine the valuation allowance is no longer required  a tax benefit would be recorded in the financial period of the change in determination

liquidity and capital resources currently  we require cash to fund our working capital needs  to purchase capital assets  and to pay our debt service  including principal  interest and capital lease obligations 
we fund our cash requirements through the following methods sales of cubicin  payments from our strategic collaborators including license fees  royalties and milestone payments  sponsored research funding and research grants  equity and debt financings  and interest earned on invested capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in and to net cash used in operating activities of million in net cash provided by operating activities in includes our net income for the year of million increased by non cash charges of million that primarily consists of million of acquired ipr d  million of stock based compensation expenses  million of depreciation and amortization expense  million of amortization of debt issuance costs and million in expense associated with our k company match that is made in the form of common stock shares 
uses of cash consisted of an increase of million in accounts receivable due to increased sales of cubicin  and an increase of million net of non cash amortization expense related to manufacturing assets from our previous api supplier dsm capua  spa  or dsm in inventory primarily due to increased purchases from our manufacturing vendors as we build a sufficient supply of cubicin to meet projected sales requirements 
these uses of cash were offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due primarily to increased royalties paid to eli lilly related to increased sales of cubicin and a million increase in deferred revenue  primarily due to the receipt of a million upfront payment from merck 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  compared to million used in investing activities in and million provided by investing activities in cash provided by investing activities in represents cash inflows from the maturity of securities  offset by purchases of securities  as well as cash outflows for purchases of property and equipment and for the acquisition of illumigen  net of cash acquired 
purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december   were million compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
property and equipment additions in consisted primarily of expenses related to building out additional lease space at and hayden avenue  lab equipment and computer software 
property and equipment additions in consisted primarily of lab equipment  expenditures related to building out additional leased space at hayden avenue  as well as various it upgrades 
property and equipment additions in consisted primarily of computer hardware and software and lab equipment 
net cash used in investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will increase to approximately million  primarily driven by the construction of approximately  square feet of laboratory space at our main building in hayden avenue  as well expenses related to building out additional leased space at and hayden avenue 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities in the year ended december   as compared to million and million provided by financing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
proceeds from financing activities in consisted primarily of million from employees exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities have failed repeatedly since august these auction rate notes consist of private placement  credit default swap structured securities which reference synthetic portfolios of corporate bonds 
these securities have long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a monthly auction 
these monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities 
consistent with our investment policy guidelines  the auction rate securities held by us all had aaa credit ratings at the time of purchase 
as a result of the auction failures  we have recorded temporary unrealized losses of million in other comprehensive income as a reduction in shareholders equity 
all of the auction rate securities that failed are still aaa rated and none are backed by sub prime mortgages 
the failure resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting at the default coupon rate per the terms of the certificate 
historically  given the liquidity created by the auctions  auction rate securities were presented as current assets under marketable securities on our balance sheet 
given the failed auctions  while we now earn a premium interest rate on the investments  the investments are not liquid 
in the event that we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or until they reach their underlying maturity 
accordingly  the entire amount of these auction rate securities  net of unrealized losses of million  has been classified from current to non current assets on our balance sheet 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in and the bids on the auction rate notes we hold have since declined but there have been no sales at these lower bids 
if a certain concentration  as defined in the auction rate documents  of the underlying reference portfolios default  or if the issuing bank fails to make the required interest payments or the final principal payment upon the ultimate maturity of the notes  or if the credit ratings on the underlying reference portfolios deteriorate significantly  the company may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an other than temporary impairment charge 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
in june  we completed the public offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes less financing costs of million 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment upon certain events  which equates to approximately per share 
interest is payable on each june and december  beginning december  in january  we repurchased million of the original principal amount of the notes see note s in march  we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase from eli lilly a reduction in the royalty rate payable to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin 
in exchange for this reduction  we issued to eli lilly million in cubist common stock with associated registration rights 
a total of  shares were issued at a price of in march our global royalty rate obligation payable to eli lilly on cubicin sales was reduced by two percentage points upon registration of the common stock on april  in july  we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with eli lilly and issued to eli lilly  shares of common stock valued at million  in consideration for a reduction in the royalty rate payable to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin 
in october  we completed the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes less financing costs of million 
the notes were convertible at any time prior to maturity into common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
interest was payable on each november and may  beginning may  cubist paid million in interest on these notes during and we used a portion of the proceeds from the june million convertible subordinated notes offering to repay the principal and outstanding interest of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  plus a prepayment penalty 
this repayment resulted in charges of million related to the prepayment penalty and the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the debt 
from time to time  our board of directors may consider authorizing cubist to repurchase shares of our common stock or our outstanding convertible subordinated notes in privately negotiated transactions  or publicly announced programs 
if and when our board of directors should determine to authorize any such action  it would be on terms and under market conditions the board determines are in the best interest of our company 
any such repurchases could deplete some of our cash resources 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities  such as royalties on future sales above the contractual minimums or known accrued royalty balance  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

in january  we repurchased million of the original principal amount of the notes see note s our operating leases consist of approximately  square feet of office and data center space at and hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in april   square feet of commercial space at emily street in cambridge  massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in september and  square feet of commercial space at sidney street in cambridge massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in december we have subleased the space located at emily street for a term that coincides with the september lease expiration 
we have subleased the space located at sidney street through october the inventory purchase obligations listed above represent minimum volumes that we are required to purchase from our contract manufacturers 
the capital purchase obligations listed above represent capital purchase commitments related to building out additional leased space at and hayden avenue 
the royalty payments listed above represent amounts owed to eli lilly on sales of cubicin product 
the other purchase obligations listed above represent payments related to the development of ib critical accounting policies and estimates cubist prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  accrued clinical research costs  investments  long lived assets  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
i 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  as amended by sab  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin and license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaborative agreements with other biopharmaceutical companies and distribution agreements 
we have followed the following principles in recognizing revenue product revenues  net we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees and rebates in the same period the related sales are recorded 
since the launch of cubicin in november  we generally have not allowed wholesalers to stock cubicin 
instead  we instituted a drop ship program that we have continued to maintain 
under our drop ship program  orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and acute care settings 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and acute care settings purchases of our product  and also prevents unusual purchasing patterns since it closely tracks end user demand 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date 
our estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including industry data of product return rates  historical experience of actual returns  analysis of level inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if the history of our product returns changes  the reserve will be adjusted appropriately 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking and activity and provisions for returns which will be based on estimated product in the distribution channel that may not sell through to end users 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves quarterly 
our medicaid and chargeback reserves have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for known end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid rebates based on an analysis of customer sales mix data to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of rebate can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
reserves for medicaid rebate programs are included in accrued liabilities and were  and  at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks  wholesaler management fees and customer rebates are offset against accounts receivable and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the year ended december   and  provisions for sales returns  chargebacks  rebates  wholesaler management fees and prompt pay discounts that were offset against product revenues totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model that we currently operate under  and the low level of actual product returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims experienced to date  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
multiple element arrangements we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
our assessment of our obligations and related performance periods require significant management judgement 
license revenues non refundable license fees are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue once received and are generally recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligation only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
if an agreement contains product development services  the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized and as a result  management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of product development quarterly 
milestones revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
contingent payments under license agreements that do not involve substantial effort on the part of the company are not considered substantive milestones 
such payments are recognized as revenue when the contingency is met only if there are no remaining performance obligations or any remaining performance obligations are priced at fair value 
otherwise  the contingent payment is recognized as the company completes its performance obligations under the arrangement 
research services revenues from sbir grants to conduct research and development are recognized as the eligible costs are incurred up to the granted funding limit

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  basis 
included in the cost of inventories are employee stock based compensation costs capitalized under sfas r 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements  or inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off to cost of product revenues 
charges for inventory write downs are not reversed if it is later determined that the product is saleable  therefore  any such inventory would be sold at zero cost 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
iii 
accrued clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as contract research organizations  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
contracts and studies vary significantly in length  and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs that have a dollar limit cap  and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies to the extent possible through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope  and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
clinical trial expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of the study  the required level of patient enrollment  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those with a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements and that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
iv 
investments it is our intent to hold all investments to their effective maturity in accordance with our investment policy 
however  if the circumstances regarding an investment were to change  such as a change in an investment s external credit rating  we would consider a sale of the related security to minimize any losses 
the appropriateness of all investment classifications is reviewed at each reporting date 
the amount of the unrealized loss on the auction rate notes is determined through a valuation analysis which includes an assessment of the risk related to the underlying corporate bond portfolio as well as the actual sales activity of these auction rate notes at current available market bids 
included in our investments are auction rate notes  which consist of private placement  credit default swap structured securities which reference synthetic portfolios of corporate bonds 
these securities have long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a monthly auction 
while the underlying securities of auction rate securities may have contractual maturities of more than ten years  the interest rates on such securities reset at intervals of  or days 
historically  auction rate securities have been priced and traded as short term investments because of this reset feature and have been considered short term available for sale investments 
given the repeated failure of auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities  we do not consider these investments to be liquid and classified them as long term investments as of december  as a result of the auction failures  we have recorded temporary unrealized losses of million in other comprehensive income as a reduction in shareholders equity 
the amount of the unrealized loss on the auction rate notes is determined through a valuation analysis which is based on bids from the broker who is the market maker for these instruments  corroborated through an analysis of the underlying instruments 
we consider this loss to be temporary in nature 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in and the bids on the auction rate notes we hold have since declined 
if a certain concentration  as defined in the auction rate documents  of the underlying reference portfolios default  or if the issuing bank fails to make the required interest payments or the final principal payment upon the ultimate maturity of the notes  or if the credit ratings on the underlying reference portfolios deteriorate significantly  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an other than temporary impairment charge 
investment classification detail can be found in note e  investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
v 
long lived assets in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate plant and equipment using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic life  which ranges from years to years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of our corporate headquarters building 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgment and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain long lived assets are impaired 
vi 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards  and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we determine that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through december   we believe it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets 
we continue to monitor the available information in determining whether there is sufficient positive evidence to consider releasing the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets 
should we determine the valuation allowance is no longer required  a tax benefit would be recorded in the financial period of the change in determination 
vi 
stock based compensation effective january   our accounting policy related to stock option accounting changed upon our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of share based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeiture rates 
in order to determine the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the immediate future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
estimating forfeitures also requires significant judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on both current and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based on the exercise behavior and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of share based pre vesting cancellations 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
during the years ended december  and we incurred million and million of compensation cost under sfas r  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued a fasb staff position  or fsp  to defer the effective date of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the fsp 
the delay is intended to provide the board additional time to consider the effect of certain implementation issues that have arisen from the application of sfas to these assets and liabilities 
sfas was issued on september   and as issued  was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application was encouraged 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  and the goodwill acquired in the business combination 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will be applied prospectively 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas r will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests nci and classified as a component of equity 
the statement also requires that entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf concludes that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
this consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the initial adjustment to reflect the effect of applying the consensus as a change in accounting principle would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation requires that the company determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
see note p  income taxes  for additional information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes  auction rate securities  and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we currently own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve capital until it is required to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
included in our investments are auction rate notes  which consist of private placement  credit default swap structured securities which reference synthetic portfolios of corporate bonds 
these securities have long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a monthly auction 
these auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities 
in august  auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed and have failed repeatedly since then 
as a result of the auction failures  we have recorded unrealized losses of million in other comprehensive income as a reduction in shareholders equity 
all of the auction rate securities that failed are still aaa rated and none are backed by sub prime mortgages 
the failure resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting at the default coupon rate per the terms of the certificate 
given the failed auctions  while we now earn a premium interest rate on the investments  the investments are not liquid 
in the event that we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in and the bids on the auction rate notes the company holds have since declined 
if a certain concentration  as defined in the auction rate documents  of the underlying reference portfolios default  or if the issuing bank fails to make the required interest payments or the final principal payment upon the ultimate maturity of the notes  or if the credit ratings on the underlying reference portfolios deteriorate significantly  the company may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an other than temporary impairment charge 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december   the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes due in amounted to million 
the estimated fair value of long term debt was determined using quoted market rates 
the interest rates on the convertible subordinated notes and capital lease obligation are fixed and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk
