item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the company s business consists of three manufacturing facilities 
these facilities primarily manufacture apis  ingredients derived from organic chemistry and pharmaceutical intermediates 
as part of the process of evaluating strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  the sale of two businesses within the former human health segment was completed in october and the sale of the businesses that comprised the bioproducts and biopharma segments was completed in february  and accordingly  these businesses are being reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
the following significant events occurred during which affected results from continuing operations a charge of  recorded within operating expenses for strategic alternatives costs 
a charge of  recorded within operating expenses for restructuring expenses 
a charge of recorded within interest expense for the write off of unamortized debt costs 
sales in increased to  including a favorable impact resulting from foreign currency  from  in increased sales of products based on proprietary technology  and higher demand for generic apis primarily contributed to the sales increase 
the company continued its expansion of its custom development pipeline during and successfully transitioned seven products from phase iii clinical trials to commercial production during the year 
with one of the broadest portfolios of products and services in the api market  the company remains profitable and represents a solid platform for future growth 
gross margins in increased to from in on a performance basis excluding foreign currency impact  gross margins were in the marginal increase is due primarily to favorable product mix mostly offset by lower pricing 
a pharmaceutical company  with which a long term sales contract is in effect  accounted for of gross sales 
the company negotiated an extension of this contract to which resulted in lower profitability for sales under this arrangement in the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in tax expense in includes  of benefit related to the recognition of certain tax attributes as a result of the sale of the businesses that comprised the bioproducts and biopharma segments 
the tax provisions in and are primarily affected by the non recognition of tax benefits in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions where losses are incurred and the company records valuation allowances against the benefits  the recording of tax expense for profitable non us entities and agreed income tax audit adjustments in the us and non us entities 
the company reported a loss from continuing operations of  or per diluted share in  compared to  or per diluted share  in critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the dollars in thousands  except share data likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
the company has certain contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
these deliverables often include process development services and commercial production and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
for contracts that contain milestone based payments  the company recognizes revenue using the proportional performance method based on the percentage of costs incurred relative to the total costs estimated to be incurred to complete the contract 
revenue recognition computed under this methodology is compared to the amount of non refundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date and the lesser of the two amounts is recognized as revenue at each reporting date 
the proportional performance methodology applied by the company for revenue recognition  utilizes an input based measure  specifically labor costs  because the company believes the use of an input measure is a better surrogate of proportional performance than an output based measure  such as milestones 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
since payments received are typically non refundable  the termination of a contract by a customer prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received not previously recognized as revenue 
sales terms to certain customers include remittance of discounts if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs which are classified as allowances and rebates 
the company bills a portion of freight cost incurred on shipments to customers 
freight costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
amounts billed to customers are recorded within net revenues 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments the review of long lived assets  principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles  requires the company to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  the long lived assets are written down to fair value 
the review of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is done annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable utilizing a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model and compared to the carrying value 
if such analysis indicates that impairment may exist  the company then estimates the fair value of the other assets and liabilities utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses to calculate an impairment charge 
the determination of fair value is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows primarily based on operating plans  discount rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
dollars in thousands  except share data environmental and litigation contingencies the company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
see note for a discussion of the company s current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and our position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that the company will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
if probable and estimable  the company accrues for the costs of clean up  settlements and legal fees 
if the aggregate amount of the liability and the timing of the payment is fixed or reasonably determinable  the company discounts the amount to reflect the time value of money 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the company may have made with respect to their resolution 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits in the us  where profitability is uncertain and net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income or where future profitability is uncertain 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable 
the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is selected by projecting cash flows associated with plan obligations which were matched to a yield curve of high quality bonds 
the company then selected the single rate that produces the same present value as if each cash flow were discounted by the corresponding spot rate on the yield curve
