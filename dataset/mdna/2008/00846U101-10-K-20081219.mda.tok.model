overview and executive summary agilent technologies  inc we  agilent or the company is the world s premier measurement company  providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
as of october   agilent has two primary businesses focused on the electronic measurement market and the bio analytical measurement market 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
in december  we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business 
in  we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business  verigy ltd 
verigy 
the results of our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
agilent s net revenue from continuing operations in was  million  an increase of percent in comparison to foreign currency movements accounted for percentage points of revenue growth compared to a further one percentage point of revenue growth in was attributable to acquisitions 
our bio analytical measurement business performed well throughout the year and net revenue in increased by percent in comparison to foreign currency movements and acquisitions accounted for and percentage points  respectively  of bio analytical measurement business revenue growth compared to demand for our bio analytical measurement products and services increased across all markets in which our life science and chemical analysis businesses operate 
in our electronic measurement business  net revenue in increased percent in comparison to adjusted for foreign currency movements  electronic measurement revenue declined one percent in compared to our electronic measurement business saw reasonable growth in the communications test market  but a slight decline in the general purpose test market compared to growth for the electronic measurement segment was led by broadband and wireless manufacturing test markets and wireless r d 
the decline in general purpose test was attributable to weakness in computer and semiconductor market 
agilent s total net revenue in increased percent in comparison to net income was million in and million in net income in was  million  which included the income from and gain on sale of our semiconductor products business for  million  the income from the discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business for million and a gain of million on the sale of our investment in lumileds 
in  and we generated operating cash flows from continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively 
as of october   and we had cash and cash equivalents balances  million   million and  million  respectively 
the recent capital and credit market crisis is adversely affecting the us and global economies 
this can have adverse effects on agilent s markets 
slower economic growth could lead to lower demand for agilent s products and services 
looking forward  we face challenging business conditions as the global economic environment deteriorates and the outlook is uncertain 
our primary strategy is to pursue profitable markets with our leading edge measurement solutions 
our operating model enables us to allocate resources to opportunities and to increase the variability of our cost structure 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  investment impairments  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
investment impairments 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our equity and debt securities and our cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
share based compensation 
we account for share based awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  shared based payment sfas no 
r which was effective november  for agilent 
under the standard  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis for awards granted after november  over the vesting period of the award 
for awards issued prior to november   we recognize share based compensation expense based on fasb interpretation accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which provides for accelerated expensing 
our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
we consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted  including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the stock price volatility using the implied volatility of agilent s publicly traded stock options 
we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility 
in reaching this conclusion  we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are traded and our ability to find traded options with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing 
a percent increase in our estimated volatility from percent to percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately percent if no other factors were changed 
in the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from years to years 
in revising this estimate  we considered several factors  including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees 
in the first quarter of  we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees  on average  exercise their options at years 
in  we granted restricted stock units rather than stock options to the majority of our employee base that received equity compensation 
see note  share based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover  retiree mortality rates  and portfolio composition 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date october for us plans and september for non u 
s plans 
the us discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve 
the discount rate increased significantly over the prior year from percent to percent due to higher bond yields 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or increased 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns 
plan assets are valued at fair market value 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on plan assets for would result in a million impact on us pension expense and a million impact on non us pension expense 
the net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations excluding curtailments and settlements were million in  million in  and million in valuation of long lived assets 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
we have also assessed the recoverability of our long lived assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell 
during  we incurred million of asset impairment charges 
in addition  we recorded million of investment impairment charges during the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses  which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions 
we then determine the carrying value of these businesses 
we exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses 
we then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets such as our property  plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accounting for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we consider evidence such as our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
at october   we provided partial valuation allowances for our us deferred tax assets and full or partial valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of a valuation allowance in a given taxing jurisdiction 
we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although fasb interpretation no 
 which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  the new threshold and measurement attributes prescribed by the pronouncement will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge revenues  expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short term basis rolling twelve month period 
therefore  we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term 
results from continuing operations orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders net revenue products services and other total net revenue years ended october  over ppts change over ppts change of total net revenue products services and other total net revenue in was  million  a percent increase over the  million net revenue recorded in foreign currency movements accounted for percentage points of revenue growth compared to a further one percentage point of revenue growth in was attributable to bio analytical acquisitions 
net revenue in was  million  a percent increase over the  million net revenue recorded in the bio analytical measurement segment achieved revenue growth for the year of percent with increases in both life science and chemical analysis businesses 
foreign currency movements and acquisitions accounted for and percentage points  respectively  of bio analytical measurement revenue growth compared to in life science  revenue from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets increased but capital spending within those markets is under pressure leading to a slow down in demand 
revenue from academic and government markets increased and was assisted in large part by the contributions made by stratagene and velocity in chemical analysis we saw strong growth in petrochemical and food safety markets and more modest growth in environmental testing 
the petrochemical market continued to grow with replacement demand and plant expansion 
the food safety market continued to be strong as the food industry is under continued pressure to ensure safety 
in  our bio analytical business performed very well throughout the year and net revenue in increased by percent in comparison to demand for our products and services increased across every market in which our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses operated 
our electronic measurement business saw a percent revenue growth overall with an increase in communications test market and a slight decline in the general purpose test market 
adjusted for foreign currency movements  electronic measurement revenue declined one percent in compared to the communications test business increased revenues in the broadband and wireless manufacturing test markets and wireless r d 
in the general purpose test business the aerospace defense market increased in the first six months of  but has been flat in the second six months of this year due to delays in spending and budgetary pressures 
the computer and semiconductor markets decreased and remain under considerable pressure with consumer electronics spending down and manufacturers delaying capital investments 
in  our electronic measurement net revenue increased percent in comparison to growth for the electronic measurement segment was led by aerospace defense and wireline wireless research and development 
there was a reduction in revenues in the wireless manufacturing market during the year as the industry experienced excess capacity in handset test 
services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products  warranty extensions and consulting 
services and other revenue increased percent as compared to backlog on october   our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at october  on october   our unfilled orders for the bio analytical measurement business were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at october  we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to customers within nine months 
on average  our unfilled orders represent approximately two months worth of revenues 
in light of this experience  backlog on any particular date  while indicative of short term revenue performance  is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long term revenue performance

we experienced an unfavorable impact in gross and operating margins due to the comparative weakness of the us dollar and japanese yen denominated revenues against the euro and malaysian ringgit costs only partially offset by hedging gains 
gross inventory charges were million in  million in and million in sales of previously reserved inventory were million in  million in and million in our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
we conduct five types of research and development basic research  which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future  foundation technologies  which enables fundamental advances across all businesses  communications  which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information  life sciences  which enables next generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes  and measurement  which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems 
our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices  digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies  software  systems and solutions such as applied mathematics  knowledge management and measurement science  life sciences such as computational biology  molecular diagnostics and high throughput measurements  and photonics  such as precision automation technology  optical switching and high speed optical links 
in each of these research fields  we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon 
some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than  products already in production  other research is on major new product releases  and yet other focused on developing new product segments for the future 
due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses  there are a number of drivers of this expense 
income from continuing operations in was million 
income from continuing operations in was million 
income from continuing operations in was  million  which includes a gain of million for the sale of our investment in lumileds  an equity investment 
at october   our headcount  on a continuing operations basis  was approximately  compared to  in and  in provision for income taxes from continuing operations years ended october  in millions provision for income taxes for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations 
the percent continuing operations tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the us federal and state valuation allowances which results in us tax expense of nearly zero 
it also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
without considering interest and penalties  the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the netherlands  puerto rico  switzerland  the us  and the us where we have recorded valuation allowances 
we intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations 
the percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes at an effective tax rate of zero in the us due to a release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions 
the low continuing operations tax rate includes a benefit of million related to valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in other comprehensive income items  portions of which are attributable to increases in currency translation adjustments and to increases in the value of certain stock investments 
in addition  the tax rate includes benefits totaling million related to the resolution of primarily non us tax issues associated with the spin off of agilent from hewlett packard 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations 
the percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes on the sale of our lumileds joint venture at an effective tax rate of zero in the us due to the operation of the valuation allowance and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions 
in addition  the low continuing operations tax rate is a result of the million benefit related to the resolution of issues covered by a tax sharing agreement between agilent and hewlett packard 
the tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations 
agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions  most significantly in singapore  malaysia and switzerland 
the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions 
as a result of the incentives  the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
during  we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the us and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
during  we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our us federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance 
during  we maintained a partial us federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our us state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance increased substantially as a result of changes to other comprehensive income related taxes for pensions  certain mark to market investments  currency translation adjustments and an increase in the amount of foreign tax credits 
cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence to require maintaining full valuation allowances 
during  we established a partial valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of one foreign entity 
we intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of a valuation allowance in a given taxing jurisdiction 
effective at the beginning of the first quarter of  we adopted fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate each uncertain tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we increased the liability for net unrecognized tax benefits by million  and accounted for the increase as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of million 
the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million 
we historically classified unrecognized tax benefits in current taxes payable  or as reductions to tax receivables or net deferred tax assets when appropriate 
as a result of adopting fin no 
 approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were reclassified to long term income taxes payable from current taxes payable 
most of these gross unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate  if realized 
we continue to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
as of the date of adoption of fin no 
 we had accrued million for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits 
our us federal income tax returns for through have been under audit by the internal revenue service irs 
in august  we received a revenue agent s report rar 
in the rar  the irs proposes to assess a net tax deficiency  after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits  for those years of approximately million  plus penalties of approximately million and interest 
if the irs were to fully prevail  our net operating loss and tax credits generated in recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been  and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result 
the rar addresses several issues 
one issue  however  relating to the use of agilent s brand name by our foreign affiliates  accounts for a majority of the claimed tax deficiency 
we believe that the claimed irs adjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to this claim 
therefore  we have not included any tax for this item in our tax provision for or we have filed a formal protest and will address these matters with the appeals office of the irs 
in the protest  we vigorously opposed the claim associated with agilent s brand name  and most of the other claimed adjustments proposed in the rar 
in april of  we received a rebuttal to our formal protest  and after reviewing the irs s arguments  our assessment of the risks remains the same 
the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may take several years 
based on current information  it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
for all us and other tax jurisdictions  we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would be required 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliate and gain on sale lumileds agilent sold its interest in lumileds on november  lumileds was a global joint venture between agilent and koninklijkephilips electronics nv philips 
lumileds manufactures high power light emitting diodes and solid state lighting solutions 
pursuant to the share purchase agreement  upon closure of the sale transaction  the joint venture agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated 
the purchase price paid by philips under the share purchase agreement was million 
in addition  lumileds repaid the million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest under the credit agreement  dated as of november  our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in lumileds was million in global infrastructure organization our infrastructure costs decreased by one percent in relative terms compared to the global infrastructure organization passes these costs on to our businesses according to usage of services provided 
from a headcount perspective  over the years  we have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance  it and workplace services and moved many of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions 
the global infrastructure organization ended with approximately  employees  a decrease of employees from one year ago and a decrease of employees from two years ago 
over the past two years on a region basis  our headcount has dropped by people in the americas and europe and by in asia 
segment overview agilent is a measurement company providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
as of october   agilent has two primary businesses focused on the electronic measurement market and the bio analytical measurement market 
electronic measurement our electronic measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems monitoring  management and optimization tools for communications networks and services  software design tools and related services that are used in the design  development  manufacture  installation  deployment and operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services 
related services include start up assistance  instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair 
we also offer customization  consulting and optimization services throughout the customer s product lifecycle 
orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders net revenue from products net revenue from services and other total net revenue electronic measurement orders declined percent in  down from percent growth experienced in compared to on a geographic basis  orders grew percent in europe and declined percent in the americas and percent in asia and japan  respectively 
in  orders grew percent as growth in the americas and europe was offset by declines in asia  most notably in japan 
order growth in was driven by strength in aerospace defense and general purpose markets  which was offset by declines in the wireless manufacturing and communications market 
electronic measurement revenue grew percent in compared to a percent increase in as strength in the communications test market was offset by a slight decline in general purpose test 
regionally  revenue from the americas grew percent  europe grew percent and asia grew percent from one year ago 
adjusted for foreign currency movements  electronic measurement revenue declined percentage point in compared to in  revenue grew percent with growth in general purpose markets offset by declines in communications test and regional growth in the americas and europe offset by declines in asia 
revenue growth in was driven by the ongoing global economic expansion and steady consumer electronics spending in the general purpose market 
general purpose test revenue  representing approximately percent of electronic measurement  declined percent to  million in compared to within general purpose test  growth in aerospace and defense and other general purpose test business was offset by a decline in the computer and semiconductor test market 
intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance markets were strong applications for radio frequency rf content  as well as communications and networking 
the computer and semiconductor measurement markets were down compared to last year due to a sharp decline in the parametric test market and weakness in semiconductor related capital equipment market  while our digital test business improved over last year 
overall general test markets have weakened in the second half of the year due to on going weakness in electronic manufacturing and semiconductor test markets and softening in aerospace defense and general purpose markets 
communications test revenue  representing approximately percent of electronic measurement  grew percent to  million in compared to the year over year growth was driven by strength in broadband and wireless manufacturing test markets  as well as wireless r d and electronic design automation eda 
weakness in the communications test market was isolated to the network monitoring and installation and maintenance markets 
strength in broadband r d and manufacturing test continues to be driven by the convergence of an all internet protocol based network for service delivery including video  voice  data  and mobile services 
investment in wireless manufacturing was driven largely by the growth in smart phones  while wireless r d test focused primarily on high speed applications  as well as pre conformance and interoperability test solutions 
a pause in demand for wimax test solutions in the second half of the year was offset by on going demand for next generation cellular technologies test applications 
looking forward  we expect continued weakness in our electronic measurement business 
given the current market uncertainty and volatility  these markets are expected to decline due to on going weakness in electronic manufacturing and semiconductor test markets and broader market weakness 
growth opportunities are expected to be limited to the expansion of wireless g coverage and services high data rate  multi media services supported by multi functional handsets  emerging cellular technologies  and continued opportunities in broadband access  voice over internet protocol and fiber to the home  due to consumer demand for voice data video converged services 
we believe the aerospace and defense market s trend of investment in areas of signal intelligence  communications  surveillance and information warfare bodes well for long term growth 
these growth opportunities are expected to be tempered by slowdowns in capital spending  government budget delays or reductions  continued contraction in the semiconductor test market and the current global economic uncertainty

segment reporting change in the first quarter of  we will form a new operating segment from our existing businesses  the semiconductor and board test segment 
the new segment will cover semiconductor equipment and services sold to semiconductor manufacturing and printed circuit board assembly customers 
the semiconductor and board test segment will combine laser interferometer  parametric test and printed circuit board manufacturing test equipment 
laser interferometer was formerly part of the bio analytical measurement segment and both the parametric test and printed circuit test were formerly part of the electronic measurement segment 
the semiconductor board test segment will be determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations 
operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance 
other factors  including technology and delivery channels  consumer specific solutions  highly cyclical market and specialized manufacturing  will be considered in determining the formation of this new operating segment 
in the first quarter of  we will also move microscopy measurement from the bio analytical measurement segment to the electronic measurement segment 
microscopy measurement will combine with existing units in the electronic measurement segment for increased synergy with product lines and operational resources 
all historical segment numbers will be recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements  beginning with our form q filing for the first quarter of the following table reflects the restatement of selected financial information of our operating segments for fiscal  and on the new basis bio analytical measurement electronic measurement semiconductor and board test total segments in millions year ended october  orders total net revenue income from operations year ended october  orders total net revenue income from operations year ended october  orders total net revenue income from operations financial condition liquidity and capital resources our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside of the us most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us but  under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
agilent has accrued us federal taxes on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us repatriation could result in additional us federal income tax payments in future years 
where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds  our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the us and we would meet us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
our financial position as of october  consisted of cash and cash equivalents of  million as compared to  million as of october  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million in compared to million provided in we paid approximately million in taxes in as compared to million in the same period in higher tax payments in were primarily due to one time taxes related to transfers of intellectual property between affiliated entities

under the agreement with lloyds tsb  no party will have the right to accelerate the due date or cause a redemption of the preferred shares  unless there is a specific event of default 
world trade will be obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to lloyds tsb at a rate per annum  reset quarterly  with reference to libor plus basis points beginning on november  world trade owns all of the outstanding common shares of cayco  which is an entity distinct from agilent and its other subsidiaries  with separate assets and liabilities 
on august  a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of agilent  borrowed indian rupees equivalent to million from citibank na at percent per annum interest rate for years  maturing on august  to finance a capital project in india 
the loan is classified as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet 
as of october   we had approximately billion of unrestricted cash and billion of restricted cash that could be used to repurchase or redeem the debt mentioned above 
however  most of this cash is overseas and would need to be repatriated to the us in order to be used to satisfy the repurchase obligation 
repatriation could result in additional us federal income tax payments in future years 
on may   we entered into a five year credit agreement  which provides for a million unsecured credit facility that will expire on may  as of october   we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
see note commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
on may   standard poor s rating services s p changed their outlook on agilent s bbb corporate credit rating from stable to positive 
on july  moody s investors service moody s changed their outlook on agilent s ba corporate family rating from stable to positive 
on august  fitch ratings fitch upgraded agilent s issuer default rating from bbb to bbb with stable outlook 
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october  for continuing operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments retirement plans total operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments was million  compared with million as of october  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other purchase commitments 
these relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers 
purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a day period without significant penalties 
we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  on balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to long term debt in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years world trade debt senior notes other debt total we have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts 
world trade is obligated to make interest payments  reset quarterly  at libor plus basis points 
for senior notes and the indian rupee loan the interest rates are percent and percent  respectively 
as a result of adopting fin no 
 million of taxes payable are now included in other long term liabilities as of october  we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in  percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
