executive summary we are a global provider of oilfield products  services and equipment 
we focus on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our chemicals and logistics and our drilling products segments  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our artificial lift and chemicals and logistics segments 
we were incorporated in and currently trade on the nyse 
our headquarters are in houston  texas 
we have expanded geographically so that we now have a growing presence in select domestic and international market areas in oklahoma  arkansas  new mexico  the gulf coast  the rocky mountains  canada  mexico  latin america  europe and asia 
we market our products domestically and internationally in over countries 
several factors contributed to our financial performance in  including increased acceptance of our specialty chemicals by the major pumping pressure companies 
expansion of our rental tool and inspection services with the acquisition of triumph 
expansion of our drilling products segment with the acquisition of cavo 
expansion of our chemicals and logistics segment with the acquisition of sooner 
record domestic drilling activity levels  gas prices and oil prices 
over the past three years  we have grown both organically and through successful acquisitions of complementary or competing businesses 
we continue to actively seek profitable acquisition or merger candidates in our core businesses to either decrease costs of providing products or add new products and customer base to diversify our market 
we strive to mitigate cyclical risk in the oilfield service sector by balancing our operations between onshore versus offshore  drilling versus production  rental tools versus service  domestic versus international  and natural gas versus crude oil 
we operate as a diversified oilfield service company through our three business segments 
we believe that our product and service offerings and geographical presence through our three business segments provide us with diverse sources of cash flow 
each segment has its own technical expertise and a common commitment to provide its customers with competitively priced quality equipment and services 
the chemicals and logistics segment develops  manufactures and markets specialty chemicals used in oil and gas well cementing  stimulation  acidizing  drilling and production treatment 
additionally  the segment provides well cementing  bulk blending and transload services and transload facility management services 
the drilling products segment rents  inspects  manufactures and markets downhole drilling equipment for the energy  mining  water well and industrial drilling sectors 
the artificial lift segment manufactures and markets artificial lift equipment which includes the petrovalve line of rod pump components  electric submersible pumps  gas separators  valves and services to support coal bed methane production 

table of contents the customers for our products and services include the major integrated oil and natural gas companies  independent oil and natural gas companies  pressure pumping service companies and state owned national oil companies 
our ability to compete in the oilfield services market is dependent on our ability to differentiate our products and services  provide superior quality and service  and maintain a competitive cost structure 
activity levels in our three segments are driven primarily by current and expected commodity prices  drilling activity  oil and gas production levels  and customer capital spending allocated for drilling and production 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and procedures include but are not limited to the following cash and cash equivalents we consider all short term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs credit evaluations of the company s customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their available credit information 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot give any assurances that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the cyclical nature of our industry may affect our customers operating performance and cash flows  which could impact our ability to collect on these obligations 
additionally  some of our customers are located in certain international areas that are inherently subject to risks of economic  political and civil instabilities  which may impact our ability to collect these receivables 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials  finished goods and work in process 
finished goods inventories include raw materials  direct labor and production overhead 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method 
the company maintains a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventories  which is reviewed for adequacy on a periodic basis 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
the cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations  while replacements and major improvements are capitalized 
depreciation or amortization is provided at rates considered sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives buildings and leasehold improvements years machinery  equipment and rental tools years furniture and fixtures years transportation equipment years computer equipment years we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds either the fair value or the estimated discounted cash flows of the assets  whichever is more readily measurable 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate price paid by us in acquisitions over the fair market value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
intangible and other assets separable intangible and other assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will be amortized on a straight line over their useful lives ranging from to years 
financial instruments we consider the fair value of all financial instruments primarily long term debt not to be materially different from their carrying values at the end of each fiscal year based on management s estimate of our ability to borrow funds under terms and conditions similar to those of our existing debt and because the majority of our debt carries a floating rate 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not entered into derivative or other hedging financial instruments 
revenue recognition revenue for product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met i evidence of an agreement exists  ii products are shipped or services rendered to the customer and all significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and iv the collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable are recorded at that time net of any discounts 
earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of collectibility of the accounts receivable 
accounts receivable deemed ultimately uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
deposits and other funds received in advance of delivery are deferred until the transfer of ownership is complete 
our logistics division recognizes revenue of its design and construction oversight contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of completion 
this percentage is applied to the total estimated revenue at completion to calculate revenue earned to date 
contract costs include all direct labor and material costs and those indirect costs related to manufacturing and construction operations 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract bonus or penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which such revisions appear probable 
all known or anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full when such amounts become apparent 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the end of the reporting period 
revenue and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustment is included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
research and development costs expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred 

table of contents income taxes the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 
current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in tax rates and changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect at year end 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
earnings per share basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
dilutive earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive effect of stock options 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
while management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate  actual results could differ from these estimates

selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million during the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased indirect personnel costs in all divisions as we shift into the more people intensive rental and service business  expand geographically and expand our sales and corporate support staff 
general and administrative expenses were higher due to increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley initiatives  computing systems upgrades conversions  and implementation of the rtms rental tool management system 
all of these administrative upgrades are expected to result in enhanced control and efficiency during in addition  million of equity compensation expense associated with restricted stock and option grants made to employees  directors  and officers  was incurred in which was not incurred in depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of compared to million during the same period in the increase is due to higher depreciation associated with acquired assets and increased capital expenditures

interest expense was million for the year ended december  versus million in the increase was a result of the increase in our overall debt level associated with the triumph  cavo and sooner acquisitions 
we amended our credit facility in january in conjunction with the triumph acquisition and again in august for the acquisition of sooner 
our borrowing capacity on the line of credit and equipment term loan was increased to partially fund these acquisitions 
a provision for income taxes of million was recorded for the year ended december  an effective tax rate of was applied for the year ended december  versus for the same period in the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the percentage of earnings in state jurisdictions with higher state income tax rates  and increased state income tax expense resulting from the enactment of the new texas margin tax in partially offsetting these factors is the increased tax benefit associated with us manufacturing operations under the american jobs creation act of results for fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the year revenue increased in all of our business segments due to increased acceptance of our products  acquisitions completed in the third quarter of and in  rental revenue from the investment in additional equipment  improved pricing  and opening new operating locations

table of contents million of the increase in revenue  with the remaining million coming from internal revenue growth within the chemicals and logistics segment and the drilling products segment 
international revenue made up approximately of total revenue in versus in gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  compared to million  or  of revenue for the year the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenue in all of our business segments  with high margin tool rentals and specialty chemical sales contributing most significantly 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to two artificial lift acquisitions which typically have lower margins than our existing businesses 
as the company matures and with the addition of new products and services from acquisitions margins within the segments have shifted 
organically  management s focus has been placed on expanding sales of our higher margin products and services 
this has been offset by the addition of several new products that generate lower margins but complement the existing businesses and allow the company to cross sell products and services in new markets  and spread corporate costs over a larger base of operations 
selling  general and administrative costs are not directly attributable to products sold or services rendered 
selling  general and administrative costs were million in versus million in the largest increase in expenses related to corporate activities which rose to million in compared to million in the increase was driven by a million increase in tax  accounting and audit fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
in addition  we incurred million in professional fees related to due diligence efforts for a significant acquisition terminated in august the balance of the increase is primarily due to increased sales and field support costs in all three segments 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from acquisitions and capital expenditures 
approximately million was spent in to expand our chemical manufacturing facilities and million to expand our base of rental tools including the purchase of drilling mud motors 
r d costs increased from million in to million in due to the expansion of our product development department 
research and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
interest expense was million in versus million in the increase was a result of the increase in our overall debt level associated with acquisitions  coupled with higher variable interest rates 
the majority of our indebtedness carries a variable interest rate tied to the prime rate or libor 
a provision for income taxes of million was recorded in an effective tax rate of was applied in versus in  resulting in a million  or increase in the tax provision 
the significant increase in taxes is a result of an increase in our projected federal statutory rate based on estimated income levels  and an increase in our estimated state income tax liability

results for fiscal compared to fiscal artificial lift in the second quarter of we acquired tws and liftech as part of our goal to develop a significant artificial lift segment and expand our production driven revenue base 
the combined companies provide a broad spectrum of electric submersible pumps  gas separators  valves and services to support the coal bed methane producers in the powder river basin region and beyond 
we believe the artificial lift acquisitions will provide additional marketing opportunities for our patented petrovalve line of pump components  our patented gas separator  and our line of electric submersible pumps 
management continues to focus on effectively marketing the petrovalve line of pump components 
our patented guided valves are the only product which can be placed horizontally allowing a pump to be placed at the production zone in horizontally completed wells reducing the effort needed to pump the product to the surface 
the petrovalve can effectively lift highly viscous oil in heavy oil or tar sand production zones 
because of this we signed an exclusive agreement with a major equipment distributor in canada and have aligned ourselves with a major domestic pump manufacturer to build pumps with our valve 
revenue was million for the year versus million in acquisitions accounted for million of the increase 
the strategic complement of tws and liftech  which operate now as flotek pump services  increased the company s production activity driven revenue base 

table of contents gross profit increased million primarily due to the acquisitions 
the gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is due to a shift in product mix 
the product revenue associated with the two acquisitions are lower margin product sales compared to our existing petrovalve sales 
although several of our new products generate lower margins  they complement our existing businesses and allow the company to cross sell products and services in new markets  and spread corporate costs over a larger base of operations 
we believe we can improve the gross margins of the acquisitions primarily through better supply chain management and product mix 
income from operations increased from million in to million in capital resources and liquidity our on going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt  to acquire and maintain equipment  to fund our working capital requirements and to complete acquisitions
