item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the national security group  inc referred to in this document as we  our  us  the company or nsg and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
please refer to our note regarding forward looking statements on page of this report 
financial results for the year marked the second consecutive year of considerable improvement 
results for were marred by losses incurred from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita 
two primary major factors contributed to our improved results in first  our property and casualty insurance operations continued to improve as the year was  for the most part  free of significant storm activity other than some early spring tornadoes 
second  we realized a one time gain on the disposition of the majority of our interest in a owned subsidiary  the mobile attic  inc in april of through this transaction  we posted a gain on disposal of million pushing our consolidated net income to a record million easily topping results 
we also continued to restore capital and build assets lost during the and hurricane seasons 
we ended the year with shareholders equity of million which pushed us past pre hurricane levels last seen in mid invested assets increased million due to positive cash flows of million from our insurance operations 
results of operations the following analysis of the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  which begin on page of this form k 
primary reference is made to the consolidated statements of income on page and related notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we reached another milestone in premium revenue in posting a seventh consecutive year of record premium revenue  an increase of over levels 
growth in the dwelling fire and homeowners lines of business in the property and casualty subsidiaries were the primary contributors to the growth in premium revenue 
while the rate of growth is significantly below our annualized growth rate experienced since  the reduction of our growth rate has been necessitated by market conditions 
as discussed last year  the more moderate growth rate is in line with our expectations and is expected to persist over the next two years as we continue to build capital and recover from the adverse operating conditions caused by the unprecedented hurricane activity experienced in and consolidated income before taxes increased from  in to  in just as in  increased earnings in the property and casualty subsidiary were the primary contributor to the increase in earnings for life segment operations had modest income before taxes in of  compared to a net loss before taxes in of 
the improvement in life segment operations is primarily due to the settlement of longstanding litigation 
non insurance operations consist of the operations of the national security group  inc net income for the year increased to  or per share  compared with net income of  or per share for net income from continuing operations was  compared to  in  an increase of 
again  increased earnings in the property and casualty subsidiaries were the primary contributor to the increase in net income from continuing operations 
a decline in realized investment gains from  in to  in was primarily due to fewer disposals in the equity investment portfolio of the company 
the decline in realized capital gains was offset by net income from discontinued operations of  which consisted of a gain on disposal of the majority of a investment in mobile attic  inc in the second quarter of the company maintained a interest in mobile attic at year ended december  compared to year ended december  the year marked the sixth consecutive year of record premium revenue for the company 
our premium revenue for increased over levels achieved in however  premium revenue in was reduced by catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium totaling  as a result of reinstatement provisions of our catastrophe reinsurance contract triggered by hurricane katrina 
we did not incur any hurricane losses in and therefore incurred no reduction in earned premium due to charges for catastrophe reinstatement premium 
without the impact of the reduction in premium revenue for catastrophe reinstatement premium  year over year premium revenue increased by 
consolidated income before income taxes increased from  in to  in a significant improvement in our property casualty segment operations due to the lack of hurricane activity was the primary factor contributing to the improved consolidated results 
life segment operations incurred a net loss before taxes in of  significantly higher than the loss incurred in of 
upward revisions in a litigation settlement adversely impacted life operations for both years 
however  the longstanding litigation was settled in consolidated net income for was  compared to  in on a per share basis  net income was in compared to in hurricane losses reduced our net income by  or per share 
despite the lack of hurricane activity in  we still incurred losses from catastrophic events in the form of tornado and hail losses that totaled  net of tax and reduced net income by per share 
these tornado and hail losses were incurred during the january through april time period of partially offsetting hurricane losses  we realized investment gains of  resulting from the sale of investment securities 
realized investment gains in totaled  down compared to our decisions to sell securities and therefore realize investment gains on our investments is dictated by considerations of market conditions  short term liquidity needs and tax implications  among other factors  and are subject to significant fluctuation from period to period 
industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life segment  property and casualty segment  and other non insurance is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance life and accident and health insurance operations the company s life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in our life segment is the smaller of our insurance segments contributing of total insurance premium revenue for both and premium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the years ended december   and are summarized below revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense income before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit current deferred income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue in the life and accident and health segment totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of over 
continued growth in the independent agent method of distribution was the primary contributing factor with an increase in premium revenue just under 
the growth in the independent agent distribution method helped offset the moderate decrease in premium revenue of in the traditional home service method of distribution 
while the overall rate of premium revenue growth in the life segment has moderated  the quality of business has continued to improve 
the lapse rate is a measure of the percentage of business in force that is cancelled during the year due to non payment of premium or surrender for cash value by the policyholder 
in our traditional home service market  the lapse rate has often approached  however  with the shift to the independent agent method of distribution we have experienced significant improvement in our lapse rate 
the lapse rate for was a significant improvement over our lapse rate in of 
our lapse rates will generally be higher than the insurance market as a whole because our products are primarily intended for low to middle income consumers that may face other economic pressures from time to time 
with decreases in disposable income during economic downturns  often life and supplemental health insurance products are among the first items to be trimmed from household budgets 
also  lapse rates are significantly higher in the first year after an insurance policy is sold to a consumer 
we remain cautious about our ability to continue to show improvement in our lapse rate as the current economic downturn we are experiencing could adversely impact our ability to retain business 
nsic posted a net loss of  in compared to a net loss of  in increased charges associated with a litigation settlement were the primary factor contributing to the higher net loss in results for were adversely impacted by higher claims settlements with approximately  associated with a program discontinued in early and another  associated with final charges associated with the litigation settlement reached during year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue increased to  in compared to  in insurance products sold through independent agents now account for of total premium revenue  while the home service method of distribution accounts for of total premium revenue 
premium revenue through the independent agent distribution method continues to grow at a healthy pace  with revenue increasing in compared to home service premium revenue has continued its consistent rate of decline  dropping in compared to the lapse rate for was a marginal improvement over our lapse rate in of 
as was discussed last year  during we became more selective in the appointment of new agents and terminated agreements with agents that produced little new business or had very high lapse rates 
we believe these efforts are beginning to show results as our lapse rate continues to improve 
commission expense  including field servicing cost from the home service method of distribution  as a percent of premium revenue had a moderate decrease of in compared to independent agent commission expense and other costs of distribution declined percentage points in compared to life insurance commission rates for independent agents are typically front loaded 
this means that higher commissions are paid in the early years of a policy and commission rates decline as the policy ages 
because the independent agent method of distribution is a relatively new method of distribution  overall commission rates are skewed higher because the majority of in force policies are still paying the higher commission rates of the early years 
management is continuing to focus on reducing commissions through improving the rate of retention of new and existing business 
nsic incurred a net loss of  in compared to a net loss of  in litigation expenses totaling over million and  in and respectively were the primary factors contributing to the poor results 
the litigation related expenses are primarily related to a longstanding class action lawsuit that was settled in due to the nature of this litigation  it was difficult to predict the ultimate outcome over the last five years and consequently  we have experienced several upward revisions in our estimates 
property casualty operations the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in property and casualty operations constitute our largest segment composing of our total premium revenue in and premium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the years ended december   and are summarized below revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense income before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit current deferred income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty premium revenues totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of 
a primary focus in was working toward improving profitability in all dwelling property lines 
the mobile homeowners program showed significant improvement from an underwriting loss of  in to an underwriting income of  in the dwelling fire program ended with underwriting income up almost compared to the same period last year 
in addition  the ocean marine program made a significant turnaround ending with an underwriting income of  compared to a loss from underwriting of  in nsfc ended with four dwelling lines operating with an underwriting loss 
during the company focused on rate adjustments where needed as well as an in depth analysis of profitability by product which decreased the number of programs with underwriting losses from four in to two in the two programs experiencing underwriting losses were the limited homeowners program and the st 
louis taxicab program 
the limited homeowners program and taxicab program ended with underwriting losses of  and  respectively compared to  and  respectively for the same period last year 
a primary reason for the significant losses in the limited homeowners program was a high frequency of fire related losses 
the taxicab program settled several large litigation claims which negatively impacted the results for this line of business 
a primary focus in will be working toward improving results in the limited homeowners line of business as well as continued profitability in the other lines of business 
due to the unprecedented hurricane activity in and  we have experienced a significant increase in the cost of our catastrophe reinsurance over the last three years 
our catastrophe reinsurance rate increased from to in order to minimize the impact of the rate increase  we increased our reinsurance deductible by to million in and to million in we also added an additional layer of reinsurance protection during which increased our coverage from an ultimate loss payout of million to million 
reinsurance rates are not subject to review by state insurance regulators and are more market driven allowing reinsurers to react more rapidly to changing market conditions 
consequently  we incur significant lag time between the time we incur an increase in our cost of reinsurance and the time we are able to reflect these increased costs in our rates 
our rates are subject to review and approval by state regulators and consequently we often experience significant delays in our ability to adjust rates 
these delays result in lag times of at least six months and can last up to months 
also  we have experienced political climates in some states that make it difficult for us to factor in the full impact of our increased cost of claims and reinsurance especially in many coastal areas of the southeast us 
however  we made significant progress in adjusting our rates in and experienced some moderation in our catastrophe reinsurance rates for  so we expect a more favorable pricing environment in particularly in our homeowners program which has significantly underperformed 
several of the property and casualty programs showed improved results with a decline in the loss ratio 
the core line of business is the dwelling fire program which ended with a loss ratio of compared to for the same period last year 
additional noteworthy programs were the mobile homeowners and ocean marine lines of business which ended with loss ratios of and  respectively compared to and  respectively for we routinely evaluate our claims frequency and severity statistics in order to better understand the nature of our risks and aid in the loss reserve liability evaluation process 
claims frequency is a measure of the number of claims incurred during a measurement period regardless of amount 
claims severity is a measure of the average dollar amount of claims during a measurement period 
throughout  the frequency of claims declined as compared to however the severity of claims increased 
during  the company incurred  dwelling and homeowner claims compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of claims 
gross claims for totaled  which was  more than the severity of claims increased from an average claim payment of  in to  in primarily due to an increase in larger fire losses 
due to the increased cost of litigation associated with hurricane katrina claims in the states of louisiana and mississippi  we continued to incur adverse claims development associated with this storm 
at december  our total projected paid and unpaid claims associated with katrina were expected to exceed our available catastrophe reinsurance protection by approximately  the total remaining open claims total less than one tenth of of the total claims reported during hurricane katrina 
these remaining open claims less than claims are in various stages of litigation 
while we believe current reserves are adequate to cover remaining costs associated with settlement of these claims  due to the uncertainty of the litigation environment related to hurricane katrina claims we can not be certain that we will not have any additional adverse development 
property and casualty income before income taxes was  for compared to  in our combined ratio for was compared to in the combined ratio for of included catastrophe related tornado and hail storm losses totaling over  and adding to our combined ratio 
the primary reason for the reduction in the combined ratio was a decline in catastrophe related losses 
in catastrophe related tornado and hail storm losses totaled  year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty premium revenues totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of 
catastrophe reinstatement premium charges totaling  reduced premium revenue by five percentage points 
we did not experience any losses that exceeded our catastrophe reinsurance retention limit of  per event in  so no catastrophe reinstatement premium charges were incurred in without the reinstatement premium charge in  premium revenue in increased over overall premium revenue growth has moderated significantly over the past two years  compared to our compound annual growth rate experienced since we expect the trend of more moderate growth to continue in as we focus on improvement in profitability of all lines of business  institute rate increases dictated by the significant increase in our catastrophe reinsurance protection and rebuild capital levels after the adverse impact of the and hurricane seasons 
while the lack of hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and atlantic coast were the primary drivers of our improved operating performance  we still incurred significant losses in our two primary lines of business 
our dwelling and homeowners lines of business incurred million in tornado and hail storm related losses in the first half of  net of tax 
these events increased our combined ratio for the year by four percentage points 
however  these amounts were within our expectations of losses to be incurred in a more normal year and losses from catastrophe related events were down significantly compared to and the primary line of business in which we are continuing to adjust rates in order to improve profitability is our homeowners line of business 
this line of business composes of our total property and casualty premium revenue 
the line of business has not performed to our expectations with a combined ratio of in our core dwelling fire line of business produced solid results in with a combined ratio of 
the dwelling fire line of business produces of total property and casualty premium revenue and is our largest contributor to underwriting profits 
claims frequency decreased significantly in compared to in  we incurred  claims compared to over  claims in claims frequency in was higher due to   and claims from hurricanes katrina  rita and dennis 
non hurricane related claims in totaled  the increase in claims  not counting hurricanes  from to is primarily related to early season hail storm and tornado losses experienced in the first half of hail storms significantly increase frequency but usually carry a relatively low severity while tornado claims carry a lower frequency than hurricanes but usually carry a higher average severity than hurricanes 
while the overall frequency of claims declined significantly in compared to  the more severe spring storm season resulted in a higher frequency of tornado losses elevating the average severity of claims in the dwelling fire and homeowners line of business 
the average severity for was  per claim compared to  per claim in again  the increase is primarily attributable to the increased tornado related losses in the first half of compared to while this event had no material impact on our earnings  we did incur an additional assessment from the mississippi windstorm underwriting association mwua in totaling over  this assessment was in addition to assessments totaling over  paid in this assessment was for additional losses incurred by mwua from hurricane katrina in mwua is a form of residual market or pooling arrangement that provides coverage to those that are unable to find private insurers willing to insure them 
all licensed property and casualty insurers writing applicable coverage are required to participate in these pooling entities 
should the pooling entity incur losses in excess of its ability to pay  the industry participants in the respective states are assessed for the excess losses 
due to the extensive growth and development in the coastal regions of the gulf of mexico over the last decade  many of the pools in the states in which we operate  particularly alabama and mississippi  have experienced extensive growth 
fortunately  in the case of the mwua assessment we had adequate reinsurance protection in place and this assessment was covered by our catastrophe reinsurance 
we did incur an additional charge for pro rata reinstatement premium due to the assessment 
however  this charge was not material to our earnings 
while the mwua assessment was covered by our catastrophe coverage and had no impact on earnings  it is still noteworthy because it brings to light the magnitude of risk that companies incur from coastal pools 
first of all  this charge further depleted our remaining reinsurance protection available to cover claims we pay directly for hurricane katrina 
the assessment brought us to within less than  of depleting our final layer of reinsurance protection 
while we do not expect any additional material development associated with katrina  should we exceed our final layer of coverage  we would incur additional charges to earnings for the losses in excess of our catastrophe reinsurance protection 
also  this assessment exposes the magnitude to which many of the coastal pools maintain inadequate catastrophe reinsurance protection 
while some states in which we operate are pursuing changes in the structure of their coastal underwriting pools and seeking additional reinsurance protection  our risk in these pools remains difficult to quantify 
we continue to actively pursue options to better manage this risk  however  as discussed earlier in our risk factors section of this report  organizational structure and equitability of state underwriting pools remain a primary concern and focus for us going forward 
property and casualty income before income taxes was  for compared to  in our combined ratio for was compared to in the combined ratio for of included catastrophe related tornado and hail storm losses totaling over  which added to our combined ratio 
without the impact of hurricanes in  our combined ratio was 
as discussed previously and as indicated by evaluation of our combined ratio  the significant decline in catastrophe losses was the primary driver of the improved results 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premium revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
the combined ratio for improved slightly at compared to in no hurricane activity was experienced in along with reduced tornado and hail storm losses led to the reduction in the combined ratio 
the combined ratio for compared to improved percentage points 
no hurricane activity during led to the reduction in the combined ratio 
non insurance operations revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense income before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit current deferred income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income the non insurance operations of the company consist of our parent company  the national security group  inc the national security group has no material sources of revenue and relies almost entirely on dividends from the insurance operations to pay expenses 
these dividends are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financials included herein 
the expenses of the group consist of expenses associated with the public listing of our stock  taxes and fees  and directors fees 
the most significant expense of the group is interest expense associated with  in debt 
this debt is composed of two trust preferred securities offerings  the first being  issued in the december and the second being  issued in june the primary use for these proceeds was to add capital to the property and casualty subsidiaries to allow flexibility in continuing to increase new business production at a moderate rate 
total interest expense for the group associated with these borrowings in was  compared to  in discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of the operations of mobile attic inc on april   the national security group  inc entered into an agreement with a private investment group to sell ninety percent of its fifty percent equity interest in mobile attic  inc total cash proceeds from the sale were  and the net gain on the disposal totaled  under the terms of the agreement  nsg transferred assets of approximately  consisting primarily of portable storage leasing equipment 
nsg was also released from debt obligations totaling  consisting primarily of short term debt used to finance portable storage leasing equipment 
for  total net income from discontinued operations totaled  compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of  in the gain on disposal of mobile attic was the primary difference contributing to net income from discontinued operations in for  mobile attic posted a net loss from discontinued operations of  compared to net income of  in a decline in leasing revenues due to a decline in rental rates of a major customer was the primary factor contributing to the decline in profitability from to asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of standard and poor s investment portfolio s p or equivalent ratings of total bond portfolio aaa aa aa a a a bbb bbb bbb bb bb bb b b b the company classifies fixed maturity securities in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement and has classified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held to maturity 
the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million and million at december  and respectively 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than were expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo s and typically avoids investment in cmo s priced at significant premiums above par value 
at december  less than of total investments in the fixed income portfolio was classified as below investment grade 
due to the high concentration of government and agency securities  we have experienced no material write downs during in values of investments in the fixed income portfolio 
the results with respect to the foregoing investments are as follows year ended december net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized gains on investments before taxes changes in net unrealized gains on investments before income taxes as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows maturity schedule amounts in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years it should be noted that the above table is maturities based on stated maturity 
due to call and prepayment features inherent in some debt securities  actual repayment will differ from stated maturities 
the company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration  and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investments  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicates that operating activities provided used cash of   and  in   and  respectively 
the considerable decrease in cash flow from operating activities in is primarily due to reduction in amounts recovered under reinsurance contracts by the property and casualty subsidiaries 
the significant increase in cash flow from operating activities in was primarily due to the improvement in underwriting results in the property and casualty subsidiaries and significant recoveries from reinsurers associated with prior year hurricanes 
the negative cash flow from operations in was due to the significant increase in hurricane losses 
the consolidated statement of cash flows also reflects a decrease increase in cash from financing activities of   and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect proceeds from a trust preferred securities offering of  repayment of debt of  and shareholder dividends of  the decrease in cash flow from financing activities in reflects the reduction of debt held by mobile attic of  and the payment of shareholder dividends of  cash flow from financing activities in reflects proceeds from a trust preferred securities offering of  repayment of mobile attic debt of  and payment of shareholder dividends of  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations property and casualty claim reserves short term debt obligations consist of a  revolving line of credit 
the line of credit is due in april and management anticipates repaying the line of credit at maturity 
included in long term debt held by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in also included in long term debt is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed june  the proceeds from the debentures were used to fund general corporate expenses thereby reducing the amount of dividends to the group paid by the p c subsidiary national security fire casualty thereby continuing to restore capital in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty to pre hurricane levels 
the second issue matures june  and may be redeemed following the fifth anniversary of issuance 
for further discussion of the subordinated debentures please review note to the consolidated financial statements and form ks filed june  and december   which is incorporated herein by reference 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management feels that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company s claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation  which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s insurance subsidiary assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities  which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no current short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations and industry standards 
the company s financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management s opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance receivables deferred policy acquisition costs deferred taxes valuation of investments reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense recognition of revenue evaluation of litigation reinsurance as part of our risk management strategy  we routinely cede risks associated with insurance policies we underwrite to reinsurers pursuant to contractual agreements 
reinsurance provides protection for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophes  to alleviate fluctuation in the results of our underwriting activities and to limit our net liability for individual risks 
the estimated reinsurance recoverable on paid losses  including an estimate for losses incurred but not reported  and amounts paid to reinsurers applicable to unexpired terms of policies in force are reported as assets 
a reinsurance arrangement does not discharge the issuing company from primary liability to the insured  and the issuing company is required to discharge its liability to the insured even if the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements 
reinsurance  however  does make the reinsurer liable to the issuing company to the extent of any reinsurance in force at the time of the loss 
reinsurance arrangements also decrease premiums retained by the issuing company since that company pays the reinsuring company a portion of total premiums based upon the amount of liability reinsured 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
the estimated recoverable is recorded as an asset on the financial statements 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability 
nsic generally reinsures all risks in excess of  with respect to any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
in addition  the property and casualty subsidiaries have catastrophe excess reinsurance  which protects it in part with respect to aggregate property losses arising out of a single catastrophe  such as a hurricane 
in  the property and casualty subsidiaries had catastrophe protection up to a million loss with a retention deductible of million 
this provided protection up to at least a year near term event as depicted in catastrophe modeling results 
the near term catastrophe modeling results reflect a predicted increase in storm activity given the current weather pattern and various factors projected to impact our weather patterns in the near term 
we believe that maintaining protection to at least a year near term event will be comparable with our past practice of maintaining catastrophe reinsurance protection up to a year event under the previous models 
based on an evaluation using actual nsfc and omega exposures and catastrophe modeling based on a year loss  that is a probable maximum loss in which we have a probability of not exceeding in any given year  the property and casualty subsidiaries would pay pre tax approximately million in losses and reinstatement and reinsurers would pay pre tax million 
no significant changes in reinsurance coverage are expected during however  we will continue to evaluate the cost of expanding the upper limits of our coverage with a goal of lowering our value at risk related to probable maximum losses as upper limit coverage becomes more cost effective

deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions and other costs related to issuing insurance policies  net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety  rather they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management s assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december   we had recorded  as an asset for dac in our financial statements 
we do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs

deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are created when there are differences between assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes  as well as tax credits  net operating losses and other carry forwards 
sfas accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this standard requires management to exercise judgment in determining whether or not the deferred tax asset is realizable 
at december   there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  please see note to our financial statements 
valuation of investments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for every investment debt and equity security included in the financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
this evaluation requires significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement 
we have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments such as collateralized debt obligations and private label mortgage backed securities 
at december   there were no other than temporary impairments

loss and loss adjustment expense property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management s expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management s reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
at december   the recorded liability for loss and loss and adjustment expense was  we believe this estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the s p  if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately million 
certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note in the consolidated financial statements presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and is incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of losing principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on capital for a sustained period of time  and low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the company has moderately increased allocations to corporate and tax free bonds 
the improved yield spreads on corporate bonds has made this segment more attractive and the risk of investing in corporate bonds versus government bonds is more appropriately priced in our opinion 
we have also increased our allocation to tax free securities to further enhance after tax returns given our improved earnings performance over the last two years
