c ebitda consists of net income minus other income  net plus income tax expense benefit and plus depreciation and amortization 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities  net of any interest expense for capital leases and notes payable 
we use ebitda as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets 
we believe ebitda presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance  because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  as it removes depreciation  amortization  interest and taxes  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview background we are an exclusively online post secondary education services company 
our wholly owned subsidiary  capella university  is a regionally accredited university that offers a variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs primarily delivered to working adults 
at december   we offered over courses and academic programs with specializations at the graduate and undergraduate levels to approximately  learners 
we were founded in  and in we established our wholly owned university subsidiary  then named the graduate school of america  to offer doctoral and master s degrees through distance learning programs in management  education  human services and interdisciplinary studies 
in  we launched our online format for delivery of our doctoral and master s degree programs over the internet 
in  our university subsidiary received accreditation from the north central association of colleges and schools later renamed the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools 
in  we began the expansion of our original portfolio of academic programs by introducing doctoral and master s degrees in psychology and a master of business administration degree 
in  to expand the reach of our brand in anticipation of moving into the bachelor s degree market  we changed our name to capella education company and the name of our university to capella university 
in  we introduced our bachelor s degree completion program in information technology  which provided instruction for the last two years of a four year bachelor s degree 
in  we introduced our bachelor s degree completion program in business administration 
in  we introduced our four year bachelor s degree programs in business administration and information technology  as well as three master s level specializations in education targeted at k teachers 
in november  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
in may  we completed a follow on offering of our common stock 
additionally  during  we introduced six new degree programs and new specializations  including our first ever specializations in public safety and nine new phd specializations 
our key financial results metrics revenues 
revenues consist principally of tuition  application and graduation fees  and commissions we earn from bookstore and publication sales 
during each of  and  tuition represented approximately of our revenues 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the number of courses per learner  iii our degree and program mix  iv the number of programs and specializations we offer  and v annual tuition adjustments 
enrollments for a particular time period are defined as the number of learners registered in a course on the last day of classes within that period 
we offer monthly start options for newly enrolled learners 
learners who start their program in the second or third month of a quarter transition to a quarterly schedule beginning in their second quarter 
enrollments are a function of the number of continuing learners at the beginning of each period and new enrollments during the period  which are offset by graduations  withdrawals and inactive learners during the period 
inactive learners for a particular period include learners who are not registered in a class and  therefore  are not generating revenues for that period  but who have not withdrawn from capella university 
we believe that our enrollments are influenced by the attractiveness of our program offerings and learning experience  the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting efforts  the quality of our instructors  the number of programs and specializations we offer  the availability of federal and other funding  the length of our educational programs  the seasonality of our enrollments and general economic conditions 

table of contents the following is a summary of our learners as of the last day of classes for the years ended december   and year ended december  doctoral master s bachelor s other total tuition and fees 
our tuition rates vary by type and length of program and by degree level  such as doctoral  master s or bachelor s 
for all master s and bachelor s programs and for selected doctoral programs  tuition is determined by the number of courses taken by each learner 
for the academic year the academic year that began in july  prices per course generally ranged from  to  the price of the course will vary based upon the number of credit hours  the degree level of the program and the discipline 
for the academic year  the majority of doctoral programs were priced at a fixed quarterly amount of  per learner  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner was registered 
the fixed quarterly tuition for doctoral learners in their comprehensive exam or dissertation was  the reduced tuition rate for doctoral learners who have paid for quarters  completed all coursework except for their comprehensive exam or dissertation and met all colloquia requirements was per quarter 
based on prices from the academic year  we estimate that tuition is in the low  range for a full four year bachelor s program  from approximately  to  for a master s program  and from approximately  to  for a doctoral program 
these amounts and ranges assume no reductions for transfer credits 
many of our learners reduce their total program costs at capella university by transferring credits earned at other institutions 
tuition increases generally ranged from to in the academic year as compared to the prior academic year 
tuition increases have not historically been  and may not in the future be  consistent across our programs and specializations due to market conditions or changes in operating costs that have an impact on price adjustments of individual programs or specializations 
we implemented a tuition increase generally ranging from to for the academic year the academic year that began in july 
the price increase resulted in prices per course generally ranging from  to  for master s  bachelor s and certificate programs 
the majority of doctoral programs were priced at a fixed quarterly amount of  per learner  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner was registered 
the fixed quarterly tuition for doctoral learners in their comprehensive exam or dissertation increased to  the reduced tuition rate for doctoral learners who have paid for quarters  completed all coursework except for their comprehensive exam or dissertation and met all colloquia requirements increased from to per quarter 
based on prices from the academic year  we estimate that tuition is in the mid  range for a full four year bachelor s program  from approximately  to  for a master s program  and from approximately  to  for a doctoral program 
these amounts and ranges assume no reductions for transfer credits 
many of our learners reduce their total program costs at capella university by transferring credits earned at other institutions 
other in the table above refers primarily to certificate seeking learners and learners in our education specialist degree program 
certificate programs generally consist of four courses  and the price of a course depends on the number of credit hours  the degree level of the program and the discipline 
for the academic year  prices per course in certificate programs generally ranged from  to  for the academic year  prices per course in certificate programs generally range from  to  the education specialist program was introduced in july and is priced at a fixed quarterly amount of  per learner  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner is registered 

table of contents a large portion of our learners rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  predominantly title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in the years ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues calculated on a cash basis were attributable to funds derived from title iv programs 
in addition to title iv funding  our learners receive financial aid from other governmental sources or finance their education through private financing institutions or with their own funds 
costs and expenses 
we categorize our costs and expenses as i instructional costs and services expenses  ii marketing and promotional expenses and iii general and administrative expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses are items of expense directly attributable to the educational services we provide our learners 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits of full time faculty  administrators and academic advisors  and costs associated with adjunct faculty 
instructional pay for adjunct faculty varies across programs and is primarily dependent on the number of learners taught 
instructional costs and services expenses also include costs of educational supplies  costs associated with academic records and other university services  and an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to providing educational services to our learners 
marketing and promotional expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment and promotion  as well as costs associated with advertising and the production of marketing materials related to new enrollments and current learners 
our marketing and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media  the efficiency of our marketing efforts  salaries and benefits for our sales personnel  and the number of advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
marketing and promotional expenses also include an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to marketing and promotional efforts 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in corporate management  finance  compliance and other corporate functions  together with an allocation of facility and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs attributable to such functions 
general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense and any charges associated with asset impairments 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  net of any interest expense for capital leases and notes payable 
factors affecting comparability we set forth below selected factors that we believe have had  or are expected to have  a significant effect on the comparability of recent or future results of operations introduction of new programs and specializations 
at december   learners seeking doctoral degrees represented approximately of our enrollment  while learners seeking master s and bachelor s degrees represented approximately and of our enrollment  respectively 
the higher concentration of learners in doctoral programs reflects our early emphasis on these programs 
in  we introduced three specializations in master s in business administration  including healthcare management  two bachelor s level specializations in accounting and information assurance and security  and two doctoral specializations in education servicing k teachers 
in  we launched six new degree programs and new specializations across our three vertical markets  including doctoral  master s  and bachelor s level programs in public safety and nine phd specializations 
at december   learners seeking doctoral  master s and bachelor s degrees represented approximately  and  respectively  of our enrollment 

table of contents we expect to introduce additional degree programs and specializations in the future 
we make investments in program and specialization development  support infrastructure and marketing and selling when introducing new programs and specializations  while associated revenues are dependent upon enrollment  which in many cases is lower during the period of new program and specialization introduction and development 
relative to our doctoral programs  our master s and bachelor s programs have lower revenue per learner and higher marketing and promotional  learner recruitment and support costs 
in the year ended december   doctoral programs accounted for a significant portion of our revenues and  after the full allocation of corporate overhead expenses  most  but not all  of our operating income 
in the fourth quarter of our masters programs began to contribute positively to our operating income  after full allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
our operating strategy is focused on maintaining this trend in future periods 
prior to the full allocation of corporate overhead expenses  doctoral programs accounted for most  but not all  of our operating income in the year ended december  during the period of new program and specialization introduction and development  the rate of growth of revenues and operating income has been  and may be  adversely affected in part due to these factors 
as our newer programs and specializations develop  we anticipate increases in enrollment  more cost effective delivery of instructional and support services and more efficient marketing and promotional processes 
stock option expense 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options 
fas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the footnote disclosure only provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and instead requires that such transactions be recognized and reflected in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  relating to fas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of fas r 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  our financial statements for the year ended december  and reflect the impact of fas r expense of million and million  respectively 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of fas r 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
fas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those stock options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
public company expense 
we became a public company and our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market with the consummation of our initial public offering in november as a result  we need to comply with new laws  regulations and requirements that we did not need to comply with as a private company  including certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  related sec regulations and the requirements of the nasdaq global market 
compliance with the requirements of being a public company required us to increase our general and administrative expenses in order to pay our employees  legal counsel and accountants to assist us in  among other things  external reporting  instituting and monitoring a more comprehensive compliance and board governance function  establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws 
in addition  being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies  stock based compensation expense and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
tuition revenue represented approximately of our revenues recognized for each of the years ended december   and course tuition revenue is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of instruction  which is generally from one and a half to three months 
colloquia tuition revenue is recognized over the length of the colloquia  which ranges from two days to two weeks 
deferred revenue in any period represents the excess of tuition and fees received as compared to tuition and fees recognized in revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our learners to make required payments 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts amount based on an analysis of the accounts receivable detail and historical write off experience 
in establishing our credit practices  we seek to strike an appropriate balance between prudent learner credit policies and learner retention 
accordingly  we periodically review and alter learner credit policies to achieve that objective by restricting or expanding the availability of credit we extend 
changes to credit practices may impact enrollments  revenues  accounts receivables  our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
if changes in credit practices result in higher receivable balances  if the financial condition of our learners deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts may be necessary  which will result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made 
as of december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  and million respectively 
during   and  we recognized bad debt expense of million  million and million  respectively 
contingencies 
we accrue for costs associated with contingencies including  but not limited to  regulatory compliance and legal matters when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
we base these accruals on management s estimate of such costs  which may vary from the ultimate cost and expenses associated with any such contingency 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options 
fas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation 
table of contents transactions using the footnote disclosure only provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and instead requires that such transactions be recognized and reflected in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  relating to fas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of fas r 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  our financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of fas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of fas r 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under fas under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statement of income because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
we recognized stock based compensation of million in  related to a modification of the terms of specific stock options 
because no market for our common stock existed prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  particularly sales of our stock to and by investors and our annual independent valuation of our common stock prepared for purposes of valuing our contributions to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
more specifically  the practices we used prior to our initial public offering to value the underlying common stock for purposes of stock option accounting relied heavily upon independent third party transactions relating to our preferred stock all of which was converted into common stock in connection with our initial public offering  to the extent such transactions were significant and occurred in the general timeframe of the stock option issuances 
we issued options in december through september  that were priced at per share of common stock 
we used a combination of other valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our common stock to the extent that there were not significant third party stock transactions that occurred in the general timeframe of the stock option issuances 
these valuation techniques generally included  as a baseline  the use of the annual valuation of our common stock that was performed by an unrelated valuation specialist as of december st of each year for purposes of valuing our esop contributions 
the results of this valuation as of december  were per share 
this annual baseline esop valuation was adjusted for subsequent changes in our interim earnings per share  changes in growth in our interim earnings per share  and changes in the market value and operating performance of our peer group of public post secondary education companies  among others 
each of these factors  the most significant of which are the growth in our earnings and the estimated offering price  has contributed to the fair value of our stock at the dates of our stock option issuances over twelve months prior to our initial public offering 
we believe the annual esop valuation and the ability to measure and reasonably value subsequent changes in value due to growth in our earnings provided a reasonable basis for valuing our common stock 

table of contents prior to january   had compensation expense been determined based on the fair value of the options at grant dates computed in accordance with fas  the pro forma amounts would be as follows in thousands except per share data year ended december  net income stock based compensation expense included in net income as reported compensation expense determined under fair value based method  net of tax pro forma net income net income per common share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma the fair value of our service based stock options was estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions year ended december  pro forma expected life in years expected volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average fair value of options granted for the years ended december  and  the expected option life was determined using the simplified method for estimating expected option life for service based stock options 
prior to the year ended december   the option life was based on the average expected option life experienced by our peer group of post secondary education companies 
as our stock had not been publicly traded prior to november  the expected volatility assumption for the years ended december  and reflects a detailed evaluation of the stock price of our peer group of public post secondary education companies for a period equal to the expected life of the options  starting from the date they went public 
prior to the year ended december  the expected volatility assumption reflects the public disclosures of our peer group of post secondary education companies 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of regular dividend payments 
the assumptions discussed above were also used to value the performance based stock options granted during the year ended december  except for the expected life  which was four years 
the expected option life for performance based stock options was determined based on the evaluation of certain qualitative factors including our historical experience and our competitors historical experience 
the weighted average fair value of performance based stock options granted was 
under fas r  the amount of compensation expense will vary depending on numerous factors  including the number and vesting period of option grants  the expected life of the grants  the publicly traded stock price of the security underlying the options  the volatility of the stock price and the estimated forfeiture rate 
of 
table of contents the million shares subject to outstanding stock options as of december   million related to service based stock options which vest ratably over a specific period  usually four years 
compensation expense relating to these options is recognized ratably over the vesting period  resulting in the recognition of million of compensation expense in approximately million of our outstanding stock options as of december  were performance based stock options granted and vested in  which resulted in the recognition of million of compensation expense in at december   total compensation expense related to nonvested service based stock options not yet recognized was million  which is expected to be recognized over months on a weighted average basis 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the years ended december  and included compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of fas and compensation expense for the stock based payment awards granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in our pro forma information required under fas for the periods prior to fiscal  the calculation of pro forma expense also reflects estimates of forfeitures which are adjusted in subsequent periods as actual forfeitures differ from the original estimates 
in determining stock based compensation expense  fas r will continue to require significant management judgment and assumptions concerning such factors as term  volatility and forfeitures 
for more information concerning our adoption of fas r and its effects on our results of operations  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting comparability stock option expense and notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
accounting for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
at both the adoption date of january  and december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this total  million net of the federal benefit on state issues  represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect its effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company is subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions 
currently  no jurisdictions are under examination 
the company continues to recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
upon adoption of fin  the company had less than  of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions 
the company recognized  in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense during the year ended december  for federal purposes  tax years remain open to examination as a result of earlier net operating losses being utilized in recent years 
the statute of limitations remains open on the earlier years for three years subsequent to the utilization of net operating losses 
for state purposes  the statute of limitations remains open in a similar manner for states that have generated net operating losses 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
in september  the statute of limitations expired on federal issues related to tax years with no material impact on the unrecognized tax benefits 
in september  the statute of limitations will expire on federal issues related to tax years with no material impact on the unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents we account for income taxes utilizing fas  which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts  using currently enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred tax liabilities 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets or other elements of the tax provision 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods

our instructional costs and services expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this improvement in was driven by improvements in our variable cost structure due to continuously working on process improvements  including more efficient course scheduling and use of faculty and improved fixed cost leverage with respect to our university administration expenses and facilities expenses 
marketing and promotional expenses 
our marketing and promotional expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to marketing and promotional expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing and advertising expenses  an increase in brand awareness spending  an increase in online advertising spending and an increase in learner recruiting personnel 
our marketing and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due to an increase in marketing and advertising expenses and an increase in brand differentiation spending 
general and administrative expenses

our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due to the factors described above offset by improved fixed cost leverage with respect to our executive  administrative and finance related expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to higher interest rates and higher average cash and marketable securities balances throughout income tax expense benefit 
we recognized tax expense for the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate from to was primarily due to a one time tax benefit related to the dividend portion of the special distribution to our employee stock ownership plan esop from the proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock  which is deductible for tax purposes  and tax planning strategies 

table of contents net income 
net income was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  because of the factors discussed above  including the effects of million from stock based compensation expense  net of tax  that was recognized in quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial and operating data each quarter during the years ended december  and the unaudited information reflects all adjustments  which include only normal and recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the information shown 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except for per share and enrollment data revenues operating income net income net income per common share basic diluted enrollment revenues operating income net income net income per common share basic diluted enrollment our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to changes in enrollment 
learner population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations and learner attrition 
while the number of enrollments has grown in each sequential quarter over these periods  the sequential quarterly increase in enrollments has been the greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year  which corresponds with a traditional fall school start 
the larger relative increases in enrollments in the fourth quarter have resulted in larger sequential increases in revenue during the fourth quarter than in other quarters 
a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses does not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues  resulting in larger relative increases in operating income in the fourth quarter relative to increases between other quarters 
in addition  we typically implement tuition increases at the beginning of an academic year  which coincides with the start of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these seasonal patterns 
in addition to our recurring seasonal patterns described above  our quarterly revenue may be impacted by the timing of our colloquia tuition revenue resulting from week long gatherings of our doctoral learners for in depth  face to face instruction 
we typically have eight colloquia per year 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future based on the timing and number of our colloquia 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity we financed our operating activities and capital expenditures during the years ended december   and primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million at december  and respectively 
in august  we entered into an unsecured million line of credit with wells fargo bank 
the line of credit has an expiration date of june  there have been no borrowings to date under this line of credit  therefore million is available 
any borrowings would bear interest at a rate of either libor plus or the bank s prime rate  at our discretion on the borrowing date 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements under title iv programs 
learners must apply for new loans and grants each academic year  which starts july loan funds are generally provided by lenders in multiple disbursements for each academic year 
the disbursements are usually received by the start of the second week of the term 
these factors  together with the timing of our learners beginning their programs  affect our operating cash flow 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
on march   we announced that our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to million of shares of common stock with no expiration date 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the million increase in net income  a million increase in related to various working capital items  and a million increase in depreciation expense 
this was offset by a million decrease in income taxes payable related primarily to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation due to an increase in stock option exercises in compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  which was consistent with cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  there was a million decrease in related to various working capital items and decrease of million related to a change in net deferred tax assets 
these factors were offset by an increase of million in net income and million of non cash stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fas r for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  investing activities our cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment and investment in marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
investment in marketable securities at december  consisted of purchases and sales of tax exempt auction rate securities and tax exempt municipal securities 
as of december   the company had million in auction rate securities scheduled to mature by january  at maturity  the funds from these auction rate securities were reinvested in variable rate demand notes 
no losses were incurred on any investments in auction rate securities during or in january 
table of contents net purchases of these securities were million million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in and was due to the investments in integrating most of our business systems with an enterprise resource planning system 
we are continuing to invest in integrating most of our business systems with an enterprise resource planning system 
in we successfully launched several learner facing modules 
each had appropriate risk mitigation strategies in place to limit the impact to the business 
we expect that once implementation is complete  this integration of our systems and processes will improve efficiencies within our instructional costs and services  marketing and promotional and general and administrative expenses 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of six to seven percent of revenue  as we end our heavy capital investment stage of our erp deployment mid we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 
we lease all of our facilities 
we expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
financing activities during were primarily related to proceeds of million from stock option exercises and the related excess tax benefits of million  and net cash proceeds from our follow on offering of common stock of million  after deducting underwriter commissions and offering expenses 
financing activities during were primarily related to net cash proceeds from our initial public offering  after deducting underwriter commissions and offering expenses  of million and net proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
net proceeds from the initial public offering were largely offset by the special distribution paid in november of million and million of payments on two notes payable  which we entered into in to finance asset purchases related to our enterprise resource planning system 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   the aggregate amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms due in each of the periods presented in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases a total contractual obligations a minimum lease commitments for our headquarters and miscellaneous office equipment 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 

table of contents regulation and oversight we perform periodic reviews of our compliance with the various applicable regulatory requirements 
we have not been notified by any of the various regulatory agencies of any significant noncompliance matters that would adversely impact its ability to participate in title iv programs  however  the oig has conducted a compliance audit of capella university 
the audit commenced on april  and we subsequently provided the oig with periodic information  responded to follow up inquiries and facilitated site visits and access to the company s records 
the oig completed its field work in january and the company received a draft audit report on august  the draft audit report is preliminary  and is subject to further review and revision by the oig 
capella university provided written comments on the draft audit report to the oig on september  at some time in the future  the oig s final report will be issued to the acting chief operating officer coo for federal student aid fsa  which is responsible for primary oversight of the title iv funding programs 
the fsa will subsequently issue final findings and requirements for capella university 
the fsa may take certain actions  including that we refund certain federal student aid funds  modify our title iv administration procedures and pay fines or penalties 
based on the draft audit report  the most significant potential financial exposure from the audit pertains to repayments to the department of education that could be required if the oig concludes that capella university did not properly calculate the amount of title iv funds required to be returned for learners that withdrew without providing an official notification of such withdrawal and without engaging in academic activity prior to such withdrawal 
if it is determined that capella university improperly withheld any portion of these funds  capella university would be required to return the improperly withheld funds 
for the three year audit period  and for the aid year  we estimate that the total amount of title iv funds not returned for learners who withdrew without providing official notification was less than million  including interest  but not including fines and penalties 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december    or there can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided that the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fas  but do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be 
table of contents measured at fair value 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
fas is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after november  we are evaluating the statement but do not expect the adoption of fas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe the risk related to cash equivalents and marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to our investment policy that requires a minimum standard poor s rating of a minus or equivalent 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and were rated a minus or higher 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents and marketable securities bearing variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values  or cash flows
