based on its cash on hand  availability under existing financing arrangements and current projections of cash flow from operations  acuity brands believes that it will be able to meet its liquidity needs over the next months 
these needs are expected to include funding its operations as currently planned  making anticipated capital investments  funding certain potential acquisitions  funding foreseen improvement initiatives  paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated  paying principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled  and making required contributions into the company s employee benefit plans  as well as potentially repurchasing shares of acuity brands outstanding common stock as authorized by the company s board of directors

during fiscal  acuity brands received million in cash from stock issuances in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock purchases and a cash dividend from zep of million as part of the spin off 
these receipts were more than offset by returns to shareholders during the period in the form of repurchases of acuity brands common stock totaling million and the payment of million in dividends 
acuity brands available cash position at august  was million  an increase of million from august  the increase in acuity brands available cash position was due primarily to the contribution from operating activities discussed below  the dividend received from zep  and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the repurchase of stock  dividends paid  and capital investments

outlook the performance of acuity brands  like most companies  is influenced by a multitude of factors including the health of the economic environment 
today  it is clear many of the major economies and financial markets throughout the world are experiencing unprecedented volatility  creating uncertainty both for consumers and businesses 
this situation is exacerbated by political uncertainties in many countries  including the united states 
the vitality of the company s business is determined by underlying economic factors such as employment levels  credit availability  consumer demand  commodity costs and government policy  particularly as it impacts capital formation and risk taking by businesses and commercial developers 
as such  the current conditions make it difficult to forecast the direction or intensity of future economic activity 
this is evidenced by some independent third party forecasting entities in late october adjusting their projections for non residential construction in north america to be down upper single digit to lower double digit percentage points in unit volume year over year due to a forecasted decrease in spending as a result of these weak economic conditions and tighter lending requirements 
while the company s backlog at august  increased to million from a comparable million at the end of the prior year  management believes the increase was influenced by orders placed in advance of a price increase that went into effect at the end of august  which could adversely affect orders during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the economic uncertainty noted above  the company is currently experiencing softness in incoming orders and expects orders to remain soft for the foreseeable future due to contracting north american and european construction activity 
in addition  during much of fiscal  the company experienced significantly rising component and commodities prices  particularly for steel and petroleum 
prices on these commodities have recently declined somewhat  though management expects a high degree of volatility in pricing for these products to continue which could pressure the company s margins 
while the company has taken and expects to continue to take actions to recover higher component  raw material and freight costs through price increases  management does not believe competitive market forces will allow the company to pass on more than these expected cost increases or to significantly retain current pricing on commodity sensitive products should those specific commodity costs sharply decline 
to meet these market challenges and to better realize the opportunities  the company is accelerating its continuous improvement efforts to streamline and enhance operations  reducing spending in certain areas and accelerating investments in others offering greater growth potential 
the company intends to record a special cash charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal related to the planned 
table of contents 
index to financial statements consolidation of certain manufacturing operations and a reduction in workforce 
as a part of the manufacturing consolidation  the company also expects to incur an additional non cash charge for the impairment of assets related to the closing of two manufacturing facilities and the downsizing of a third facility  however  the amount of such charge has not been determined at this time 
the company expects to realize benefits from these streamlining actions during fiscal year that will exceed the amount of the cash charge incurred 
upon completing the planned consolidation of the manufacturing operations  which is scheduled to be finished by the fiscal fourth quarter of  the company expects to realize annualized benefits of more than million 
these actions will directly impact approximately personnel including both manufacturing positions and salaried positions in mostly non customer interfacing areas of the business 
these planned actions will enable the company to redeploy and invest resources in other areas where the company believes it can create greater value for all stakeholders and accelerate profitable growth opportunities  including a continued focus on industry leading product innovation incorporating sustainable design  relighting  and customer connectivity 
in addition  as part of these growth initiatives management expects to introduce more new products during the coming year than in any other period in its history  many of which will incorporate led technology 
the company continues to invest and deploy resources to capitalize on growth opportunities in the renovation and relight markets offering new proprietary energy efficient products and services to customers while also providing an aesthetically superior lighting environment 
management also sees opportunities to expand market presence in key markets  such as the new york city metropolitan area where the company has historically had limited participation in this large and dynamic market 
the company expects cash flow from operations to remain strong in and intends to invest between million and million in capital expenditures during the year 
also  the company estimates the annual tax rate to approximate for looking ahead to and beyond  management believes its focus on improving productivity  accelerating investments to introduce more innovative and energy efficient products  expanding market presence in key sectors such as the renovation and relight markets  and enhancing services to customers will provide growth opportunities which will enable acuity brands to outperform the market 
additionally  management believes these actions and investments will position the company to meet or exceed its long term financial goals

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates inventories inventories include materials  direct labor  and related manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs

index to financial statements long lived and intangible assets and goodwill acuity brands reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the long lived asset below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flows from operations 
specifically  acuity brands has three unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million 
management estimates the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected  future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
accordingly  an impairment charge would be recorded at that time 
at august   the estimated fair value of the company s trade names exceeds the aggregate carrying values of those assets 
self insurance it is the policy of acuity brands to self insure  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
the company s self insured retention for each claim involving workers compensation  comprehensive general liability including product liability claims  and auto liability is limited to million per occurrence of such claims 
a provision for claims under this self insured program  based on the company s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  is revised and recorded annually 
the estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the company s independent actuary 
acuity brands is also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property million per occurrence and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting three days or more in duration 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
acuity brands is fully self insured for certain other types of liabilities  including environmental  product recall  and patent infringement 
the actuarial estimates calculated are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although acuity brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations  future expense and cash flow

index to financial statements the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans 
the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  plan designs  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities  future expense and cash flow 
share based compensation expense on september   acuity brands adopted sfas no 
r  which requires compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued 
acuity brands adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and applied it to the accounting for acuity brands stock options and restricted shares  and share units representing certain deferrals into the director deferred compensation plan or the supplemental deferred savings plan both of which are discussed further in note share based payments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the modified prospective method  share based expense recognized after adoption includes a share based expense for all awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and b share based expense for all awards granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
acuity brands recorded million  million  and million of share based expense in continuing operations for the years ended august    and  respectively 
amounts recorded for share based expense in discontinued operations were million and million for the years ended august  and  respectively 
sfas no 
r does not specify a preference for a type of valuation model to be used when measuring fair value of share based payments  and acuity brands continues to employ the black scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of such awards 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures of share based awards to be estimated at time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
therefore  expense related to share based payments recognized in fiscal  and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
acuity brands assumptions used in the black scholes model remain otherwise unaffected by the implementation of this pronouncement 
as of august  there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of august   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal was insignificant to acuity brands result of operations 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods  compensation expense recorded pursuant to sfas no 
r may differ significantly from that recorded in the current period 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options 
product warranty and recall costs the company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
excluding 
table of contents 
index to financial statements costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties  historical warranty costs have been within expectations 
however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and cash flow in future periods 
litigation acuity brands recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
the company is self insured for most environmental matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
acuity brands is exposed to market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  and consolidated statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest and foreign exchange rates as well as volatility in commodity prices 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks of acuity brands 
interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations expose the variable rate debt of acuity brands to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
the variable rate debt of acuity brands  primarily long term industrial revenue bonds  amounted to million at august  based on outstanding borrowings at year end  a increase in market interest rates at august   would have resulted in a de minimus amount of additional annual after tax interest expense 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the million publicly traded fixed rate notes  the company s primary debt 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have decreased the estimated fair value of these notes by approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for additional information regarding the company s debt 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of net sales  expense  and capital purchases of acuity brands are transacted in us dollars 
however  exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to the company s operations in canada  where a portion of products sold are sourced from the united states 
a hypothetical decline in the canadian dollar of would negatively impact operating profit by approximately million 
also  a portion of the goods sold in the united states are manufactured in mexico 
a hypothetical increase in the mexican peso would negatively impact operating profits by approximately million 
the impact of these hypothetical currency fluctuations has been calculated in isolation from any response the company would undertake to address such exchange rate changes in the company s foreign markets 
commodity prices 
acuity brands utilizes a variety of raw materials and components in its production process including petroleum based products  steel  and aluminum 
for example  the company purchases approximately  tons of steel and aluminum per year on an annual basis depending on various factors including product mix 
the company estimates that approximately of the raw materials purchased are petroleum based and that approximately million gallons of diesel fuel are consumed annually 
failure to effectively manage future increases in the costs of these items could adversely affect the ability to maintain or increase operating margins
