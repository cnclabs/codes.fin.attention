overview netscout designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and supports a family of integrated products that enable performance management and optimization of complex  high speed networks  enabling delivery of critical business applications  services  and content efficiently to customers and end users 
we manufacture and market these products in integrated hardware and software solutions that have been used by commercial enterprises  large government agencies  and telecommunication service providers worldwide 
we have a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  we began to develop  manufacture and market our first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations and through the sale of netscout securities in conjunction with our initial public offering in august on november   we completed the acquisition of network general central corporation  or network general  and embarked upon an aggressive integration program designed to merge our highly complementary products and technologies 
the transaction was valued at approximately million for purchase accounting purposes 
the acquisition was financed with a combination of million shares of our common stock  million of senior secured floating rate notes  and approximately million in cash 
included in the million is million in transaction costs 
the integration of our back office systems were completed at april  the integration of the sales forces took place in the fiscal first quarter of our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products  services and licenses and royalties sold  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include our ability to introduce and enhance existing products  marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products  continued expansion into international markets  development of strategic partnerships  competition  successful integration efforts and current economic conditions 

table of contents in fiscal year  our total revenue increased million to million compared to million in fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of network general on november  as well as organic growth from the traditional netscout business 
our cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million compared to million in fiscal year this increase is due to the acquisition of network general as well as increased sales for netscout s historical business 
gross profit of million  or of revenue  in fiscal year increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal year this decline in gross margin percentage is attributable to purchase accounting adjustments associated with the acquisition of network general that  for fiscal year  required a million writedown of acquired deferred revenue and increased cost of revenue by million and by million in amortization of capitalized software and acquired intangibles 
except for the purchase accounting adjustments  our gross margin is primarily impacted by the mix and volume of our product and service revenue 
we realize significantly higher gross margins on service revenue relative to overall product revenue 
our operating expenses  which include research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in fiscal year by million  or  to million  compared to million in fiscal year the primary contributors to this increase in overall expenses were million of integration expenses associated with the acquisition of network general  million in incremental costs related to the network general business acquired on november   approximately million in higher incentive and sales compensation expenses from netscout s historical business due to improved operating results and increased sales volume and legal defense costs associated with the litigation described in item of this annual report on form k 
net income loss for fiscal year decreased by million to a net loss of million compared to net income of million for fiscal year this decline is due to million in interest expense associated with debt incurred to finance the acquisition of network general and million of integration expenses  partially offset by the contribution of the legacy network general business and gross profit improvement in the traditional netscout business 
we are continuing to see significant benefit from operating leverage and remain focused on increasing our operating margin by growing revenue while containing expenses 
we continue to see increased interest by the market and our customers on the importance of application performance monitoring from within the network 
as networks and applications become increasingly complex  high speed  and converged  and web services and service oriented architectures become more pervasive  our products are ideally positioned for this new paradigm 
during fiscal year we released new products that will help our customers stay ahead of performance issues across large  globally distributed enterprise  service provider  and government networks 
first  we introduced the industry s first packet flow based service status dashboard in the form of ngenius k  which supersedes the intelligent early warning system for network and application performance previously available via our ngenius analytics product and adds enterprise wide service health information for increased operations visibility on a business value prioritized basis 
we also announced two new key releases within the sniffer intelligence line of advanced  service aware expert troubleshooting solutions  in the form of sniffer financial intelligence optimizations for financial trading environments and sniffer mobile intelligence optimizations for mobile communications operators 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  assumptions related to purchase accounting  valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets  capitalization of software development costs  purchased software  share based compensation  and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
the application of these policies involves significant judgments and estimates by us 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products together with licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
because we have determined that the software components of our products are essential to the functionality and value of these products  we recognize our revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position software revenue recognition 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide software support and hardware support as part of product sales in the form of a month warranty for software and a month warranty for hardware 
revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software warranty expiration  typically for month periods 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the work is performed 
multi element arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the purchase is analyzed and a portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
under the residual method  the remaining portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the delivered elements  generally hardware and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
we review the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a semi annual basis and update  when appropriate  our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
uncollected deferred revenue because of our revenue recognition policies  there are circumstances for which we are unable to recognize revenue relating to sales transactions that have been billed  but the related account receivable has not been collected 
while the receivable represents an enforceable obligation  for balance sheet presentation purposes we have not recognized the deferred revenue or the related account receivable and no amounts appear in our consolidated balance sheets for such transactions 
the aggregate amount of unrecognized accounts receivable and deferred revenue was million and thousand at march  and  respectively 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or their net realizable value 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out  or fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory carrying values are reduced to our estimate of net realizable value 
as of march  and  net realizable value adjustments included within inventory on the balance sheet totaled thousand and thousand  respectively 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our net realizable value adjustment is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
we adjust the cost basis of inventory that has been written down to reflect its net realizable value 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the net realizable value adjustment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  or sfas this method 
table of contents requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships and developed product technology  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for planned integration liabilities as well as litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by netscout professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  research and development  sales and executive management 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could result in material impacts to earnings 
the carrying value of goodwill was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of our enterprise exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as one indicator that may potentially trigger an impairment of goodwill analysis 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and an asset is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
as of march   based upon our review  we determined that there has been no goodwill impairment 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets was million and thousand as of march  and  respectively 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets is recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
our acquired intangible assets include developed product technology  customer relationships and an indefinite lived tradename resulting from the acquisition of network general on november  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
acquired intangible assets also include software and non compete agreements  resulting from the acquisition of substantially all of quantiva inc s business on april  we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis  except for the acquired tradename which has an indefinite life and thus  is not amortized 
the carrying value of the indefinite lived tradename will be evaluated for potential impairment annually 
significant judgment and estimates are made when estimating fair value and useful lives for acquired intangible assets 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  the value of these assets and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred  except for certain software development costs 
costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility as defined by statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  or 
table of contents sfas and capitalized thereafter  until the related software products are available for first customer shipment 
judgment is required in determining the point at which technological feasibility has been met 
amortization of capitalized software development costs are charged to cost of revenue on a straight line basis over two years 
we also capitalize acquired software in accordance with sfas share based compensation effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after april  and those shares granted in prior periods but not yet vested as of april   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas r s adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  compensation expense was recognized only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price  granted restricted stock units  or granted options to non employees 
based on historical experience  we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our directors during fiscal years and  and an annualized forfeiture rate of and for awards granted to our senior executives and remaining employees during fiscal years and  respectively 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change resulted in pre tax income of thousand and was recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended march  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes significant judgments and estimates are made when calculating our annual provision for income taxes 
in addition  we may record certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our tax positions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our tax rate could fluctuate significantly and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of these assets and liabilities as well as on acquired or incurred net operating loss carryforward amounts 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider past performance  future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 

table of contents as of march   deferred income tax assets were million  consisting primarily of million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  million of federal and state tax credits and million other temporary book and tax accounting differences 
significant accounting judgments and estimates are made when determining whether it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will be realized and  accordingly  do not require a valuation allowance 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  a valuation allowance may be required and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize some or all of the deferred income taxes in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets will be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
a valuation allowance has been established for certain state net operating loss carryforwards  federal foreign tax credits and state research and development tax credits related to the network general acquisition  which we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas  accounting for income taxes 
if it is later determined that we are able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance 
this would result in a reduction to goodwill 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
as used in fin  the term more likely than not means that the likelihood of an occurrence is greater than 
we adopted fin as of april  as required

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities consist of the following year ending march  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at march   we had a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by keybank national association  or keybank  which allows us to borrow up to million for working capital purposes and to obtain letters of credit subject to a sublimit

cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities increased by thousand from march  to march  while cash and cash equivalents increased by million  short and long term marketable securities decreased in total by million 
our long term marketable securities include investments in auction rate securities valued at million at march   including accrued interest 
auction rate securities are publicly issued securities with long term maturities for which interest rates reset through a dutch auction in short term intervals  in the case of our securities every days 
historically  this auction process has provided liquidity and has supported a short term classification 
table of contents of these securities on the balance sheet 
beginning in february and continuing to june  uncertainties in the credit markets resulted in failed auctions and a lack of short term liquidity for these securities 
all of our auction rate securities are aaa rated and collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal government through the federal family education loan program  or ffelp  and by monoline insurance companies 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery in the auction process or other liquidity event 
at march   we valued these securities at their fair value based on discounted cash flows and classified these securities as long term on our balance sheet with the temporary decline in value of thousand recorded to other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
we continue to monitor and evaluate these securities as there is no assurance as to when liquidity will return to this investment class

this includes the acquisition of network general for million  net of cash acquired in such transaction 
cash used in investing activities also includes capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for internal use software of thousand  million and million  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  represent costs of procurement and development of a new erp system that was implemented in august capital expenditures for fixed assets of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  represent an investment in our infrastructure as we prepare for future growth 
we anticipate that our investment in our infrastructure will continue in future quarters 
for the fiscal year ended march   net cash used in provided by investing activities also reflects the acquisition of substantially all of quantiva s business for million in cash consideration 
net cash provided by financing activities 
for the fiscal year ended march   cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt in connection with the re financing of our senior secured floating rate notes  due in  totaling million net of deferred financing costs  offset by the repayments of long term debt totaling million which represents repayment of senior secured floating rate notes and the first principal payment on the credit facility 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  cash provided by financing activities was otherwise due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options of million  million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   cash provided by financing activities also reflected the purchase of treasury stock of million  in connection with our open market stock repurchase program 
on september   netscout announced an open market stock repurchase program that enables netscout to purchase up to one million shares of its outstanding common stock  subject to market conditions and other factors 
on july   the company announced that it had expanded the existing open market repurchase program to enable the company to purchase an additional three million shares of the company s outstanding common stock  bringing the total number of shares authorized for repurchase to million shares 
through the fiscal year ended march   netscout has repurchased  shares of its common stock into treasury stock through its open market stock repurchase program 
cash to be used under this program in the future is undeterminable at this point in time 
we believe that our cash balances  marketable securities classified as available for sale and any future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt for at least the next months 
if demand for our product were to decrease substantially  our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs could be materially impacted 
additionally  a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies such as our recent acquisition of network general 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities  which consist of auction rate securities  are stated at fair value based on discounted cash flow calculations 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments  us treasury bills  auction rate securities and municipal obligations 

table of contents netscout s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of illiquidity of auction rate securities  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our term loan 
as of march   we owed million on this loan with a weighted average interest rate of 
should the weighted average interest rate increase or decrease by  the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense would be approximately thousand  respectively 
netscout s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations historically has been limited 
prior to the acquisition of network general  all of our revenue transactions were extended in us dollars 
the majority of our revenue transactions are executed in us dollars 
netscout pays for certain foreign operating expenses such as payroll  rent and office expense in the local currency  and  therefore  currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
currently  netscout does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency denominated account balances and transactions is recorded in the period incurred
