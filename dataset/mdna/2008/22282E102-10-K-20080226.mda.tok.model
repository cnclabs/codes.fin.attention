item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources recapitalization 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have investments in energy projects in various foreign countries  including the philippines  china  india and bangladesh  and to a much lesser degree  england  ireland  italy and costa rica 
we do not enter into currency transactions to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
at some projects  we have mitigated our currency risks by structuring our project contracts so that our revenues are adjusted in line with corresponding changes in currency rates 
therefore  only working capital and project debt denominated in other than a project entity s functional currency are exposed to currency risks 
as of december   we had million of project debt related to two heavy fuel oil projects in india 
for million of the debt related to project entities whose functional currency is the indian rupee  exchange rate fluctuations were recorded as translation adjustments in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining million of debt was denominated in us dollars 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a adverse change in december  quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
as of december   we also had net investments in foreign subsidiaries and projects 
see note equity method investments of the notes for further discussion 
commodity price risk and contract revenue risk we have not entered into futures  forward contracts  swaps or options to hedge purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements  inventories or other commodities 
alternatively  we attempt to mitigate the risk of energy and fuel market fluctuations by structuring contracts related to our energy projects in the manner described above in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview contract structures 
generally  we are protected against fluctuations in the waste disposal market  and thus our ability to charge acceptable fees for our services  through long term service agreements and disposal contracts at our energy from waste facilities 
at ten of our energy from waste facilities  differing amounts of waste disposal capacity are not subject to long term contracts and  therefore  we are partially exposed to the risk of market fluctuations in the waste disposal fees we may charge 
our long term service agreements begin to expire in  and energy sales contracts at owned projects generally expire at or after the date on which that project s long term agreement expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject us to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenues 
as our agreements at municipally owned projects expire  we will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to 
table of contents continue operating such projects 
as our agreements at facilities we own begin to expire  we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we expect to be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and provide acceptable revenues 
we will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
at facilities we own  the expiration of existing energy sales contracts will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the price and other terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to us 
we have similar protection against energy market fluctuations at most of our projects  which have long term contracts for the sale of energy output 
at a few of our projects  we enter into shorter term arrangements for energy sales  or have market based pricing and therefore  we have some exposure to energy market fluctuations with respect to these projects 
in addition  we sell recovered materials  principally ferrous metals  under short term arrangements from most of our energy from waste projects  and have some exposure to market fluctuations with respect to such sales 
while the ferrous metals markets fluctuate  given the amount of revenue we derive from such sales  we do not expect any such fluctuations to have a material affect on our financial results 
at some of our domestic renewable energy and international independent power projects  our operating subsidiaries purchase fuel in the open markets which exposes us to fuel price risk 
at other plants  fuel costs are contractually included in our electricity revenues  or fuel is provided by our customers 
in some of our international projects  the project entity which in some cases is not our subsidiary has entered into long term fuel purchase contracts that protect the project from changes in fuel prices  provided counterparties to such contracts perform their commitments 
risk related to the investment portfolio the objectives in managing the investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiary are to maintain necessary liquidity and maximize investment income and investment returns while minimizing overall market risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including duration of liabilities  underwriting results  overall tax position  regulatory requirements  and fluctuations in interest rates 
investment decisions are made by management  in consultation with an independent investment advisor  and approved by our insurance subsidiary s board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of securities 
the market risks related to the fixed maturity portfolio are primarily credit risk  interest rate risk  reinvestment risk and prepayment risk 
the market risk related to the equity portfolio is price risk 
fixed maturities interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in interest rate 
we view these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability matching 
we estimate the payout patterns of the liabilities  primarily loss reserves  of our insurance subsidiary to determine their duration 
duration targets are set for the fixed income portfolio after consideration of the duration of the liabilities that we believe mitigate the overall interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of our insurance and other liabilities 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  and was years 
we believe that the portfolio duration is appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all other lines of business 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would cause an approximate decrease in the fair value of the portfolio while a hypothetical basis point decrease would cause an approximate increase in fair value 
credit risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in the credit quality of such investment 
our exposure to credit risk is mitigated by our investment in high quality fixed income alternatives 
fixed maturities held by our insurance subsidiary include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  collectively mbs representing and of total fixed maturities as of december  and  respectively 
all mbs held by our insurance subsidiary were issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  which are both rated aaa by moody s investors services 
fnma and fhlmc guarantee the principal balance of their securities 
fnma guarantees timely payment of principal and interest 

table of contents one of the risks associated with mbs is the timing of principal payments on the mortgages underlying the securities 
we attempt to limit repayment risk by purchasing mbs whose cost is below or does not significantly exceed par  and by primarily purchasing structured securities with repayment protection which provides more certain cash flow to the investor such as mbs with sinking fund schedules known as planned amortization classes pac and targeted amortization classes tac 
the structures of pacs and tacs attempt to increase the certainty of the timing of prepayment and thereby minimize the prepayment and interest rate risk 
in  our insurance subsidiary recognized less than million in loss on sales of fixed maturities 
equity securities our insurance subsidiary s investments in equity securities are generally limited to fortune companies with strong balance sheets  along with a history of dividend growth and price appreciation 
as of december   equity securities represented of our insurance company s total investment portfolio
