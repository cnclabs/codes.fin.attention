overview marine exploration  inc we  us  our  the company or marine was originally incorporated in the state of delaware on june  under the name jenkon international  inc we changed our name in may to multimedia kid  inc  and again in august to syco  inc 
in april  we reorganized as a colorado corporation and changed our name to marine exploration  inc on may   in an acquisition classified as a transaction between parties under common control  we acquired all the outstanding common shares of marine exploration international  inc wherein we issued  shares of our common stock for an equal number of common shares of marine exploration international  inc  making marine exploration international  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of our company 
marine exploration international  inc was incorporated in the state of nevada on march  to engage in marine treasure hunting expeditions 
we commenced our new business of marine treasure hunting in march  but have not yet generated significant revenues 
our current operations are limited to providing funding to  and making approved capital expenditures for  our joint venture partner  hispaniola ventures  llc hispaniola 
it is hispaniola that will engage in the actual search for  diving to  and recovery of  the cargo and artifacts 
in the roles just described  and pursuant to our joint venture agreement the jv agreement  we intend to pursue recovery of two vessels we call operation mystery galleon and operation abrojos which includes  without limitation  an operation to the serranilla and bajo nuevo banks in the caribbean sea in attempts to recover treasure from a spanish galleon mystery galleon and  an operation to the south reef on the silver bank  north of the dominican republic to recover treasure from an english corsair abrojos 
marine exploration inc and hispaniola ventures llc are currently undergoing preliminary operations in preparation for launching missions operation mystery galleon and operation abrojos  which include the end stages of capital formation  equipment purchasing  research  mission planning  crew training  and marine vessel restoration 
our vision is to join with individuals and entities on the leading edge of deep ocean shipwreck exploration  archeological excavation  education  entertainment  and marketing of shipwreck cargoes and related merchandise 
results of operations comparison of results of operations for the years ended june  and during our fiscal years ended june  and we did not generate any revenues 
we have a net loss of  from inception period  to june  this compares to a net loss of  for the period of june   to june   and a net loss of  for the year ended june  we had compensatory stock issuances of  from june  to june   compared to  from inception march  to june  we have had interest payable of  for the period ended june   which brings our interest payable total to  since december  since march  we have incurred  for operating activities 
of this total  we have used  for operating activities in the year end period of june   and  for the year end period of june  because we have not generated any revenues from operations  following is our plan of operation 
plan of operation we anticipate that we will need approximately  over the next months to implement our business plan 
we intend to fund this capital need through loans from existing stockholders or other investors 
most of this funding goes directly to our jv partner  hispaniola ventures  llc 
we do not allocate any of the funds for breakdown  nor do we purchase any of the equipment used for this activity 
we simply fund the project and receive twenty five percent of the gross proceeds derived from these operations  in the event that there are any gross proceeds to distribute from the joint venture 
thus we are unable to discern how our funds will be applied by hispaniola ventures 
however  it is reasonable to presume that portions will be used by it to pay general and administrative expenses  for the purchase of equipment  to obtain licenses and permits and to charter or lease marine equipment and services 
any remaining balance of the funds will be held in reserve and used by it for business purposes 
see part i  item a  risk factors 
typically  fifty percent of the proceeds derived from the recovery must be paid to the government in whose waters the treasure is recovered 
the next twenty five percent will be received by hispaniola 
the remainder will be received by us 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  we had in cash and cash equivalents 
our current liabilities include notes payable of  to non related parties and  to related parties at june  interest payable on all notes at june  was  during our fiscal year ended june  we borrowed  under notes payable with a face amount of  the difference between the face amount of the notes and the cash received   is amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes 
total amortized interest expense under these notes in fiscal year was  leaving an unexpensed note discount at june  of  one of the notes also bears interest at per annum on  and calls for minimum bi monthly interest payments of the amount of these notes remaining outstanding at june  was  with due dates from january through may all but  of the notes are secured by all our assets 
the notes have no provision for face amount reduction upon prepayment before the due dates 
total interest expense in fiscal year under all notes payable was  with accrued interest payable at june  of  total required note principal payments in fiscal year are  at june  we had related party loans of  operations have been funded to date by loans from stockholders 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and proceeds contributed by our shareholders from our recent borrowing will satisfy our working capital requirements for fiscal year however  we anticipate we will continue to incur net losses throughout fiscal year our ability to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon the success of our ability to provide funding to our joint venture partner  hispaniola ventures  llc to enable its recovery and monetizing high value shipwrecks 
at the present time we cannot determine how long that process may take us 
if cash flow is not sufficient to meet our projected business plan requirements  we will be required to raise additional capital in fiscal year while we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past  there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so 
we anticipate that we will need approximately  over the next months to implement our business plan 
while we have nothing in writing confirming any obligation to do so  we expect to fund this capital need through loans from existing stockholders or other investors 
there are no assurances that we will receive these funds and our failure to obtain the necessary funding will jeopardize the successful implementation of our business plan 
if raised  all of this funding will go directly to our jv partner  hispaniola ventures  llc 
we do not allocate any of the funds for breakdown  nor do we purchase any of the equipment used for this activity 
we simply fund the project and receive twenty five percent of the gross proceeds derived from these operations  in the event that there are any gross proceeds to distribute from the joint venture  of which there can be no assurance 
therefore  we have no control over how these funds are spent and are unable to discern how our funds will be applied by hispaniola ventures 
however  we expect that portions will be used by it to pay general and administrative expenses  for the purchase of equipment  to obtain licenses and permits and to charter or lease marine equipment and services 
any remaining balance of the funds will be held in reserve and used by it for business purposes
