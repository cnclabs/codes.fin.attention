because the company has no operations and conducts no business on its own other than owning cape fear bank the bank and bkww statutory trust i the trust  the discussion contained in this management s discussion and analysis concerns primarily the business of the bank 
however  for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  the company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the company unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates which are based upon historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note b to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be most critical in their potential effect on its financial position or results of operations allowance for loan losses 
the most critical estimate concerns the company s allowance for loan losses 
it records provisions for loan losses based upon known problem loans and estimated deficiencies in the existing loan portfolio 
its methodology for assessing the allowance for loan losses consists of two key components  including a specific allowance for identified problem or impaired loans and a formula allowance for the remainder of the portfolio 
identified problem and impaired loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change 
the adequacy of the allowance is also reviewed by the management based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting its key lending areas and other conditions  such as new loan products  collateral values  loan concentrations  changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in portfolio credit quality  including delinquency and charge off rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay 
although management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  real estate and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
interest income recognition 
interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon interest rates applied to unpaid principal 
interest is not accrued on loans days or more past due unless the loans are cape fear bank corporation and subsidiary management s discussion and analysis adequately secured and in the process of collection 
interest is not accrued on other loans when management believes collection is doubtful 
interest on non accruing loans is recognized as payments are received when the ultimate collectibility of interest is no longer considered doubtful 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all interest previously accrued is reversed against current period interest income

net interest margin pressure and growth related non interest expenses along with the increase in total average assets in contributed to the decline in return on average assets 
net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the primary component of earnings for the company is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
for this purpose  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as by levels of noninterest bearing liabilities and capital 
net interest income for remained unchanged at million for and although average earning assets for at million increased million or  the net interest margin dropped basis points during to account for the slight decline in net interest income in the current year 
net interest income for increased to million  a million or increase from the million earned in the million was a million or increase from the million earned in the significant growth in average interest earning assets of million from million during to million during was the primary reason for the improvement in the level of net interest income 
this was leveraged with the significant growth in average interest earning assets of million from million during to million during which resulted in the improvement in the level of net interest income in that year as well 
margin compression impacted the flat net interest income for although the average yield on interest earning assets increased basis points from to  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to in in  the company benefited from the increase in the level of interest earning assets coupled with the effects of a basis point increase in the average yield on those assets from at the end of to at the end of in  the company again benefited from the increase in the level of interest earning assets coupled with the effects of an basis point increase in the average yield on those assets from at the end of to at the end of the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million or in  million or in  and million  or in  consistent with its increase in interest earning assets for those years 
the increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  coupled with the volume increase in interest bearing liabilities over the volume increase in interest earning assets  impacted the flat net interest income and decline in the net interest margin from in to in while the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from to in and basis points from to in  the impact was mitigated by the volume increase in interest earning assets

for the year ending december   net interest spread was and net interest margin was 
although it moderated in  the company s reliance on interest bearing liabilities to fund earning assets caused the decline in interest margin and spread in each of the years

provision for loan losses 
the company recorded a million  million  and million provision for loan losses in  and  respectively 
the thousand decrease in the provision for loan losses in is a reflection of the slowed growth in total loans outstanding as well as the net recoveries in charged off loans during the year despite the large increase in non performing loans 
the thousand decrease in the provision for loan losses in is a reflection of the moderated growth in total loans outstanding as well as a reduction in nonperforming loans in provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that management deems appropriate 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  management considers factors that include growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors 
total loans outstanding increased by million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing   and  respectively  of loans outstanding  and   and  respectively  of nonperforming loans 
although loan growth slowed in  the increase in the percentage of loan loss allowance to total loans outstanding in the current year is due to the increase in the level of nonperforming loans  a function of the slowed real estate market 
although loan growth moderated in  the increase in the percentage of loan loss allowance to total loans outstanding in that year is due to management s recognition of the risk associated with the company s high concentration in construction and commercial real estate lending with the beginning slow down in the real estate market 
although nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding increased significantly  up to for  approximately million or of the nonperforming loans are restructured loans that are currently paying according to the restructured terms 
nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding were and for and  respectively 
on december   the company restructured two loans totaling million for one troubled customer relationship as requested  who although not delinquent at that time  could not continue to meet existing payment obligations 
the property values were reassessed by management and written down by thousand to their fair market values 
the interest rates on the two loans were lowered from to and the payment structure was changed from cape fear bank corporation and subsidiary management s discussion and analysis amortizing to interest only payments with a maturity of december  on january   an assignment of deposit account totaling thousand was added as additional collateral on the loans for consideration of the troubled debt restructure 
thus far through march  the customer has paid according to the restructured terms 
on june   the company sold foreclosed real estate totaling thousand for thousand 
however  the company financed the loan for the buyers to purchase the property and paid fees resulting in a deferred gain on the sale of thousand 
this deferred gain will be recognized on a quarterly basis over a three year period as principal payments are collected on the loan since the monthly amount is nominal 
if the customer makes a lump sum payment to pay off the loan or refinances with another financial institution  the company will take the remainder of the gain into income at that time 
non interest income 
non interest income was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
service fees and charges  which represent a relatively stable and predictable source of non interest income  totaled thousand  thousand  and thousand for   and  respectively

non interest expenses totaled million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
as a percentage of average assets  total non interest expenses increased to for and remained the same  at  for and the slowed growth in assets during coupled with the continued branch expansion initiatives which added additional overhead with increased staff and facilities resulted in the increase to 
while we added additional overhead related to expanding our staff and facilities in  we aggressively grew our loan portfolio to accommodate the extra expense

also  the company recognized expenses of thousand  thousand and thousand in   and  respectively  related to the implementation of supplemental retirement benefits for certain officers and directors 
occupancy and equipment costs increased by thousand  thousand  and thousand in   and  respectively 
the large increase in was due to the addition of three new full service branches  one in new hanover county and two in brunswick county  during the year 
the large increase in was due to the addition of two new full service branches  one in pender county and one in brunswick county  and the leasing of space for the credit administration department

the increases included an increase of thousand in data processing and other outsourced services as a result of growth  a thousand increase in advertising costs related to the company s name change and branch openings  and a thousand non recurring charge related to changes in check processing vendor 
other increases in each of the years resulted principally from the company s growth 
the company expansion plans are virtually complete for the near term 
during  the sunset beach and southport branches will be moving from their temporary facilities to their nearby permanent facilities 
management believes that salary and occupancy expenses will stabilize in the near term as the company completes its recent branch expansion in accordance with its strategic plan 
however  data processing expense is tied closely to transaction and account volumes so these expenses will increase as the company s account base continues to grow 
although fdic insurance premiums have increased and could increase further during  increases in service fee income resulting from deposit account growth should help offset a portion of that expense 
we also expect to continue to incur additional professional fees during related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of as that law becomes fully applicable to us  and increased legal expenses related to shareholder activism 
cape fear bank corporation and subsidiary management s discussion and analysis the following table details non interest expenses for the periods indicated

the decrease in income tax expense is directly related to the company s lower pre tax income level in that year 
the company s effective tax rate was   and in   and  respectively 
the overall lower effective tax rate in each year is primarily the result of an overall greater proportion of pre tax income in those years being comprised of non taxable income earned on bank owned life insurance and municipal securities 
this is especially impacted in the year results when net interest income declined and non taxable income earned on bank owned life insurance and municipal securities increased

these funds  together with loan repayments  are used to make loans and to fund continuing operations 
in addition  the company had credit availability with the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb of approximately million at december  it also had a credit line with various financial institutions in the amount of million in the company had million and million in borrowings outstanding under fhlb advances at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the company had million in subordinated long term debt payable to the trust outstanding in each of those years 
management utilizes these borrowings to help manage its cash flow  cost of funds  interest sensitivity and gap position 
total deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
because loan demand has exceeded the rate of growth in core deposits  the company has relied heavily on cape fear bank corporation and subsidiary management s discussion and analysis time deposits as a source of funds 
certificates of deposit are the only deposit accounts that have stated maturity dates  and those deposits are generally considered to be rate sensitive 
at december  and  time deposits represented and  respectively  of total deposits 
certificates of deposit of thousand or more represented and  respectively  of total deposits at december  and the company has certificates of deposit acquired by advertising rates on the internet and some obtained through deposit brokers 
on december   those out of market deposits amounted to approximately million  or approximately of total deposits and approximately of total certificates of deposit 
on december   those out of market deposits amounted to approximately million  or approximately of total deposits and approximately of total certificates of deposit 
the company uses brokered certificates of deposit as an alternative funding source 
brokered deposits represent a source of fixed rate funds that do not need to be collateralized like federal home loan bank borrowings 
the company expects to continue to utilize the brokered deposit market in the future 
with the exception of these out of market deposits  management believes most of its other time deposits are relationship oriented and  while it will be necessary to pay competitive rates to retain those deposits at their maturities  there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention 
based upon prior experience  management anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding certificates of deposit will renew upon maturity 
management anticipates that it will rely primarily upon customer deposits  loan repayments and current earnings to provide liquidity  and will use funds thus generated to make loans and to purchase securities  primarily securities issued by the federal government and its agencies  municipals  and mortgage backed securities 
as of december   liquid assets cash and due from banks  interest earning bank deposits  federal funds sold  time deposits in other banks and investment securities available for sale were approximately million  which represented of total assets and of total deposits

management believes that the combined aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term 
the company and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements 
the selected financial information and other data table is contained in this report under the heading in item selected financial data 
all capital ratios place the company and the bank in excess of the minimum necessary to be considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
asset liability management the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the company s interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the market place 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the company s earnings from undue interest rate risk arising from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
the company maintains  and has complied with  an asset liability management policy approved by its board of directors that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing the following ratios and trend analysis liquidity  equity  volatile liability dependence  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
the company s policy is to control the exposure of its earnings to changing interest rates by generally endeavoring to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
cape fear bank corporation and subsidiary management s discussion and analysis when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  the company has generally invested such funds in securities  primarily securities issued by governmental agencies  municipals  and mortgage backed securities 
its securities portfolio contributes to profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate risk management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability techniques to actively manage the balance sheet 
the primary objectives in the overall management of the securities portfolio are safety  liquidity  yield  asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits 
in reviewing the company s needs with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  management estimates its future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing  and forecasted interest rate changes 
the analysis of an institution s interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is a standard tool for the measurement of exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that are projected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
in making the gap computations  assumptions made regarding prepayment rates and deposit decay rates have been used for interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
loan prepayment rates were provided by vining sparks ibg  lp s portfolio strategies group based on their experience in a national banking market with a normal mix of loans 
deposit decay rates were derived from the proprietary model from the office of the comptroller of the currency s risk analysis division

this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods

the structure of our loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
we do not maintain a trading account nor are we subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk

a systematic evaluation process fundamentally drives the function of determining the allowance for loan losses 
this ongoing process serves as the basis for determining  on a quarterly basis  the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings 
consideration is given to historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  economic conditions in its market area and other factors 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets increased significantly by million or in  a reflection of the economic slow down in the real estate market 
however  this increase included million of restructured loans in one relationship  secured by real estate  that are currently paying according to the restructured terms

nonperforming assets decreased by thousand or in total nonperforming assets in included real estate with a carrying value of thousand acquired through foreclosure in august although nonperforming assets decreased in  the allowance for loan losses increased 
this was a result of management s recognition of the increased risk of its concentration in construction and commercial real estate loans in a moderating real estate market

at year end  one loan  secured by real estate  for approximately thousand made up of nonperforming loans 
the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on a nonaccrual basis 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis when they become days past due or whenever it believes that collection has become doubtful 
the company s policy regarding past due loans normally requires a prompt charge off to the allowance for loan losses following timely collection efforts and a thorough review 
further efforts are then pursued through various means available 
loans carried in a non accrual status are generally collateralized  and probable losses are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
amounts received on non accrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
loans are charged off when the collection of principal and interest has become doubtful and the loans no longer can be considered sound collectible assets or  in the case of unsecured loans  when they become days past due

while management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
in addition  various regulatory agencies may require us to make adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
additional statistical information regarding the company s allowance for loan losses is contained in the tables appearing in item of this report under the caption allowance for loan losses
