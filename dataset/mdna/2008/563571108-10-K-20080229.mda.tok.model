marine segment gross profit increased in to million from million in  while gross margin increased to from over the same period 
engineering  selling and administrative es a expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by the crane and foodservice segments and corporate expenses 
crane segment es a expense increased due to higher engineering and selling expenses  increased employee related costs and expenses related to the initiation of an erp implementation project 
foodservice segment es a expenses increased due to higher employee and commission costs 
corporate expenses increased primarily due to increased employee related costs 
es a expenses of the marine segment decreased slightly  primarily as a result of lower bid costs and professional fees 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million versus million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from the company s redemption of the senior subordinated notes due this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and higher accounts receivable securitization interest costs 
we redeemed our senior subordinated notes due in august pursuant to the terms of the indenture  we paid the note holders percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date 
as a result of this redemption  we incurred a charge of million million net of income taxes related to the call premium  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses 
the charge was recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of operations 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december the lower effective tax rate in was a result of a foreign tax credit carryforward which was recognized during the second quarter and an irs audit settlement during the third quarter 
in addition  all periods were favorably affected  as compared to the statutory rate  to varying degrees by certain global tax planning initiatives

gross margin increased in to from in the increase in consolidated gross profit and margin was driven by significantly higher gross margin in the crane segment due to increased volume and productivity gains 
in addition  the marine segment reported gross profit of million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  this was driven by profitability on new construction contracts and a strong repair year 
also  gross profit was adversely affected by a million reserve during the fourth quarter 
for a more detailed discussion of this reserve  please see the marine segment analysis below 
the foodservice segment s gross profit decreased from in to in this was primarily the result of lower sales volumes in our beverage division  higher material costs and costs related to the erp implementation 
engineering  selling and administrative es a expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by the crane and marine segments and corporate expenses 
crane segment es a increases were due to higher selling expense  increased employee related costs and increased research and development expenses 
marine segment es a increases were due to higher engineering costs  bidding costs related to potential new contracts and increased employee related costs 
corporate es a expenses increased primarily due to expensing of stock options  costs related to the unrealized acquisitions and employee related costs 
es a expenses of the foodservice segment increased slightly  primarily as a result of es a associated with the mccann s engineering mfg 
co 
mccann s operations acquisition in interest expense for the year ended december  was million versus million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from the company s redemption of the senior subordinated notes due during may of this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in the interest rate of our variable interest rate outstanding debt balances

the loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for the year ended december  reflects the operating results of our discontinued toledo ship repair operation 
the closure of toledo ship repair was completed during the first quarter of and no further results were realized from this operation 
sales and operating earnings by segment operating earnings reported below by segment include the impact of reductions due to restructurings and plant consolidation costs  whereas these expenses were separately identified in the results of consolidated operations table above 
cranes and related products segment net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to crane segment net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion versus billion for the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased over the prior year in all of our major geographic regions 
the crane segment continues to benefit from strong crane end market demand 
from a product line standpoint  the sales increase was driven by increased volume of crawler  tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  and increases in our aftermarket sales and service business  slightly offset by decreased sales of our boom truck cranes in north america due to the softening residential housing construction market 
as of december   total crane segment backlog was billion  an increase over the december  backlog of billion and an increase over the september  backlog of billion 
for the year ended december   the crane segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  operating earnings of the crane segment were favorably affected by increased volume across all regions and all but one product line  manufacturing productivity gains  product cost takeout initiatives  and price increases where appropriate 
operating margin for the year ended december  was versus for the year ended december  strong factory performance  leveraging of fixed costs  and appropriate pricing initiatives in all our regions contributed to the gains in profit and margin  somewhat offset by higher costs of materials

operating margin for the year ended december  was versus for the year ended december  strong factory performance  leveraging of fixed costs  and favorable pricing levels in all our regions contributed to the gains in profit and margin 
foodservice equipment segment net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales increased to million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the sales increase during was driven by all divisions and the full year results of mccann s which was acquired on may  the increases were a result of both volume and pricing increases versus the prior year 
in addition  our beverage division benefited from the acquisition of mccann s  which added approximately million of sales for the full year ended december  as compared to approximately million of sales for the last half of the year ended december  for the year ended december   the foodservice segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  operating results for were improved as a result of increased volumes  appropriate pricing initiatives  and product cost takeouts 
these benefits were somewhat offset by material cost increases and higher employee and commission costs 
the mccann s acquisition benefited operating earnings by million compared to operating earnings of million 
year ended december  compared to net sales from the foodservice segment increased to million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the sales increase during was driven by our ice and refrigeration divisions and the acquisition of mccann s 
the increases in our ice and refrigeration divisions were a result of both volume and pricing increases versus the prior year 
our beverage division benefited from the acquisition of mccann s  which occurred on may  this acquisition added approximately million of sales for the year ended december  the benefit of the mccann s acquisition was offset by reduced sales in our historical beverage businesses 
the decline in the historical business was primarily attributed to two major customer equipment refresh programs which benefited net sales in but did not recur in for the year ended december   the foodservice segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  the year ended december  was impacted by a million restructuring charge recorded in connection with the consolidation of our kolpak operation located in wisconsin into our kolpak operation located in tennessee 
this action was taken in an effort to streamline our cost structure 
the charge included million to write down the facility and land  which were subsequently sold  to estimated fair market value less cost to sell  million related to the write down of certain equipment  million to write off excess inventory which was not transferred to tennessee  million related to severance and other employee related costs  and million for other related closing costs 
operating results for were adversely affected by approximately million due to increased commodity costs  specifically copper and aluminum 
the operating results of the foodservice segment for the year ended december  were also adversely affected by the lower sales of our beverage division 
mccann s contributed approximately million to operating earnings of the company 
marine segment prior year sales and operating earnings of the marine segment have been restated for the discontinued operation of toledo ship repair discontinued in the third quarter of 
net sales operating earnings loss operating margin year ended december  compared to marine segment net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  over net sales for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily the result of the construction of the first and second options of the improved navy lighterage system inls  construction of several commercial articulated tug and barge combination projects and construction of the littoral combat ship lcs for the us navy 
the marine segment reported operating earnings of million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  results for were positively impacted by continued demand for certain commercial vessels which allowed us to bid on and successfully complete repeat projects and a strong winter repair season at our sturgeon bay shipyard 
additionally  operating margins were favorably impacted by improved manufacturing performance on longer term government contracts 
year ended december  compared to net sales from our marine segment increased to million for the year ended december  over net sales for the year ended december  the increase in sales was primarily the result of revenue generated from construction of the first option of the improved navy lighterage system inls  construction of several commercial articulated tug and barge combination projects and construction of the littoral combat ship lcs 
sales for also benefited from a very strong winter repair season 
for  the marine segment reported operating earnings of million compared to a loss of million for the loss in was primarily the result of a million reserve recorded during the fourth quarter of we have been in negotiations with one of our marine customers to recover certain cost overruns that resulted from change orders related to a particular contract 
during the third quarter of  due to the fact that these negotiations were not successful within a timeframe satisfactory to us  we filed a lawsuit seeking recovery of these cost overruns from the customer 
the customer filed a counter suit against us in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we established a reserve of million to reflect the inherent uncertainties in litigation of this type 
the million reserve is recorded in cost of sales of the marine segment in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  although we have established this reserve  we believe we are contractually entitled to these cost recoveries and we are in current negotiations with this customer to obtain recovery of amounts owed 
the operating results of benefited from the completion of certain contracts in  which were fixed price contracts 
these were bid and awarded prior to the unprecedented rise in the costs of steel and other commodities during labor inefficiencies also impacted these projects in prior years 
the marine segment s contracts are now better protected against commodity cost increases due to escalation clauses 
in addition  results were also positively impacted by increased demand for certain commercial vessels which allowed us to bid on and successfully complete repeat projects with higher margins 
for  operating margins were negatively impacted by the fact that a significant percentage of the marine segment results were from a relatively low margin lcs contract  which is a first run military prototype vessel that is structured as a cost plus contract 
general corporate expenses net sales corporate expenses of net sales year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased million to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs and other professional expenses 
year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased million to million in compared to million in expensing of stock options  which began during the first quarter of  increased corporate expenses by million in compared to also contributing to the increase in corporate expenses during was approximately million of legal and accounting expenses related to the unrealized acquisitions 
finally  corporate expenses for the year ended december  were impacted by higher employee related costs and other professional expenses 
market conditions and outlook during  we will strive to protect our market shares in a profitable manner  improve our cost structures  and continue to invest in new product development 
because of our global crane businesses and our continued global growth in our foodservice businesses  during we were affected more than ever by non us world economies 
the economies of europe and asia  in particular  affect our performance 
our diversified business model  global presence  and broad product offerings proved beneficial to us in and we believe will continue to provide stability to our company into the future 
product line and geographic diversification within our segments also historically have proved to be beneficial 
cranes and related products the global crane market continued to strengthen in  which benefited most of our regional and product end markets  including our rough terrain  all terrain  crawler  and tower crane product families 
price increases to recover material cost increases  and manufacturing cost reductions have contributed to the improved gross margins in the crane segment 
in  we expect to see some additional escalation in product costs and a weaker currency in the us which we anticipate will again be mitigated across the industry with pricing actions and other cost reduction efforts 
during  based on third party data and company estimates  we grew global market share in all product families except one 
we responded to significant increases in demand in asia by acquiring our distributor and licensee and acquiring crane manufacturing capabilities in india 
the crane segment continues to invest in its manufacturing facilities in an effort to increase production volumes to meet market demand 
the improvement in overall market share is partially a reflection of continued significant investment in new products 
we introduced over a dozen new products in we will continue to invest in new products and product support and have over new product programs in process or in our project pipeline 
looking ahead  we expect sales volumes to continue to increase worldwide as most non residential global construction market segments have significant growth prospects based on third party data 
we believe the north american construction equipment market as it relates to lifting equipment in non residential applications is still strong  and we maintain a high order backlog for north american orders 
we expect asia will continue to grow significantly  driven by chinese and indian lifting market expansion 
we will work to grow our market share globally by leveraging the strength of our brand names  product service and support  and by expanding product offerings 
in  we plan to continue our development of new crane models that appeal to construction markets worldwide 
one way to achieve this growth is through the continued expansion and strategic positioning of our service and product support infrastructure in emerging markets on all continents 
our past acquisitions have given us a broad product offering and worldwide distribution 
we believe these factors along with new product introductions will help us continue to grow our business in and beyond 
we believe that our growth strategy is solid and supported by the diversification of our global manufacturing and distribution presence 
foodservice equipment our foodservice segment faces a different environment in from that of the crane segment 
this is a largely domestic us business and our key customers are restaurants  convenience stores and the lodging market 
several customers have revised their capital spending plans in response to lower consumer spending on meals outside the home and general concern over the us economy 
consumers are facing higher energy prices and uncertain economic outlook 
even in the face of market uncertainty  this segment has historically been stable 
in the past years  restaurant sales have failed to outpace inflation only three times 
foodservice equipment is a stable industry and we have a large base of installed equipment that puts us in a strong position for replacement sales 
approximately of our foodservice segment sales are due to equipment replacement and upgrade which is not dependent on new store construction 
according to the national restaurant association  the top two trends for consumers are going healthy and going green and we believe we are well positioned for both 
we continue to develop products to meet the desire for healthier menu items 
in addition  foodservice operators have long recognized our commitment to producing the most energy efficient products in the industry 
we have built on the need for green technology by advancing the use of insulation materials in manufacturing processes that minimize the use of volatile compounds and chemicals 
this movement is not only good for the environment  it creates a healthy restaurant 
we believe operators and customers are becoming more sensitive to the need for products that match a commitment to conservation 
if industry performance flattens in  we are still confident in our ability for growth because we have been developing new products  serving new markets and leveraging our relationships with national and global accounts 
marine the marine segment exceeded its expectations for  driven by commercial double hull tank barge construction work oil pollution act of and government program execution 
we delivered one articulating tug and double hull barge unit and two double hulled petroleum barges  and commenced construction on two more double hull petroleum barges 
we operated at a feverish pace in meeting our contractual requirements on the first option of the improved navy lighterage system inls  delivering six warping tugs and causeway ferries in work continued on the first littoral combat ship lcs freedom  and production commenced on the first boat of the us coast guard s response boat medium rb m program 
great lakes ship repair activity also excelled  with strong first quarter winter repair activities driving year end results 
our marine segment backlog coming into should carry us largely through the year and into we are scheduled to deliver two double hull petroleum barges  the lcs freedom  and a number of inls and rb m units in repair activity in should be quite healthy  though perhaps not quite the level it was in due to the timing of the five year coast guard mandated survey and inspection cycle 
bay shipbuilding has reservations for eight major dockings and surveys in  of which six will be completed in first quarter 
fleet utilization on the great lakes remains strong with coal and iron ore leading the way 
we expect that our customers should now be able to justify investment in replacement tonnage and in vessel revitalization projects such as re powerings  conversions and automations 
these capital decisions should also be supported by fuel savings from modern propulsion machinery and increased automation to improve manning utilization 
another sector of the market that should provide future work for marine is the re emerging oil drilling support vessel demand 
the us oil patch is in need of replacements for older vessels and the recently awarded gulf of mexico deepwater oil leases will require larger platform supply vessels psv and anchor handling towing supply vessels ahts 
alaskan north slope drilling is manifesting a demand for polar ice breaking ahts vessels  allowing marine to capitalize on its recent successful uscg ice breaker construction 
in addition  the north sea drilling market has also begun to show opportunities for us shipbuilders as currency exchange ratios more than offset initial mobilization costs 
marine  in conjunction with a principal commercial customer  is pioneering a design for a liquefied petroleum gas lpg barge that will be capable of lightering lpg ships and distributing the gas to smaller ports 
this market is in its infancy  but should hold great potential in the coming years 
marine looks forward to as another year of continued improvement in efficiency  safety  and operating earnings 
it is well positioned with a strong backlog of commercial work and it is in an excellent position to capitalize on existing and pending government contracts 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during was million compared to million in we applied a portion of this cash flow in to capital spending  dividends and payment of outstanding debt 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   an increase of million over cash flow provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  cash flow during was driven by million of net earnings  an increase of million over net earnings for during  cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventory of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was driven primarily by an increase in sales volumes  and the increase in inventory was due to higher order backlog and an increase in sales volumes  both in the crane segment 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities positively impacted cash flow from operations by million 
this was driven primarily by payables related to the increase in inventory in the crane segment 
the company is party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby it sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary which  in turn  sells participating interests in its pool of receivables to a third party financial institution purchaser 
the purchaser receives an ownership and security interest in the pool of receivables 
new receivables are purchased by the special purpose subsidiary and participation interests are resold to the purchaser as collections reduce previously sold participation interests 
the company has retained collection and administrative responsibilities on the participation interests sold 
the purchaser has no recourse against the company for uncollectible receivables  however  the company s retained interest in the receivable pool is subordinate to the purchaser s interest and is recorded at fair value 
due to a short average collection cycle of less than days for such accounts receivable and the company s collection history  the fair value of the company s retained interest approximates book value 
the retained interest recorded at december  was million  and is included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the securitization program s capacity was increased from million in to million in the third quarter of the program includes certain domestic trade accounts receivable from our us crane and foodservice businesses 
trade accounts receivables sold to the purchaser and being serviced by the company totaled million at december   an increase of million from the balance sold to the purchaser at december  we spent a total of million during for capital expenditures 
we continue to fund capital expenditures to increase production capacity  improve the cost structure of our business  to invest in new processes  products and technology  and to maintain high quality production standards 
the following table summarizes capital expenditures and depreciation by segment 
capital expenditures depreciation cranes and related products foodservice equipment marine corporate total in the third quarter of we reached an agreement with valcovna profilov as for the brownfield development of a crane manufacturing facility in saris  slovakia 
in addition  during the first quarter of we entered into agreements with a major software and systems supplier and a related consulting firm to purchase software and consulting services to begin design and implementation of an erp system in our crane segment 
to date  capital expenditures for this erp system total million

restricted cash represents cash in escrow which replaced outstanding letters of credit related to performance under a certain marine contract and security for the indemnity agreement for a casualty insurance provider 
on august   the company redeemed its senior subordinated notes due pursuant to the terms of the indenture  the company paid the note holders percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date 
as a result of this redemption  the company incurred a charge of million related to the call premium  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses 
we utilized cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility to fund this redemption 
during may  we redeemed our million euro million based on may  exchange rates senior subordinated notes due pursuant to the terms of the indenture  we paid the note holders percent of the principal amount of the notes  which included a call premium of million plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date 
we utilized cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility to fund this redemption 
the borrowings drawn on the revolving credit facility to complete this transaction were fully paid off during during the years ended december   and  we sold million  million and million  respectively  of our long term notes receivable to third party financing companies 
we guaranty varying percentages  up to  of collection of the notes to the financing companies 
we have accounted for the sales of the notes as a financing of receivables 
the receivables remain on our consolidated balance sheets  net of payments made  in other current and non current assets  and we have recognized an obligation equal to the net outstanding balance of the notes in other current and non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cash flow benefit of these transactions  net of payments made by the customer  is reflected as financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
during the years ended december   and  the customers paid million  million and million  respectively  of the notes to the third party financing companies 
as of december   and  the outstanding balance of the notes receivables guaranteed by us was million  million and million  respectively 
our outstanding debt at december  consists of million of senior notes due senior notes due  as well as outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility  working capital lines of credit in non us locations and capital leases 
our revolving credit facility provides million of initial borrowing capacity and includes the ability to access an additional million of borrowing capacity during the life of the facility under the same terms 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin  which is based on our consolidated total leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement 
the annual commitment fee in effect at december  on the unused portion of the secured revolving credit facility was 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million 
the senior notes due are unsecured senior obligations which ranked prior to our senior subordinated notes due indebtedness under our revolving credit facility ranks equally with the senior notes due  except that it is secured by substantially all domestic tangible and intangible assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
interest on the senior notes due is payable semiannually in may and november each year  the senior notes due can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after november  as of december   we also had outstanding million of other indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 
this debt includes outstanding bank overdrafts in asia and europe  and various capital leases 
as of december   we had two fixed to floating rate swap contracts which effectively converted million of our fixed rate senior notes due to variable rate debt 
these contracts are considered to be hedges against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt obligation 
accordingly  the interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as an asset of million as of december  debt is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
the fair value of these contracts  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  approximated a gain of million at december  our revolving credit facility and senior notes due contain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
in general  the covenants contained in the revolving credit facility are more restrictive than those of the senior notes due among other restrictions  these covenants require us to meet specified financial tests  which include the following consolidated interest coverage ratio  consolidated total leverage ratio  and consolidated senior leverage ratio 
these covenants also limit  among other things  our ability to redeem or repurchase our debt  incur additional debt  make acquisitions  merge with other entities  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase capital stock  and create or become subject to liens 
the revolving credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby certain defaults under any other debt agreements would result in default under the secured revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december   and based upon our current plans and outlook  we believe we will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent months of our debt position at various times increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions and results in a meaningful portion of our cash flow from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt 
this could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not subject to our control  such as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and regulatory factors 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  even after taking into account such new borrowings 
the revolving credit facility or other future facilities may be used for funding future acquisitions  seasonal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other investing and financing needs 
we believe that our available cash  revolving credit facility  cash generated from future operations  and access to public debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund our capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
management also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
our revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests to comply with the terms of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility million outstanding as of december  
further  such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes due b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we do not believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our planned activities at this time 
c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing

fin tax liabilities totaling million  including related interests and penalties  are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding uncertain income tax positions under fin at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million 
we also had buyback commitments and residual value guarantees outstanding  that if all were satisfied in full at december   the total cash cost to us would be million  this amount is not reduced for amounts the company would recover from repossessing and subsequent resale of collateral 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
the company has established the retirement plan committee the committee to manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts 
our three us pension plans had benefit accruals frozen several years ago 
effective january   we merged all us pension plans together 
the company made a contribution of million during the first quarter of that fully funded the ongoing pension liability of the us pension plans 
the company also changed its investment policy to more closely align the interest rate sensitivity of its pension plan assets with the corresponding liabilities 
the resulting asset allocation consists of approximately equities and fixed income securities 
this funding and change in allocation will remove a significant portion of the us pension s volatility arising from unpredictable changes in interest rates and investment return from the equity markets 
this decision increased the funded status of these plans  and minimized unexpected future pension cash contributions that would result from implementation of the provisions of the pension protection act 
during the second quarter of  the company made a million pension contribution to its uk defined benefit pension plan 
the million contribution funded the defined benefit plan as well as paid an incentive to certain pensioners to transfer from the defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan 
as a result of this payment  the company recorded a charge during the second quarter of of approximately million to reflect the incentive given to the pensioners and the expenses incurred 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to a withdraw liability from a multiemployer pension plan at its former river falls  wisconsin facility 
during the third quarter of  the company closed its kolpak operation located in river falls  wisconsin and consolidated it with its operation in parsons  tennessee 
the million represents the estimated payment the company will make to the multiemployer pension plan for its former union employees at the closed facility 
in  cash contributions to all pension plans by us were million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in financial risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use  please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk in  we used interest rate swaps entered into with third party financial institutions such that approximately of our debt is fixed and is floating at december  at december   we had two fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding 
these swap contracts effectively convert million of our fixed rate senior notes to variable rate debt 
under these swap agreements  we contract with a counter party to exchange the difference between a floating rate and the fixed rate applied to million of our senior notes 
these contracts are considered to be a hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate obligations 
accordingly  these interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets at december  as an asset of million  and the related debt is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the interest rate swap contract  as well as the offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the change in the fair value of the swaps exactly offsets the change in fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings from these swaps for the year ended december  a increase or decrease in the floating rate we pay under these swap agreements would not result in a significant change in pre tax interest expense 
this amount was calculated assuming the year end weighted average rate of the swaps was constant throughout the year 
interest swaps expose us to the risk that the counter party may be unable to pay amounts it owes us under the swap agreements 
to manage this risk we enter into swap agreements only with financial institutions that have high credit ratings 
commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  copper  aluminum  and other petroleum based products 
each of our business segments is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices 
we have established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices 
some of these programs are centralized across business segments  and others are specific to a business segment or business unit 
in addition to the regular negotiations of material prices with certain vendors  during we entered into certain commodity hedges that fix the price of certain of our key commodities utilized in the production of our foodservice product offerings 
at december   million net of tax of million of unrealized losses remain deferred in other comprehensive income and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next months 
currency risk we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
international sales  including those sales that originated outside of the united states  were approximately of our total sales for  with the largest percentage being sales into various european countries 
regarding transactional foreign exchange risk  we enter into limited forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates between a budgeted rate and the rate realized at the time we recognize a particular purchase or sale transaction and reduce earnings and cash flow impact on nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments either impact our consolidated statements of operations in the period of the underlying purchase or sale transaction  or offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables being hedged 
the maturities of these forward exchange contracts coincide with either the underlying transaction date or the settlement date of the related cash inflow or outflow 
the hedges of anticipated transactions are designated as cash flow hedges and the hedges of accounts receivable and accounts payable are designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts hedging anticipated transactions and future settlements of outstanding accounts receivable and accounts payable with an aggregate fair market value of million 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december  for fair value hedges would not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations as any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging accounts receivable or payable balances would be offset by equal gains or losses on the underlying receivables or payables 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december  for cash flow hedges would not have a significant impact on the date of settlement due to the insignificant amounts of such hedges 
at december   there was also a significant portion of our foreign currency translation exposure that was not hedged due to the company paying off the senior subordinated notes due during amounts invested in non us based subsidiaries are translated into us dollar at the exchange rate in effect at year end 
results of operations are translated into us dollars at an average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  is million
