item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of park ohio holdings corp 
and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the historical financial information is not directly comparable on a year to year basis  primarily due to reversals of a tax valuation allowance in and  restructuring and unusual charges in and  and acquisitions during the three years ended december  executive overview we are an industrial total supply management tm and diversified manufacturing business  operating in three segments supply technologies  aluminum products and manufactured products 
in november  our ils business changed its name to supply technologies to better reflect its breadth of services and focus on driving efficiencies throughout the total supply management process 
our supply technologies business provides our customers with total supply management tm  a proactive solutions approach that manages the efficiencies of every aspect of supplying production parts and materials to our customers manufacturing floor  from strategic planning to program implementation 
total supply management tm includes such services as engineering and design support  part usage and cost analysis  supplier selection  quality assurance  bar coding  product packaging and tracking  just in time and point of use delivery  electronic billing services and ongoing technical support 
the principal customers of supply technologies are in the heavy duty truck  automotive and vehicle parts  electrical distribution and controls  consumer electronics  power sports fitness equipment  hvac  agricultural and construction equipment  semiconductor equipment  plumbing  aerospace and defense  and appliance industries 
aluminum products casts and machines aluminum engine  transmission  brake  suspension and other components such as pump housings  clutch retainers pistons  control arms  knuckles  master cylinders  pinion housings  brake calipers  oil pans and flywheel spacers for automotive  agricultural equipment  construction equipment  heavy duty truck and marine equipment oems  primarily on a sole source basis 
aluminum products also provides value added services such as design and engineering and assembly 
manufactured products operates a diverse group of niche manufacturing businesses that design and manufacture a broad range of highly engineered products including induction heating and melting systems  pipe threading systems  industrial oven systems  injection molded rubber components  and forged and machined products 
manufactured products also produces and provides services and spare parts for the equipment it manufactures 
the principal customers of manufactured products are oems  sub assemblers and end users in the steel  coatings  forging  foundry  heavy duty truck  construction equipment  bottling  automotive  oil and gas  rail and locomotive manufacturing and aerospace and defense industries 
sales  earnings and other relevant financial data for these three segments are provided in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
sales and pre tax income continued to grow in  as growth in the manufactured products segment and new customers in the supply technologies and aluminum products segments exceeded declines in supply technologies segment sales to the heavy duty truck market caused by the introduction of new environmental standards at the beginning of new customers in the supply technologies segment came both from the october  acquisition of nabs and from organic sales  while new sales in the aluminum products segment primarily reflect new contracts 
sales increased  while operating income increased and income before income taxes increased 
net income declined in because earnings were increased by the reversal of the remaining million of the company s tax valuation allowance 
net sales increased in compared to  while operating income increased 
net income declined in because the reversal of the company s tax valuation allowance of million in was smaller than the reversal of the valuation allowance of million in  and because of higher interest expense in the tax valuation allowance was substantially eliminated by december   so no further significant reversals occurred to affect income in or are anticipated in later years 
during  net sales increased  and operating income increased as compared to operating 
table of contents income was reduced by million of restructuring charges 
million reflected in cost of products sold and million in restructuring and impairment charges 
during the years through  we reinforced our long term availability and attractive pricing of funds by refinancing both of our major sources of borrowed funds senior subordinated notes and our revolving credit facility 
in november  we sold million of senior subordinated notes due we have amended our revolving credit facility  most recently in june  to extend its maturity to december  increase the credit limit to million subject to an asset based formula and provide lower interest rate levels 
in october  we acquired all of the capital stock of nabs for million in cash 
nabs is a premier international supply chain manager of production components  providing services to high technology companies in the computer  electronics  and consumer products industries 
nabs had international operations in china  india  taiwan  singapore  ireland  hungary  scotland and mexico plus five locations in the united states 
in january  we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of foundry service gmbh for approximately million in cash  which resulted in additional goodwill of million 
the acquisition was funded with borrowings from foreign subsidiaries of the company 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of lectrotherm  which is primarily a provider of field service and spare parts for induction heating and melting systems  located in canton  ohio  for million cash funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
this acquisition augments our existing  high margin aftermarket induction business 
in july  we acquired substantially all the assets of ppg  a provider of supply chain management services for a broad range of production components for million cash funded with borrowings from our revolving credit facility  
million in a short term note payable and the assumption of approximately million of trade liabilities 
this acquisition added significantly to the customer and supplier bases  and expanded our geographic presence of our supply technologies segment 
accounting changes and goodwill on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas 
fas required the company to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the company s fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans collectively  the postretirement benefit plans in the december  consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses  unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of fas and fas  all of which were previously netted against the plans funded status in the company s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of fas and fas these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic benefit cost in accordance with the company s historical accounting policy for amortizing these amounts 
in addition  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic benefit cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income 
those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost on the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption of fas we elected to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was 
table of contents recognized 
compensation expense resulting from fixed awards of restricted shares was measured at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period 
an alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation would have been the fair value method defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
fas permitted use of the intrinsic value method and did not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
if compensation cost for stock options granted had been determined based on the fair value method of fas  our net income and diluted income per share would have been decreased by million 
per share in in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
fas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes a fair value measurement objective in determining the value of such a cost 
fas r was effective as of january  fas r is a revision of fas and supersedes apb the adoption of fair value recognition provisions for stock options increased the company s fiscal and compensation expense by million and million before tax  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  we review goodwill annually for potential impairment 
this review was performed as of october   and  using forecasted discounted cash flows  and it was determined that no impairment is required 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million of goodwill 
in  discount rates used ranged from to  and long term revenue growth rates ranging from to were used 
on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has a or less likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company adopted fin as of january  see note h to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein  for the impact on the company s financial statements and related disclosures

new customers in the supply technologies segment came from organic sales  while new sales in the aluminum products segment primarily reflect sales to new customers 
aluminum products sales increased as the sales volumes from new contracts starting production ramp up exceeded the end of production of other parts and the general decline in auto industry sales volumes 
manufactured products sales increased  primarily in the induction equipment  pipe threading equipment and forging businesses  due largely to worldwide strength in the steel  oil and gas  aerospace and rail industries 
at the end of fourth quarter  the company adjusted downward the amount initially recorded for revenue by approximately million to reflect the exclusion of certain costs from suppliers and subcontractors from the percentage of completion calculation that is used to account for long term industrial equipment contracts

based on strong recent and projected earnings  the company has determined that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax asset will be realized 
the tax valuation allowance reversals resulted in increases to net income for both of these quarters 
in  the company began recording a quarterly provision for federal income taxes  resulting in a total effective income tax rate of approximately

in  these taxes consisted of federal  state and foreign income taxes  while federal income tax was not provided in at december   our subsidiaries had million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes 
we are presenting taxes and tax rates without the tax benefit of the tax valuation allowance reversal to facilitate comparison between the periods 
liquidity and sources of capital our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our senior subordinated notes 
in  we entered into a revolving credit facility with a group of banks which  as subsequently amended  matures at december  and provides for availability of up to million subject to an asset based formula 
the revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all our assets in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
borrowings from this revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be borrowed at the company s election at either i libor plus 
to or ii the bank s prime lending rate 
the libor based interest rate is dependent on the company s debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  a detailed borrowing base formula provides borrowing availability to the company based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and approximately million of unused borrowing availability 
current financial resources working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet current cash requirements 
the future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based on the company s ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant  which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends 
failure to meet the debt service ratio could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings 

table of contents at december   the company was in compliance with the debt service ratio covenant and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  versus at december  working capital increased by million to million at december  from million at december  during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the increase in cash provision of million was primarily the result of a smaller increase in net operating assets in compared to million compared to million  respectively  a deferred income tax provision of million in compared to a million deferred tax benefit in  partially offset by a decrease in net income of million 
the decrease in net income was partially offset by approximately million of noncash restructuring and impairment charges in during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures  received million from the sale of assets held for sale  paid back million on its bank and other debt  invested million in marketable securities and purchased million of treasury stock 
during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the decrease in cash provision of million was primarily the result of a much larger increase in net operating assets  net of the impact of acquisitions  in compared to million compared to million  respectively  and a decrease in net income of million 
approximately million of the decrease in net income was due to noncash changes in deferred income taxes  partially offset by noncash restructuring and impairment charges 
during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures  received million from the sale of facilities which were subsequently leased back  received million from the sale of assets held for sale  borrowed an additional million under its revolving credit facilities and invested million in acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
there are occasions whereupon we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar 
at december   none were outstanding 
we currently have no other derivative instruments 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and other commercial commitments over various future periods as of december  payments due or commitment expiration per period less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations interest obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations postretirement obligations standby letters of credit total interest obligations are included on the senior subordinated notes due only and assume notes are paid at maturity 
the calculation of interest on debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and other variable rate debt  based on average interest rate and outstanding 
table of contents borrowings of  at december  is not included above due to the subjectivity and estimation required 
postretirement obligations include projected postretirement benefit payments to participants only through the table above excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits disclosed in note h to the consolidated financial statements  since the company cannot predict with reasonable reliability  the timing of potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
we expect that funds provided by operations plus available borrowings under our revolving credit facility to be adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  other than from long term contracts  when title is transferred to the customer  typically upon shipment 
revenue from long term contracts approximately of consolidated revenue is accounted for under the percentage of completion method  and recognized on the basis of the percentage each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated contract cost 
revenue earned on contracts in process in excess of billings is classified in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
allowances are developed by the individual operating units based on historical losses  adjusting for economic conditions 
our policy is to identify and reserve for specific collectibility concerns based on customers financial condition and payment history 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
writeoffs of accounts receivable have historically been low 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity  which is compared to estimated future usage and sales 
inventories identified by management as slow moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs 
though we consider these allowances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have a material effect on reserve allowances required 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during and  the company decided to exit certain under performing product lines and to close or consolidate certain operating facilities and  accordingly  recorded restructuring and impairment charges as discussed above and in note o to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
restructuring we recognize costs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  for charges prior to detailed contemporaneous 
table of contents documentation is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in the estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the changes 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which nullified eitf and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at the fair value only when the liability is incurred 
fas has no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to goodwill we adopted fas as of january  under fas  we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we have completed the annual impairment test as of october    and and have determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of those dates 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates 
in determining these amounts  management determined the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income and the extended period of time over which the postretirement benefits will be paid and accordingly records a tax valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized as required by fas pension and other postretirement benefit plans we and our subsidiaries have pension plans  principally noncontributory defined benefit or noncontributory defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trends 
pension plan asset performance in the future will directly impact our net income 
we have evaluated our pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions  considering current trends in interest rates and market conditions and believe our assumptions are appropriate 
stock based compensation we elected to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
compensation expense resulting from fixed awards of restricted shares was measured at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period 
an alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation would have been the fair value method defined by fas fas permits use of the intrinsic value method and did not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
if compensation cost for stock options granted had been determined based on the fair value method of fas  our net income and diluted income per share would have been decreased by million 
per share in in december  the fasb issued fas r 
fas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes a fair value measurement objective in determining the value of such a cost 
fas r was effective as of january  fas r is a revision of fas and supersedes apb the adoption of fair value recognition provisions for stock options increased the company s and compensation expense by 
million and 
million before tax  respectively

fas 
fas permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings 
entities electing the fair value option would also be required to distinguish  on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
fas is effective for the company in the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption

all changes in the parent s ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value 
fas is effective  on a prospective basis  for the company in however  presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fas on the company s financial position and results of operations 
environmental we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at third party sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state laws  which provide for strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability 
we are participating in the cost of certain clean up efforts at several of these sites 
however  our share of such costs has not been material and based on available information  our management does not expect our 
table of contents exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we have been named as one of many defendants in a number of asbestos related personal injury lawsuits 
our cost of defending such lawsuits has not been material to date and  based upon available information  our management does not expect our future costs for asbestos related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we caution  however  that inherent in management s estimates of our exposure are expected trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors that may materially vary as claims are filed and settled or otherwise resolved 
seasonality  variability of operating results our results of operations are typically stronger in the first six months than the last six months of each calendar year due to scheduled plant maintenance in the third quarter to coincide with customer plant shutdowns and due to holidays in the fourth quarter 
the timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with  among other factors  orders for customers finished goods  customer production schedules  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the variability of the level and timing of orders has  from time to time  resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our business units 
such variability is particularly evident at the capital equipment businesses  included in the manufactured products segment  which typically ship a few large systems per year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our floating rate revolving credit facility  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  our foreign subsidiaries generally conduct business in local currencies 
during  we recorded a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment of million related to net assets located outside the united states 
this foreign currency translation adjustment resulted primarily from the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar 
our foreign operations are also subject to other customary risks of operating in a global environment  such as unstable political situations  the effect of local laws and taxes  tariff increases and regulations and requirements for export licenses  the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions and transportation delays 
our largest exposures to commodity prices relate to steel and natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
we do not have any commodity swap agreements  forward purchase or hedge contracts for steel but have entered into forward purchase contracts for a portion of our anticipated natural gas usage through april
