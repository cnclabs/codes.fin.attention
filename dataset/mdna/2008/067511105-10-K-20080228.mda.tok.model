forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors above 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
unless required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as result of new information  future events or otherwise executive overview founded in  bare escentuals is one of the fastest growing prestige beauty companies in the us and a leader by sales and consumer awareness in mineral based cosmetics 
we develop  market and sell branded cosmetics and skin care products under our bareminerals  barevitamins  id  rareminerals and namesake bare escentuals brands  and professional skin care products under our md formulations brand 
we utilize a distinctive marketing strategy and a multi channel distribution model consisting of infomercials  home shopping television on qvc  premium wholesale  including sephora  ulta and department stores  company owned boutiques  spas and salons and online shopping 
we believe that this strategy provides convenience to our consumers and allows us to reach the broadest possible spectrum of consumers 
our business is comprised of two strategic business units constituting reportable segments that we manage separately based on fundamental differences in their operations our retail segment  which is characterized by sales directly to end users  includes our infomercials  which include sales through our website www 
bareminerals 
com  and company owned boutiques  which include sales through our websites www 
bareescentuals 
com and www 
mdformulations 
com 
we believe that our infomercial business helps us to build brand awareness  communicate the benefits of our core products and establish a base of recurring revenue because a substantial percentage of new consumers participate in our continuity program 
our company owned boutiques enhance our ability to build strong consumer relationships and promote additional product use through personal demonstrations and product consultations 
our wholesale segment  which is characterized by sales to resellers  includes premium wholesale  home shopping television  spas and salons  and international 
our sales through home shopping television help us to build brand awareness  educate consumers through live product demonstrations and develop close connections with our consumers 
we also sell to retailers that we believe feature our products in settings that support and reinforce our brand image and provide a premium in store experience 
similarly  our spa and salon customers provide an informative and treatment focused environment in which aestheticians and spa professionals can communicate the benefits of our core products 
finally  we sell our products in a number of major international markets including the uk  japan  france and germany as well as into smaller countries through a network of third party distributors 
we manage our business segments to maximize sales growth and market share 
we believe that our multi channel distribution strategy maximizes convenience for our consumers  reinforces brand awareness  increases consumer retention rates  and drives corporate cash flow and profitability 
further  we believe that the broad diversification within our segments provides us with expanded opportunities for growth and reduces our dependence on any single distribution channel 
within individual distribution channels  particularly those in our wholesale segment  financial results are often affected by the timing of shipments as well as the impact of key promotional events 
basis of presentation we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
the company records revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse to wholesale customers  infomercial customers and online shopping customers or when purchased by consumers at company owned boutiques  each net of estimated returns except in the case of our consignment sales 
for our consignment sales  we recognize sales  net of estimated returns  upon shipment from our consignment partners to their customers 
we recognize postage and handling charges we bill to customers as revenue upon shipment of the related merchandise 
our cost of goods sold consists of the costs associated with the sourcing of our products  including the cost of the product and associated manufacturing costs  inbound freight charges  royalties and internal transfer costs 
additionally  cost of goods sold includes postage and handling costs incurred upon shipment of merchandise 
our gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors  including changes in the relative sales mix between our business segments  changes in the mix of products sold and fluctuations in material costs 
our gross margins differ significantly between product lines and our business segments  with sales in our retail segment generally yielding higher gross margins than our wholesale segment 
these factors may cause gross profit and margins to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate that our cost of goods sold will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our total sales but will remain generally consistent with historical periods on an annual basis as a percentage of net sales depending on the mix of sales among our distribution channels 
selling  general and administrative expenses include infomercial production and media costs  advertising costs  rent and other store operating costs and corporate costs such as management salaries  information technology  professional fees  finance and accounting personnel  human resources personnel and other administrative functions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also include all of our distribution center and fulfillment costs  including all warehousing costs associated with our third party fulfillment provider and receiving and inspection costs that we do not include in cost of goods sold  which are comprised primarily of headcount related costs at our own distribution centers and at our third party fulfillment provider 
receiving and inspection costs and warehousing costs are excluded from our gross margins and  therefore  our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other companies that choose to include certain of these costs in cost of goods sold 
we are unable to provide an estimate of these costs but we believe these costs are not material 
fluctuations in selling  general and administrative expenses result primarily from changes in media and advertising expenditures  changes in fulfillment costs  which increase proportionately with net sales  particularly infomercial sales  changes in store operating costs  which are affected by the number of stores opened in a period  and changes in corporate costs such as for headcount and infrastructure to support our operations 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expect to continue to invest in our corporate infrastructure and incur increased expenses to support sales growth 
depreciation and amortization includes charges for the depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of intangible assets 
we anticipate that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to open new boutiques  invest in information systems and amortize intangible assets in connection with our recent acquisition 
we record our depreciation and amortization as a separate line item in our statement of operations because all such expense relates to selling  general and administrative costs 
stock based compensation includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options and stock purchases 
on january  we adopted the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is applicable to stock based awards exchanged for employee services and in certain circumstances for board service by our nonemployee directors 
pursuant to sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method  as provided by sfas r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this transitional method  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption using grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards as of january  using the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas we anticipate that our stock based compensation expense will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grant additional options in the future 
we record our stock based compensation on a separate operating expense line item in our statement of operations due to the fact that  to date  all of our stock based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified as selling  general and administrative costs 
as of december   we had options to purchase  shares of our common stock outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of per share   shares of which were exercisable at december  interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facilities and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with these credit facilities 
we anticipate that our interest expense in the future will decrease in absolute terms and as a percentage of net sales as we continue to make scheduled payments of our outstanding indebtedness 
provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products 
historically  we have only been subject to taxation in the united states because we have either sold to consumers in the united states or sold to distributors in the united states who resold our products here and abroad 
however  as a result of our acquisition of uk based cosmeceuticals in the second fiscal quarter of  we began to sell our products directly to consumers located outside of the united states  and we became subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where those sales took place 
our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly 
for fiscal  we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately of our income before provision for income taxes 
our fiscal year end is the sunday closest to december based on a week year 
each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with an extra week added onto the fourth quarter every five or six years 
the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   each contained weeks

as amended  the registration statement provided for the sale of million shares of our common stock  consisting of million shares sold by us and million shares by selling stockholders 
in addition  the selling stockholders granted the underwriters the right to purchase up to an additional million shares to cover over allotments 
the over allotment option was exercised on march  by the underwriters 
the follow on underwritten public offering closed on march  we received approximately million in net proceeds from this offering 
on april   we completed our acquisition of uk based cosmeceuticals limited cosmeceuticals  which distributes our bare escentuals bareminerals  md formulations and md forte brands primarily to spas and salons and qvc uk the acquired entity has been renamed bare escentuals uk ltd 
the consideration for the purchase was cash of million  comprised of million in cash consideration and million of transaction costs 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the business acquired from the date of acquisition

with the securities and exchange commission for a follow on underwritten public offering 
as amended  the registration statement provided for the sale of million shares of our common stock  consisting of million shares sold by us and million shares by selling stockholders 
the follow on underwritten public offering closed on june  we received approximately million in net proceeds from this offering 
liquidity sources  requirements and contractual cash requirement and commitments we believe that cash flow from operations  cash on hand and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to invest in making improvements to our system 
we opened eighteen boutiques in and we plan to open approximately thirty five new boutiques in  which will require additional capital expenditures 
additionally  we also plan to continue to invest in our corporate infrastructure facilities 
we also intend to acquire or invest in businesses or products complementary to our own 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures in the year ending december  will be approximately million 
there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to fund our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
contractual commitments we lease retail stores  warehouses  corporate offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through march portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the tables below based on their respective us dollar exchange rates as of december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as of december   the scheduled maturities of our long term contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period years years after years total amounts in millions operating leases  net of sublease income principal payments on long term debt  including the current portion interest payments on long term debt  including the current portion minimum royalties under licensing arrangements total for purposes of the table  interest expense is calculated after giving effect to our interest rate swap as follows i during the first year of the two year term of the swap agreement  interest expense is based on million of our first lien term loan and based on the fixed rate of the swap of plus a margin of and interest expense on the remaining amount of the loan is estimated based on the rate in effect as of december  and ii during the second year of the two year term of the swap agreement  interest expense is based on million of our first lien term loan and based on the fixed rate of the swap of plus a margin of and interest expense on the remaining amount of the loan is estimated based on the rate in effect as of december  and iii after the two year term of the swap agreement  interest expense on the loan is estimated for all periods based on the rate in effect as of december  a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt  including the effect of the interest rate swap  would result in a change of million in our total interest payments  of which million would be in years and million would be in years we are also party to a sublicense agreement for use of certain patents associated with certain of our mineral based skin care products 
the agreement requires that we pay a quarterly royalty of of the net sales of these skin care products up to the date of the last to expire licensed patent rights 
this sublicense also requires minimum annual royalty payments of approximately million for and thereafter 
the minimum annual royalty payments have not been included in the schedule of long term contractual obligations above as we can terminate the agreement at any time with six months written notice 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  as of december   we had approximately million of total unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the expiration of various statutes of limitation  it is reasonably possible that the company s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to million 
as of december   the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate was million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  are not significantly affected by inflation because they are short term in nature 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of inventory  intangible assets  goodwill and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not currently significantly affected by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of goods sold and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the products offered by us 
in addition  an inflationary environment could materially increase the interest rates on our debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and  as such  requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and the assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
we record revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers except in the case of consignment sales  including those to qvc and certain distributors  infomercial customers and online shopping customers  or when purchased by consumers at company owned boutiques  each net of estimated returns 
for our consignment sales to qvc and certain distributors  we recognize sales  net of estimated returns  upon their shipments to the customer 
postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as revenue upon shipment of the related merchandise 
state and local taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider ourselves a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting state and local sales taxes 
shipping terms are fob shipping point  and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at retail locations 
for consignment sales to qvc and certain distributors  title passes to qvc and certain distributors concurrent with their shipments to its customers 
sales are reported on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received  discounts and an amount established for anticipated product returns 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns  estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events 
consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns 
our standard terms for retail sales  including infomercial sales and sales at company owned boutiques  limit returns to approximately to days after the sale of the merchandise 
for our wholesale segment  as is customary in the beauty industry  we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved 
as a percentage of gross sales  returns were  and in the years ended december   december  and january   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their invoices to us in full 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay  aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history with each customer 
we make estimates and judgments about the inability of customers to pay the amount they owe us  which could change significantly if their financial condition changes or the economy in general deteriorates 
inventories inventories consist of finished goods and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a weighted average basis 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record write downs for excess and obsolete inventories and shrinkage based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
this methodology is significantly affected by our sales forecast 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional write downs for excess or obsolete inventories may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including equipment and leasehold improvements and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
determining if such events or changes in circumstances have occurred is subjective and requires the exercise of judgment 
if we determine such events have occurred  we then determine whether such assets are recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted net cash flows 
if future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  we write down that asset to its fair value 
we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair value 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated future cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
additionally  changes in estimated future cash flows could result in a shortening of estimated useful lives for long lived assets including intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other purchased intangible assets have been recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized  but rather are subject to an annual impairment test 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years 
we are required to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests  we perform the impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at that date 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of our reporting units  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units  as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by corporate 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  an impairment may exist  and we must perform the second step of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value to determine the impairment charge  if any 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit 
in addition  we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective approach  which requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
our calculation of stock based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions  including the fair value of our common stock  future forfeitures  stock price volatility  expected life of the options and related tax effects 
prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of factors  most significantly the use of periodic contemporaneous valuations performed by a third party valuation firm 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock is based on companies of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
derivative financial instruments we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past results of operations and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
deferred tax expense results from the change in the net deferred tax asset or liability between periods 
effective january   the we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in connection with the adoption of fin  we changed our accounting policy and now recognize accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
these amounts were previously classified in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we are subject to routine audits by federal and state tax authorities that may result in additional tax liabilities 
several factors drive the calculation of our tax liabilities including  i the expiration of various statutes of limitations  ii changes in tax law and regulations  iii issuance of tax rulings  and iv settlements with tax authorities 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments in our liabilities  which would impact our reported financial results 
new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
statement also applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  but does not require any new fair value measurements 
the provisions of statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt statement during our fiscal year ending december  we are currently in the process of determining the impact  if any  of adopting the provisions of statement on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments  and certain other items  at fair value 
statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the provisions of statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt statement during our fiscal year ending december  we are currently in the process of determining the impact  if any  of adopting the provisions of statement but it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab amends and replaces question of section d 
of topic  share based payment  of the staff accounting bulletin series 
question of section d 
of topic expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options and allows usage of the simplified method for share option grants prior to december  sab allows public companies which do not have historically sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate to continue to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share option grants after december  we are required to adopt sab on january  we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
statement r will significantly change the accounting for future business combinations after adoption 
statement r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquired business 
statement r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
statement r is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt statement r beginning in our fiscal year ending january   as required 
we are currently evaluating the impact statement r will have on our financial position or results of operations  when it becomes effective 
selected quarterly results of operations the following selected quarterly data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
this information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  reflect all recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present our financial information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes 
we use a to week fiscal quarter ending on the last sunday of the quarter 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
the sum of quarterly earnings per share may differ from the full year amounts due to rounding  or in the case of diluted earnings per share  because securities that are anti dilutive in certain quarters may not be anti dilutive on a full year basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities 
we have reduced our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by entering into an interest rate swap agreement covering a portion of our variable rate debt 
in august  we entered into a two year interest rate swap transaction under our senior secured credit facilities 
the interest rate swap has an initial notional amount of million declining to million after one year under which  on a net settlement basis  we will make monthly fixed rate payments at the rate of and the counterparty makes monthly floating rate payments based upon one month usd libor 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding during the year ended december  were million and the annual effective interest rate for the period was  after giving effect to the interest swap agreement 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a million change to our interest expense in the year ended december   excluding the effect of the interest rate swap 
foreign currency risk most of our sales  expenses  assets  liabilities and cash holdings are currently denominated in us dollars but a portion of the net revenues we receive from sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our costs of goods sold and other operating expenses are incurred by our foreign operations and denominated in local currencies 
while fluctuations in the value of these net revenues  costs and expenses as measured in us dollars have not materially affected our results of operations historically  we cannot assure you that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material impact in the future 
in addition  our balance sheet reflects non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities which can be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks  and we currently believe that our foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
