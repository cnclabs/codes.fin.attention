overview founded in  we are the world s largest publicly owned creator  manufacturer and distributor of social expression products 
headquartered in cleveland  ohio  we employ approximately  associates around the world and are home to one of the world s largest creative studios 
our major domestic greeting card brands are american greetings  carlton cards and gibson and other domestic products include designware party goods  plus mark gift wrap and boxed cards  dateworks calendars and agi in store formerly agi schutz display fixtures 
we also create and license our intellectual properties such as the care bear and strawberry shortcake characters 
the internet and wireless business unit  ag interactive  is a leading provider of electronic greetings and other content for the digital marketplace 
as of february   the retail operations segment owned and operated card and gift retail stores throughout north america 
our international operations include wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom uk  canada  australia  new zealand and mexico  as well as licensees in approximately other countries 
our business exhibits seasonality  which is typical for most companies in the retail industry 
sales are higher in the second half of our fiscal year due to the concentration of major holidays during that period 
net earnings are highest during the months of september through december when sales volume provides significant operating leverage 
working capital requirements needed to finance operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as inventory is increased in preparation for the peak selling season 
two years ago we launched an operating strategy focused on investing in growth through improving the core greeting card business investment in cards strategy 
as we noted in our annual report on form k  we estimated that we would spend at least million over two years for the combination of the investment in cards strategy and scan based trading sbt implementations 
the investment in cards strategy is focused on improving the design  production  display and promotion of our cards  creating relevant and on trend products  brought to market quickly and merchandised in a manner that enhances the shopping experience 
the most significant costs associated with this strategy are incentive allowances for new fixtures and removal of product at retail to improve productivity  as credits issued to customers exceed new product shipments 
due to the nature of these costs  generally sales incentives and credits for removed product  they are reported as reductions to net sales 
in addition  there are costs to implement the strategy  including installation services  information system improvements  point of purchase materials  scrap and order filling costs  which are reported within the appropriate expense lines of the consolidated statement of income 
the investment in cards strategy and sbt implementation activities have significantly reduced our sales and operating earnings over the past two years 
for the year ended february   total revenue was reduced by approximately million for actions related to our investment in cards strategy and approximately million for sbt implementations  compared to approximately million and million  respectively  in the prior year 
other related costs to implement the strategy were approximately million in the current year  compared to approximately million in the prior year  none of which were individually significant 
in total  actions related to our investment in cards strategy and sbt implementations reduced current year consolidated pre tax income by approximately million  compared with approximately million in the prior year  for a total of million in the two year period as expected 
through the investment in cards strategy  we have reset thousands of retailers stores with new products and fixtures and also placed new cards in tens of thousands of retailers stores 
the goal of the strategy was to drive sales improvement and our card units and sales are beginning to track to our expectations 
while this two year initiative has been completed  many of the processes  activities and lessons learned in implementing the strategy have become embedded in our business model and methodology for bringing products to market 
going forward  our focus will be on creative content  product freshness and merchandising 
we were impacted during the year by an unexpected challenge created by the weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
historically  most of our products have been dual priced  with both the us and canadian currency prices printed on them 
with the parity of the currency exchange rates  we have encountered some challenges in the marketplace 
to address these challenges  we have created a new canadian line of single priced products 
the impact on the company of this situation has been a temporary reduction in revenues due to promotional activities and a temporary increase in costs to create  manufacture and distribute the new product line 
through our ag interactive business  we made two acquisitions during the year  webshots and photoworks 
these acquisitions will provide us with entry into the online photo sharing space  a significant number of unique visitors and a platform to provide consumers the ability to use their own photos to create unique  high quality physical products  including greeting cards  calendars  photo albums and photo books 
our overall photo strategy is designed to bring together the strengths of both acquisitions  and then leverage the users across all of our existing websites 
this integration  which is currently in process  should also enhance our online advertising model by driving consumer traffic across all our websites 
in addition  we are developing products to link our websites and our retail stores 
looking forward to fiscal  we are concerned about the strength of the us economy and the ensuing impact it may have on our retail partners and our consumers 
depending on how our retail partners are impacted by weakness in the economy  including consumer foot traffic at retail and potential changes to consumer discretionary purchasing patterns  we could see events such as retailer consolidation or store closures impacting our results 
we recognized net income of million in compared to million in  on total revenue of billion in compared to billion in the lower consolidated revenues were the result of reductions in all segments except the international social expression products segment  partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency movements 
revenues in the north american social expression products segment declined primarily due to the prior year divestiture of the candle product lines and lower sales of gift packaging products  partially offset by lower costs related to our investment in cards strategy 
we also had lower revenues in our retail operations segment  despite positive year over year comparative store sales growth  due to a reduced number of stores 
our ag interactive segment also had lower revenues driven by the reduced offerings in the mobile products group  partially offset by revenues from the photo acquisitions and increased memberships in the core online greeting card product line 
the revenue improvement in the international social expression products segment was primarily driven by additional distribution obtained during the year 
the improvement to pre tax earnings was driven by a change in the mix of product sold to a richer mix as defined by higher gross margins of card versus non card products  a favorable shift in business mix  the impact of continued cost savings programs  particularly in the areas of manufacturing and supply chain  and lower interest expense 
within the segments  the international social expression products segment and the retail operations segment saw dramatic improvement over the prior year 
the international improvement was driven by operations in the uk where expanded distribution  product mix and cost savings initiatives in manufacturing and supply chain drove favorable results 
the improvement within the retail operations segment was due to the impact of closing underperforming stores in the prior year  same store sales growth  improvements in product mix and cost reductions 
the prior year results included a gain of approximately million as a result of retailer consolidations  wherein  multiple long term supply agreements were terminated and a new agreement was negotiated with a new legal entity with substantially different terms and sales commitments 
we received cash of approximately million during the fourth quarter of as a result of this transaction 
the prior year also included a pre tax loss of approximately million in connection with the sale of our candle product lines and a pre tax charge of approximately million related to the closing of underperforming retail stores 
during  we repurchased million of our class a common shares under share repurchase programs for million compared to million shares for million in the prior year

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  this business unit has been reclassified into continuing operations for all periods presented 
these reclassifications had no material impact on earnings or cash flows

the mix impact was accentuated by the increase in card sales and the significant reduction of non card sales  primarily as a result of the sale of our candle product lines in january and lower sales of gift packaging products 
the increased spending is attributable to higher sbt scrap and shrink costs  which continue to increase as more customers are moved to the sbt business model  as well as higher expenses associated with our production of film based entertainment  which is used to support our merchandise licensing strategies by increasing the awareness of our properties within the target audience

the store closures resulted in exit costs in the prior year million and reduced store expenses million  including rent  depreciation and personnel costs  in the current year 
the reduced offerings in the mobile products group drove lower current year marketing related expenses in ag interactive million

as a result of those activities  certain additional expenses were incurred in  such as the write off of deferred financing fees  which did not recur in also  certain expenses were reduced in the current year due to the activities such as commitment fees  which decreased as a result of the reduced availability under the term loan facility

these purchase orders typically do not include long term volume commitments  are based on pricing terms previously negotiated with vendors and are generally cancelable with the appropriate notice prior to receipt of the materials or supplies 
accordingly  the foregoing table excludes open purchase orders for such products  materials and supplies as of february  our senior notes due on august  may be put back to us on august   at the option of the holders  at of the principal amount provided the holders exercise this option between july  and august  as such  this amount is included in the column in the above table

refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of the critical areas that required a higher degree of judgment or are considered complex 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations evidenced by such events as bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings  a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably expect will be collected 
in addition  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs and current economic conditions 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although we consider these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the retail markets in which we operate could have a material effect on the required allowance balances 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized  but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we complete the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter 
to test for goodwill impairment  we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units 
while we use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing  our primary methods are discounted cash flows and a market based analysis 
we estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates 
changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
deferred costs in the normal course of our business  we enter into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products 
we view such agreements as advantageous in developing and maintaining business with our retail customers 
the customer typically receives a combination of cash payments  credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned as product is purchased from us over the stated time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment 
these agreements are negotiated individually to meet competitive situations and therefore  while some aspects of the agreements may be similar  important contractual terms may vary 
in addition  the agreements may or may not specify us as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer 
although risk is inherent in the granting of advances  we subject such customers to our normal credit review 
we maintain a general allowance for deferred costs based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
in instances where we are aware of a particular customer s inability to meet its performance obligation  we record a specific allowance to reduce the deferred cost asset to an estimate of its future value based upon expected performance 
losses attributed to these specific events have historically not been material 
for contractual arrangements that are based upon a minimum purchase volume commitment  we periodically review the progress toward the volume commitment and estimate future sales expectations for each customer 
factors that can affect our estimate include store door openings and closings  retail industry consolidation  amendments to the agreements  consumer shopping trends  addition or deletion of participating products and product productivity 
based upon our review  we may modify the remaining amortization periods of individual agreements to reflect the changes in the estimates for the attainment of the minimum volume commitment in order to align amortization expense with the periods benefited 
we do not make retroactive expense adjustments to prior fiscal years as amounts  if any  have historically not been material 
the aggregate average remaining life of our contract base is years 
the accuracy of our assessments of the performance related value of a deferred cost asset related to a particular agreement and of the estimated time period of the completion of a volume commitment is based upon our ability to accurately predict certain key variables such as product demand at retail  product pricing  customer viability and other economic factors 
predicting these key variables involves uncertainty about future events  however  the assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning 
if the deferred cost assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to not be recoverable through performance  such assets are written down as appropriate 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we assess whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
the assumptions used in this assessment are consistent with our internal planning 
a valuation allowance is recorded against those deferred tax assets determined to not be realizable based on our assessment 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or decreased in the future if our assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies change 
sales returns we provide for estimated returns of seasonal cards and certain other seasonal products in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical sales returns  the amount of current year seasonal sales and other known factors 
estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience 
however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and or its market 
we regularly monitor our actual performance to estimated rates and the adjustments attributable to any changes have historically not been material

factors that may affect future results certain statements in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use such words as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available information  but are subject to a variety of uncertainties  unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment  which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements  and that could adversely affect our future financial performance  include  but are not limited to  the following a weak retail environment  retail consolidations  acquisitions and bankruptcies  including the possibility of resulting adverse changes to retail contract terms  competitive terms of sale offered to customers  the ability to successfully implement our strategy to invest in our core greeting card business  the timing and impact of investments in new retail or product strategies as well as new product introductions and achieving the desired benefits from those investments  consumer acceptance of products as priced and marketed  the impact of technology on core product sales  the timing and impact of converting customers to a scan based trading model  escalation in the cost of providing employee health care  the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions  the ability to successfully implement  or achieve the desired benefits associated with any information systems refresh we may implement  the ability to execute share repurchase programs or the ability to achieve the desired accretive effect from such repurchases  the ability to comply with our debt covenants  our ability to successfully complete  or achieve the desired benefits associated with  dispositions  fluctuations in the value of currencies in major areas where we operate  including the us dollar  euro  us pound sterling and canadian dollar  and the outcome of any legal claims known or unknown 
risks pertaining specifically to ag interactive include the viability of online advertising  subscriptions as revenue generators  the public s acceptance of online greetings and other social expression products  and the ability to gain a leadership position in the digital photo sharing space 
the risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us 
should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information concerning the risks we face and issues that could materially affect our financial performance related to forward looking statements  refer to the risk factors section included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments during  we entered into an interest rate derivative designed to offset the interest rate risk related to the forecasted issuance of million of senior indebtedness 
the interest rate derivative agreement expired during the year 
we did not designate this agreement as a hedging instrument pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the change in fair value of this agreement was recognized and included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of income in we have no derivative financial instruments as of february  interest rate exposure we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
currently  the majority of our debt is carried at fixed interest rates 
therefore  our overall interest rate exposure risk is minimal 
based on our interest rate exposure on our non fixed rate debt as of and during the year ended february   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on interest expense 
under the terms of our current credit agreement  we have the ability to borrow significantly more floating rate debt  which  if incurred could have a material impact on interest expense in a fluctuating interest rate environment 
foreign currency exposure our international operations expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated into us dollars 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of international subsidiaries to us dollars could affect comparability of results between years 
approximately  and of our  and total revenue from continuing operations  respectively  were generated from operations outside the united states 
operations in australasia  canada  mexico  the european union and the uk are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
no assurance can be given that future results will not be affected by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates
