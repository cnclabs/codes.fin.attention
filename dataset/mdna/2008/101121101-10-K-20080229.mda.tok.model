item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  principally  but not only  under the captions business business and growth strategies  risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report  or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time  are based on management s beliefs and on assumptions made by  and information currently available to  management 
when used  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  may  might  plan  project  result should  will  and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance  which may be affected by known and unknown risks  trends  uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may differ materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected by the forward looking statements 
we caution you that  while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them  they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements 
we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
accordingly  investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements  which are based on results and trends at the time they are made  to anticipate future results or trends 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include  among others  the following general risks affecting the real estate industry including  without limitation  the inability to enter into or renew leases  dependence on tenants financial condition  and competition from other developers  owners and operators of real estate  failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully  
table of contents risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction including  without limitation  construction delays  cost overruns  inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities  risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments  including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and or availability of financing  risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements  risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies  increases in interest rates  and volatility in the securities markets  risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks  costs of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other similar laws  potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination  risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws  the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period to period comparisons of financial results  risks associated with possible state and local tax audits  and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report  including part i  item a risk factors  include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on form q for future periods and current reports on form k as we file them with the sec  and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on form k or otherwise 
overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in five markets boston  midtown manhattan  washington  dc  san francisco and princeton  nj 
we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  the costs of tenant improvements  current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes  our current and anticipated vacancy  current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors 
we also generate cash through the sale of assets  which may be either non core assets or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors 
the impact of the current state of the economy  including rising unemployment and constrained capital  on our company is unknown 
our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants 
historically  this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles and  based on our current occupancy and recent 
table of contents leasing success  lack of available supply in our markets and limited lease rollover  we believe we are well positioned to withstand a slowing economy 
the state of the debt capital markets is continuing to deteriorate with many lenders  including cmbs providers  out of the market and others such as banks and life insurance companies tightening their credit standards and cautiously allocating capital 
we believe our current liquidity  including our cash balances and the availability under our million line of credit  is sufficient to meet our foreseeable capital needs and helps to insulate us from the difficulties in the capital markets 
in fact  we believe that  given our strong balance sheet and liquidity  we will have opportunities to capitalize on the current environment and we intend to seek acquisitions of high quality real estate at attractive returns 
although we intend to pursue such acquisitions  we continue to believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be greater than those we can expect from acquisitions 
since the beginning of we have completed over billion of asset sales and have redeployed a significant amount of the proceeds into our development pipeline 
we started approximately billion of developments in  including commencing construction on our approximately million square foot office tower in new york city at west th street and on our  square foot mixed use russia wharf development in boston 
we entered with an active development program of approximately billion  and although we will consider additional asset sales  we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years and we currently do not have any assets on the market 
we believe our focus on new development will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service in  and update on recent regulatory initiatives on august   the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position no 
apb a accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement the proposed fsp that would require the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the proposed fsp  if issued as currently contemplated  would require that the initial debt proceeds from the sale of boston properties limited partnership s bplp million of exchangeable senior notes due and million of exchangeable senior notes due be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding ie  through the first optional redemption dates as additional non cash interest expense 
the proposed fsp would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  and it would be applied retrospectively to bplp s outstanding exchangeable senior notes for all periods presented 
based on our current understanding of the application of the proposed fsp  this would result in an aggregate of approximately million net of incremental capitalized interest of additional non cash interest expense for fiscal excluding the impact of capitalized interest  the additional non cash interest expense would be approximately million to million  and this amount before netting will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the first optional redemption dates as the debt accretes to its par value over the same period 
there can be no assurance that the proposed fsp will be issued in the form currently contemplated by the fasb  or at all  and therefore its ultimate impact on our interest expense may differ materially from the aforementioned estimate 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is 
table of contents possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 

table of contents sfas no 
requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after the determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary 
revenue recognition base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 

table of contents our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  following the initiation of a lease  we continue to actively monitor the tenant s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value 
when assessing tenant credit quality  we review relevant financial information  including financial ratios  net worth  debt to market capitalization  and liquidity  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team  and assess the strength growth of the tenant s industry 
as a result of the underwriting process  tenants are then categorized into one of three categories low risk tenants  the tenant s credit is such that we require collateral  in which case we require a security deposit  and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments  or the tenant s credit is below our acceptable parameters 
we maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease 
tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of with a rating of representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of representing the lowest credit rating  recording a full reserve against the receivable balance 
among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include payment history  credit status and change in status credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric  change in tenant space needs ie  expansion downsize  tenant financial performance  economic conditions in a specific geographic region  and industry specific credit considerations 
if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and frequent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue 
table of contents reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue issue requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with issue our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 
we receive management and development fees from third parties 
management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
we review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project 
profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments for purposes of disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and at december   and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio of  and properties  respectively the total property portfolio 
as a result of changes within our total property portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period 
accordingly  we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the total 
table of contents property portfolio are necessarily meaningful 
therefore  the comparisons of operating results for the years ended  and show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared the same property portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in properties acquired  sold  repositioned and placed in service 
in our analysis of operating results  particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful  it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented 
we refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio 
the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service  acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented 
net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of minority interest  minority interest in operating partnership  losses from early extinguishments of debt  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  general and administrative expense  less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations net of minority interest  income from discontinued operations net of minority interest  gains on sales of real estate and other assets net of minority interest  income from unconsolidated joint ventures  minority interest in property partnerships  interest and other income and development and management services revenue 
we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
therefore  we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations 
further  we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because  when compared across periods  noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
noi excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property s results of operations 
for example  interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level 
in addition  depreciation and amortization  because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  may distort operating performance at the property level 
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio

these awards the opp awards are part of a new broad based long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure 
opp awards utilize total return to shareholders trs over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period subject to acceleration in certain events as a retention tool 
recipients of opp awards will share in an outperformance pool if our trs  including both share appreciation and dividends  exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from february  to february   based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of for the five trading days prior to and including february  the aggregate reward that recipients of all opp awards can earn  as measured by the outperformance pool  is subject to a maximum cap of million  although opp awards for an aggregate of up to approximately million have been allocated to date and were granted on february  the balance remains available for future grants 
we expect that under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment the opp awards will have an aggregate value of approximately million  which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five year plan period although awards for retirement eligible employees will be amortized over a three year period 
because the opp awards requires a sustained price target to achieve the threshold stock price  unless the target has actually been met by the end of the applicable reporting period  we will exclude all contingently issueable shares from the diluted eps calculation

restricted stock and ltip units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments 
such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period 
ltip units that were issued in january and any future ltip unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
to the extent restricted stock or ltip units are forfeited prior to vesting  the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation 
stock based compensation associated with approximately million of restricted stock and ltip units granted in february and approximately million of restricted stock and ltip units granted in january will be incurred ratably over the four year vesting period

base rental revenue  recovery income from tenants  other income from operations  available cash balances  draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification 

table of contents we seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
consequently  we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from financing activities  will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments  possible property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements

we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities  to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs 
we generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by bplp  our operating partnership  until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved 
to the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions  we would  at the appropriate time  decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend  adopt a stock repurchase program  reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities 
such a decision will depend on many factors including  among others  the timing  availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities  our then current and anticipated leverage  the price of our common stock and reit distribution requirements 
at a minimum  we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales
