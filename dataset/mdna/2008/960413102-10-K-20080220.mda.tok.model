item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated products 
our two principal business segments are olefins and vinyls 
we use the majority of our internally produced basic chemicals to produce higher value added chemicals and fabricated products 
consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly over the past years 
our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value added chemical products used in many end markets 
petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies 
the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics  and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates  the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials 
the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply  leading to high operating rates and margins  followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of significant capacity additions 
due to the significant size of new plants  capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed 
in and  the olefins and vinyls markets began a cyclical recovery and operating rates and margins rose as economic growth improved and excess capacity was absorbed 
these factors resulted in increased industry product margins in  and in  however  weakness in the housing market contributed to lower demand  and operating margins have declined in our vinyls business 
the demand for olefins products has remained strong in largely due to balanced industry supply and demand fundamentals for polyethylene and strong export demand  but margins have weakened due to increased feedstock costs 
pvc industry operating rates dropped from in the third quarter of to an estimated in this downturn  which impacts our vinyls segment  was primarily due to weakness in the construction market which started in september and continued through looking forward  north american pvc capacity is projected to increase by in and in total demand for pvc is expected to be flat in and increase by in as a result  operating rates and margins may not improve and could decline further from levels 
some olefins industry forecasts show a per year increase in worldwide ethylene capacity over the next three years  with the largest increase in the middle east and asia 
world demand is expected to grow per year during this period 
as a result  our olefins segment could be impacted as operating rates in the us could decline during the remainder of the decade 
we purchase significant amounts of ethane and propane feedstock  natural gas  chlorine and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains 
we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes 
while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane and propane feedstocks  natural gas  chlorine  salt and electricity  the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future  include shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand  capacity constraints due to construction delays  strike action or involuntary shutdowns  the general level of business and economic activity  and the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 
significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers may seek 
table of contents 
index to financial statements relief in the form of lower sales prices 
we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs 
normally  there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived 
when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship 
our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity  our efficient use of the capacity and our ability to increase our capacity 
since our inception  we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions  new plant construction and internal expansion 
we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs 
on november   we closed the acquisition of eastman chemical company s polyethylene business  related assets and a mile  inch pipeline from mont belvieu  texas to longview  texas  all of which are headquartered in longview  texas 
the purchase price was million in cash  after working capital adjustments 
the polyethylene business and associated operating facility has a capacity of  million pounds per year of polyethylene 
this capacity is comprised of million pounds per year of low density polyethylene ldpe and million pounds of linear low density polyethylene lldpe and high density polyethylene hdpe 
with this acquisition  our total polyethylene capacity is now billion pounds per year 
we also acquired technology for the production of specialty polyolefin polymers including acrylate co polymers  a specialty polyethylene wax for the adhesives  coatings and other consumer products markets  and energx technology for lldpe  which is designed to provide enhanced strength and performance properties 
we believe that the acquisition of these assets is an excellent strategic fit  has further strengthened our position in the north american polyethylene market and will increase our ability to provide an improved overall product mix and new technology 
in addition  during and  we purchased additional interests in suzhou huasu plastics co 
ltd  our joint venture in china 
we increased our ownership percentage from approximately to approximately at a cost of million 
we will continue to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting because the entity does not meet the definition of a variable interest entity under fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december an interpretation of arb no 
 and because contractual arrangements allowing certain substantive participatory rights to minority shareholders prevent us from exercising a controlling financial interest over this entity 
in  we announced that we had entered into a memorandum of understanding to develop an ethane based ethylene  polyethylene and other derivatives project in the republic of trinidad and tobago 
the government of the republic of trinidad and tobago the government expressed an interest in becoming a minority equity partner in the project 
as envisioned  the project would use  barrels per day of ethane to produce  metric tons billion pounds per year of ethylene  which would in turn be used to produce polyethylene and other derivative products 
the project could be expanded in the future as more ethane becomes available 
the project would be financed through a project financing arrangement 
the size  scope  cost and economics of the project are subject to further definition in connection with a detailed feasibility study that we are currently performing 
one of the major constraints to the project is the rising international capital costs of the construction of such plants around the world 
we and the government are discussing how to overcome that challenge 
in the second quarter of  we completed a major maintenance turnaround in calvert city 
the ethylene and vcm units at calvert city were down for days while the chlor alkali and pvc units were down for a shorter period 
sales continued during the turnaround from inventory on hand 
in early september  we encountered mechanical problems with a compressor and related equipment at one of our ethylene units in lake charles  louisiana  resulting in an unscheduled shutdown of that unit 
while that unit was down  we completed a maintenance turnaround of that unit that was scheduled for early during the unit s shut down  we also

net income in was positively impacted by a tax benefit of million  or per diluted share  related to a reduction in deferred taxes due to a change in apportionment ratios upon the reorganization of several subsidiaries 
sales for the year ended december  increased from sales of  million to  million  primarily due to higher sales volumes for polyethylene 
the significant increase in polyethylene sales for was primarily a result of the additional volume from the longview acquisition and was partially offset by lower average sales prices for our products 
income from operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the results have been negatively impacted by a number of factors  including a slowdown in construction and a dramatic drop in margins that began early in the fourth quarter of our olefins segment maintained strong demand in largely due to balanced industry supply and demand fundamentals for polyethylene and strong export demand 
olefins margins  however  were negatively impacted by rising feedstock costs and a trading loss of million in compared to a trading gain of million in income from operations benefited from earnings from our longview facility which was acquired in november our vinyls segment margins deteriorated throughout primarily due to the industry s inability to raise prices in the downstream products in order to cover the significant increase in feedstock costs

index to financial statements vinyls segment net sales 
net sales decreased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for most of our major vinyls products 
the decreased sales prices were partially offset by higher sales volumes for pvc resin and caustic 
average selling prices for the vinyls segment decreased by in as compared to income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for pvc resin and pvc pipe  and higher feedstock costs which was partially offset by higher sales volumes for pvc resin and caustic soda 
margins and demand in the first nine months of were very strong due to supply constraints resulting from the impact from hurricanes katrina and rita 
selling prices  margins and sales volumes for pvc resin and pvc pipe fell dramatically in the fourth quarter of due to weakness in the construction market  falling energy prices and seasonal slowdowns 
these margins remained under pressure during due to the continued weakness in the construction market  higher feedstock costs and the inability to raise prices for our downstream products in response to these higher costs 
compared with net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to higher selling prices for our major products and higher sales volumes for pvc resin and polyethylene which was largely offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene  vcm  and pvc pipe 
higher selling prices largely resulted from higher raw material costs that were generally passed through to customers 
pvc resin sales volumes increased primarily due to the supply of additional volumes from our geismar facility and polyethylene sales volumes increased primarily due to the acquisition of the longview facility 
sales volumes for other major products were down largely due to the slowing market for new home construction  inventory reductions in the second half of and increased internal consumption of ethylene at our geismar facility 
gross margin 
gross margin percentage decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to turnaround maintenance activity and weak demand in the fourth quarter of for many of our major products as customers generally reduced their inventories 
maintenance costs increased due to the outages at lake charles and calvert city and additional fixed costs were expensed as several of the facilities curtailed production late in the year due to declining demand 
in addition  margins decreased due to higher raw material costs 
our raw materials costs in both segments normally track industry prices  which experienced  according to cmai  an increase of for ethane and for propane in as compared to as previously discussed  we use derivative instruments in conjunction with certain physical commodity positions to reduce price volatility risk on commodities and take advantage of pricing relationships 
in  cost of sales benefited from an improved feedstock commodity trading gain of million compared to a loss of million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher professional fees  the goodrich settlement in with no comparable activity in see note to the consolidated financial statements  additional headcount as a result of the acquisition of the longview facility and higher sales commissions 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million in to million from million in average interest rates were lower in due to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes on january  and the redemption of the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in february

we recognized million in non operating expense in the first quarter of resulting from a write off in previously capitalized debt issuance cost in connection with the repayment of million of our term loan 
other income  net 
other income  net increased by million to million in from million in primarily due to higher interest income associated with higher cash balances and higher interest rates  increased equity in income from our joint venture in china  and a derivative loss reflected in income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in  and this rate is below the statutory rate of primarily due to the release of  among other things  a tax benefit related to the reversal of various tax accruals due to the resolution of certain tax matters 
this reduced the rate approximately percentage points 
in addition  adjustments were made to income taxes for deferred income taxes  tax benefits related to extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefits eti  tax benefits related to tax exempt interest and the manufacturing deduction 
these reductions in the effective tax rate were partially offset by state taxes 
the effective income tax rate of was lower than the statutory rate of due to eti approximately percentage points  tax benefits related to the new domestic manufacturing deduction and other adjustments to deferred income taxes partially offset by state taxes 
olefins segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in sales improved due to higher sales prices throughout the olefins segment  which were largely offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene 
polyethylene sales volumes increased due to the acquisition of the longview facility on november  average selling prices for the olefins segment increased by in as compared to higher selling prices were primarily the result of our ability to pass along higher raw material costs to our customers 
overall sales volumes for the olefins segment decreased primarily due to an increase in the internal requirements for ethylene at our geismar facility 
sales volumes were also impacted by inventory reductions by our customers and the housing slowdown that has occurred in the us as previously discussed 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to higher raw material costs for ethane and propane  lower overall sales volumes and higher expenses related to the unscheduled outage and maintenance turnaround at one of our lake charles ethylene units 
this decrease was partially offset by price increases throughout the olefins segment which resulted in higher profit margins for polyethylene and ethylene although profit margins for these products dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of income from operations also benefited from an improved feedstock trading gain of million compared to a loss of million in vinyls segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to overall higher selling prices for our vinyls products  especially pvc resin  and higher sales volumes of pvc resin 
average selling prices for the vinyls segment increased by in as compared to as we were able to pass along higher raw material costs to our customers 
overall  the vinyls segment sales volumes decreased by compared to as a result of declines in vcm and pvc fabricated product sales volumes 
pvc resin sales volumes increased primarily due to additional volumes from the geismar facility 
pvc pipe sales volumes were negatively impacted by the slowing rate of new home construction in the us and inventory reductions by our customers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower production volumes and higher maintenance expense related to the planned maintenance turnaround at our calvert city facility that occurred in may  higher raw material costs and a significant reduction in demand for most of our vinyls products in the fourth quarter of as previously discussed 
selling prices and sales volumes decreased significantly in the fourth quarter resulting in lower operating rates and higher unabsorbed cost 
the higher raw material costs resulted in lower margins for several of our products despite higher sales prices 
cash flows operating activities operating activities provided cash of million in compared to million in the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower income from operations in and unfavorable changes in working capital  partially offset by million of debt retirement costs incurred in with no equivalent costs in and a reduction in turnaround costs of million in as compared to changes in components of working capital  which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expense and other current assets less accounts payable and accrued liabilities  used cash of million in  compared to million of cash used in  an increase in cash use of million 
in  accounts receivable increased by million largely due to increased sales while inventory increased by million 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million during the primary reason for the million use of cash related to working capital in was due to an increase in inventory of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
operating activities provided cash of million in compared to million in the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in income from operations  debt retirement costs of million  turnaround costs of million and higher income tax payments in tax payments are higher in than because benefited from utilization of net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
changes in components of working capital used cash of million in  compared to million of cash used in this change represents a decrease in cash use of million 
in  inventory increased by million primarily due to a drop in demand late in the year

million of the proceeds of this issuance were utilized to fund capital projects in louisiana 
the balance of the proceeds  net of expenses  from this issuance is classified as restricted cash on the december  consolidated balance sheet because of the restricted permitted uses of such proceeds

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our long term financing 
as discussed previously  we are currently performing a feasibility study in connection with the potential development of an ethane based ethylene  polyethylene and other derivatives project in the republic of trinidad and tobago 
it is expected that  if the project moves forward  we would invest some level of cash and the remainder would be financed through a project financing arrangement 
we are also expanding our chlor alkali and pvc resin units  building a large diameter pvc pipe plant at our calvert city facility and starting up a pvc pipe facility in the western region of the united states 
the expected aggregate cost of these chlor alkali and pvc projects is approximately million 
we believe that our sources of liquidity as described above  along with any additional project financing  will be adequate to fund our cash requirements 
should we pursue additional expansions of existing assets or acquisition of third party assets  the availability of additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates cannot be assured due to the current volatility of the commercial credit markets

these restrictions  among other things  provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets 
these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  including  without limitation  an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share currently per share

the amount allowed under this restriction was million at december  the revolving credit facility also restricts dividend payments unless  after giving effect to such payment  the availability under the line of credit equals or exceeds million 
none of the agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios  except that the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to when availability falls below million 
in addition  the senior notes indenture and the revolving credit facility restrict our ability to create liens  to engage in certain affiliate transactions and to engage in sale leaseback transactions

our more critical accounting policies include those related to long lived assets  accruals for long term employee benefits  inventories  accounts receivable and environmental and legal obligations 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates 
we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts 
for export contracts  the title and risk of loss passes to customers at the time specified by each contract 
provisions for discounts  rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
long lived assets 
key estimates related to long lived assets include useful lives  recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations and such estimates could be significantly modified 
the carrying values of long lived assets could be impaired by new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses 
actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from three to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
we defer the costs of major turnaround maintenance and repair activities and amortize the costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
in  we had a major turnaround at our lake charles facility 
in  we had a major turnaround at our calvert city facility and at one of our ethylene units in lake charles 
total costs deferred on these turnarounds were million in and million in there were no major turnarounds in amortization in  and of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   capitalized turnaround costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
expensing turnaround costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
additional information concerning long lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

index to financial statements long term employee benefit costs 
our costs for long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is our responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties 
it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and  if necessary  adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we rely extensively on advice from actuaries  and assumptions are made about inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates 
assumed healthcare trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans because benefits for participants are capped at a fixed amount 
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
inventories 
inventories primarily include product  materials and supplies 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
the use of other methods  such as lifo  could result in differing amounts being reported as inventories and cost of sales depending on price changes and sales turnover levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  and consistent with our accounting policy  we estimate the amount of accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected and we record an expense of that amount 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strength of our customers  and  in our analysis  we combine the use of historical experience  our accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
balances over days past due and accounts determined by our analysis of financial strength of customers to be high risk are reviewed individually for collectibility 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes 
deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
environmental and legal obligations 
we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings 
we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable 
we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products 
based on our open derivative positions at december   a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before taxes by million and a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of propane would have decreased our income before taxes by million 
additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million outstanding 
all of the debt outstanding under our credit facility and tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds is at variable rates 
we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt  but we may do so in the future 
the interest rate for our variable rate debt of million as of december  was 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
also  at december   we had million of fixed rate debt 
we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced 
if interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
