item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of atlantic american corporation atlantic american or the parent and its subsidiaries collectively  the company for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
atlantic american is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted primarily through its insurance subsidiaries american southern insurance company and american safety insurance company together known as american southern and bankers fidelity life insurance company bankers fidelity 
each operating company is managed separately  offers different products and is evaluated on its individual performance 
in december  the company entered into an agreement for the sale of its regional property and casualty operations  association casualty insurance company and association risk management general agency  inc together known as association casualty and georgia casualty surety company georgia casualty to columbia mutual insurance company 
the sale is expected to be completed on or about march  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the consolidated financial statements reflect the assets  liabilities and operating results of the regional property and casualty operations as discontinued operations 
accordingly  unless otherwise noted  amounts and analyses contained herein reflect the continuing operations of the company and exclude the regional property and casualty operations 
references to income and loss from operations are identified as continuing operations or discontinued operations  while references to net income or net loss reflect the consolidated net results of both continuing and discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  in management s belief  conform to general practices within the insurance industry 
the following is an explanation of the company s accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual operating results could differ significantly from management s initial estimates determined using these policies 
atlantic american does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity  although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  this obligation includes estimates for unpaid losses on claims reported prior to december   development on those reported claims  unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported and unpaid loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to december  quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary  materially  from period to period 
estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the company 
development on reported claims  estimates of unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported  and estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses  are developed based on the company s historical experience  using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis 
the company s actuarial staff develops ranges of estimated development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods including the paid loss development method  the reported loss development method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method and the reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the company s administrative policies 
further  a variety of external factors  such as legislative changes  medical cost inflation  and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company s approach is to select an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a 
table of contents variety of reserving methods  as opposed to total reliance on any single method 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reviewed periodically for significant lines of business  and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates  the amount of the company s recorded liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is adjusted 
in the event the company s actual reported losses in any period are materially in excess of the previous estimated amounts  such losses  to the extent reinsurance coverage does not exist  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
future policy benefits comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  these liabilities relate primarily to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields  mortality rates  and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation 
the assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the company s experience 
if actual results differ from the initial assumptions  the amount of the company s recorded liability could require adjustment 
deferred acquisition costs comprised of the company s total assets at december  deferred acquisition costs are commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal business and are generally deferred and amortized 
the deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to expense in a systematic manner 
traditional life insurance and long duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves 
the deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums for traditional life and long duration health insurance and from the related unearned premiums and investment income for property and casualty and short duration health insurance 
assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year s projected losses related to the unearned premiums 
projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any given previous calendar year 
receivables are amounts due from reinsurers  insureds and agents and comprised of the company s total assets at december  insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility 
annually  the company performs an analysis of the credit worthiness of the company s reinsurers using various data sources 
failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies or disputes could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the company 
allowances for uncollectible amounts are established  as and when a loss has been determined probable  against the related receivable 
losses are recognized when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the company s historical experience 
cash and investments comprised of the company s total assets at december  substantially all investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks  which are subject to significant market fluctuations 
the company carries all investments as available for sale and  accordingly  at their estimated fair values 
the company owns certain non redeemable preferred stocks that do not have quoted values and are carried at estimated fair values as determined by management 
such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility 
on occasion  the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time 
when an investment s indicated fair value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time  primarily due to changes in credit risk  the company evaluates such investment for other than a temporary impairment 
if other than a temporary impairment is deemed to exist  then the company will write down the amortized cost basis of the investment to its estimated fair value 
while such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the company s balance sheet  it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income taxes comprised approximately of the company s total assets at december  deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes 
these 
table of contents deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies

such variations between years in realized investment gains significantly influence the reported income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
income from continuing operations before income taxes and realized investment gains was million in both and income from continuing operations before income taxes and realized investment losses in was million

in  american southern s five largest states in terms of premium revenue were florida  ohio  georgia  alabama  and indiana which accounted for of gross written premiums 
the performance of an insurance company is often measured by its combined ratio 
the combined ratio represents the percentage of losses  loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company 
a combined ratio of under represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over indicates an underwriting loss 
the combined ratio is divided into two components  the loss ratio the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and the expense ratio the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned 
the combined ratio for american southern decreased to in from a combined ratio of in the loss ratio decreased to in from in the decrease in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to the loss and cancellation of several commercial programs

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company has structured borrowings that  in accordance with us gaap  are recorded on the company s balance sheet at an amount that differs from the ultimate contractual obligation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table discloses the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands bank debt payable junior subordinated debentures interest payable operating leases purchase commitments losses and claims future policy benefits unearned premiums other policy liabilities total interest payable is based on interest rates as of december  and assumes that all debt remains outstanding until its stated contractual maturity 
represents balances due for goods and or services which have been contractually committed as of december  to the extent contracts provide for early termination with notice but without penalty  only the amounts contractually due during the notice period have been included 
losses and claims include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company  the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr reserves is an estimate  subject to significant uncertainty 
the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with any applicable claimant 
final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future 
in estimating the timing of future payments by year  the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue
