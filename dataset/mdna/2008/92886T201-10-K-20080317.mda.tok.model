customer churn our rate of customer terminations  or average monthly customer churn  increased to for the vonage annual report 
table of contents year ended december  from for the year ended december  during that period   of our customers terminated 
in the fourth quarter of  our average monthly customer churn was 
our churn rate could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with our service 
other factors  including increased competition from other providers  also influence our churn rate 
because of churn  we have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues 
we are continuing to supplement our new management team for our customer care organization  which is developing and implementing fundamental changes in process and technology that we believe will improve customer care 
in addition  we will continue to invest in workforce management  call routing systems and agent training to improve care  but these actions may not decrease customer churn in the future 
see item a risk factors a higher rate of customer terminations would negatively affect our business by reducing our revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base 
our strengths we believe we have the following strengths voip market position and brand 
we believe our strong brand recognition has enhanced our ability to sell our services through direct and retail distribution channels  allowing us to capitalize on growing market demand for broadband and voip 
attractive value proposition 
we offer our customers an attractive value proposition quality communications services with standard and enhanced features at prices considerably lower than those of traditional telephone services 
our most popular calling plan  the residential premium unlimited plan  offers residential customers unlimited calling minutes within the united states and to puerto rico and canada any time of the day  any day of the week  for per month plus applicable fees and taxes 
another key aspect of our value proposition is the portability of our service  enabling our customers to use vonage enabled devices to make and receive calls with their vonage phone numbers almost anywhere that a broadband internet connection is available 
in  we began offering new plans and services including several unlimited international calling plans to customers that subscribe to the residential premium unlimited plan and vonage visual voicemail where a voicemail message can be transcribed to text and sent to a customer s e mail address or mobile phone 
innovative  low cost technology platform 
we have invested significant resources in creating and maintaining our innovative software and network technology platform 
we believe this technology platform not only provides us with a competitive advantage over many other voip service providers but also allows us to maintain a low cost structure relative to traditional telephone and cable companies by leveraging our customers existing broadband internet connections  which eliminates our need to construct or maintain costly last mile telecommunications networks to reach our customers  using software rather than more expensive circuit switches or dedicated softswitches to route calls over our network  enabling us to remotely configure  monitor and update features without the need for a costly field service visit from a technician  enabling our customers to add or change their service features online  reducing our customer care expenses  allowing us to offer plug and play vonage enabled devices that our customers in most cases connect by themselves to access our service  making our service portable and also reducing the need for a costly field service visit from a technician  and providing for an online billing and automated payment system  which lowers costs by reducing the number of employees dedicated to billing and collection functions and eliminating the need for paper bills 
our technology platform is scaleable  meaning that we require only modest capital investments in physical plant  and  as the needs of our growing customer base increase  we can augment our capacity at a low incremental cost 
our platform also allows us to enter new markets rapidly and offer our services at attractive prices 
our development team continuously works to enhance our technology  develop new features to make our plans and services appealing to existing and potential customers and maintain a leadership position in broadband telephone services 
our strategy we believe that our strong brand identity  customer value proposition and ability to deliver quality communications services are instrumental in building our customer base 
consistent with these beliefs  we have implemented a strategy which will further enable us to deliver cost effective growth 
this strategy has three stages to fix the fundamentals of the business  
table of contents part i strengthen the core and ultimately grow from the core 
in  we made significant progress toward fixing the fundamentals by reducing our cost structure and improving the efficiency of our marketing acquisition costs 
we continue to focus our efforts on improving the customer experience and reducing churn  which increased in we have laid much of the groundwork and will continue to invest in people  process and technology to improve the user experience 
this includes investments in workforce management  customer relationship management and call routing systems  which we believe  over time  will improve customer care and reduce churn 
as we look toward strengthening the core  we will develop additional innovative features  products and services 
in  we introduced a number of new features and calling plans 
these include vonage visual voicemail  international calling plans and the v portal  a vonage branded router that we expect will assist customers with trouble shooting and ultimately have a positive impact on the user experience 
we will continue to add value by offering innovative products and features and expect this will improve retention and overall customer economics 
service offerings we offer our broadband telephone services to customers through a variety of service plans with different pricing structures 
all of our service plans include an array of both basic and enhanced features  and customers have the opportunity to purchase a number of premium features at an additional fee

the vonage v portal can connect up to two vonage lines through a high speed internet connection and includes a networking router 
it has a user friendly lcd display with caller id and call timer  call logs  language selection  and built in upstream bandwidth tester 
the vonage v portal allows customers to use the internet connection for the computer and the phones at the same time 
analog telephone adapter 
our analog telephone adapters  which convert analog audio signals into digital data packets for transmission over the internet  are plugged in between the customer s touch tone telephone and existing broadband internet connection 
integrated adapter and router 
our integrated adapters and routers simplify installation by combining a standard adapter and a broadband router in one device 
integrated adapter and wireless router 
our integrated adapters and wireless routers further simplify installation by combining a standard adapter  a broadband router and a wireless wifi access point in one device 
integrated cordless phone  adapter and router 
our cordless multi phone system offers customers further integration of customer equipment by integrating a standard cordless phone system  our adapter and a router into one device 
these cordless multi phone systems are designed to appeal to mainstream consumers 
wifi phone 
the utstarcom f wifi phone is a pocket sized  wireless internet phone that uses vonage service by connecting to wireless internet access points  also known as wifi hotspots  worldwide 
the wifi phone works at open wifi hot spots or known compatible encrypted sites 
v phone 
the vonage v phone is a usb compatible device designed for use with our service 
vonage software comes pre loaded on the v phone and updates itself on the device s megabyte flash drive without installing any software on the host laptop or pc 
the v phone comes with a standard millimeter stereo earpiece microphone and customers can make and receive calls by plugging the device into virtually any windows based laptop or pc with a high speed broadband internet connection 

table of contents part i network operations our network operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  vonage network inc  which holds our networking equipment and employs the personnel who develop and operate our technology 
how vonage calls work when our customer makes a call  our equipment and network transmit the call through the following process the call starts from the phone handset and travels to the customer s vonage enabled device  which then converts the analog audio signals into digital data packets  the digital data packets are sent through the customer s existing broadband connection over the internet to our call processing center  and the digital data packets are routed by our call processing center in one of two ways depending upon the call recipient for recipients who use vonage  the digital data packets are routed over the internet to the recipient s location and converted back to analog signals by the recipient s vonage enabled device  and for recipients who are not vonage customers  the digital data packets are routed through one of our regional data connection points  which converts the digital data packets back to analog signals and routes the call to the public switched telephone network 
if someone who does not have vonage service calls a vonage customer  the call is routed over the public switched telephone network to a gateway at one of our regional data connection points  where the analog signal is converted into digital data packets  and we route the call over the internet through our call processing center to our customer 
our scaleable network architecture and centrally managed technology platform are designed to provide customers with the familiar functions and ease of use associated with traditional telephone service while allowing us to maintain and upgrade our network without significant capital expenditure and to provide our services at a low cost 
our network is based on internally developed software  rather than the expensive circuit switches and softswitches used by other telephone service providers 
we have also developed a number of software systems  such as our web based billing system  that provide our customers with valuable features while simultaneously enabling us to manage our business more efficiently 
core network elements vonage enabled devices 
we work with a number of leading equipment manufacturers to provide our customers with a variety of equipment alternatives while ensuring that all devices have the functionality found in our standard vonage enabled adapter 
call processing centers 
our call processing centers communicate with the equipment at the vonage customer s location to authenticate and authorize access to our network 
the call processing centers are also responsible for all call signaling in our network  such as initiating phone calls  delivering inbound calls to a customer s phone  and other calling features such as call forwarding 
the call processing centers are built from our internally developed software and industry standard servers and make use of techniques in distributed computing 
regional data connection points 
calls into or out of our network  where one of the parties is not a vonage customer  are interconnected with the public switched telephone network at approximately two dozen regional data connection points in the united states  canada  mexico and the united kingdom 
our interconnections with the public switched telephone network are made pursuant to agreements we have with several telecommunications providers 
under these agreements  we transfer calls originated by our customers to other carriers who connect the call to the called party 
we pay a per minute charge for this 
the calls are transferred from our equipment to other carriers at connection points that are typically housed in small co location facilities in which we lease space from other telecommunications providers 
we generally pay monthly for this co location  based on the amount of space we use 
as we expand  we may launch additional regional data connection points to reduce our network transport and other costs 
this method of connecting to the public switched telephone network allows us to expand capacity quickly  as necessary to meet call volume  and to provide redundancy within our network 
our business is not substantially dependent upon our agreements with other carriers or our inter vonage annual report 
table of contents connection agreements  because we can easily substitute other telecommunications providers in order to obtain the same or similar service at similar cost 
other key systems network operations center 
we currently maintain a network operations center at our headquarters and redundancies at several points within our network 
the network operations center monitors and manages the status and health of our network elements  allowing us to manage our network in real time  respond to alert notifications and re route network traffic as needed 
we pursue a multi faceted approach to managing our network to ensure high call quality and reliable communications services to our customers 
back office systems 
in addition to our network management systems  we have developed a number of software systems that enable us to manage our network and service offering more efficiently and effectively 
key aspects of these systems include customer device management system 
we have developed a suite of software solutions that enable us to remotely provision  monitor and configure customer devices and services 
when we develop new service offerings or software solutions  we can securely update a customer s equipment and software features without the need for costly field visits 
web portal 
we provide a fully functional customer web portal that allows our customers to configure and manage almost all aspects of their service on the internet 
in addition  we have developed our own scaleable web based billing system that allows our customers to access all of their call usage and billing details 
reporting tools 
to enhance our network operations efforts  we have a series of internally developed monitoring and reporting tools that enable us to more effectively manage our network and quickly and efficiently recognize and respond to potential issues 
emergency calling service and enhanced service 
we have deployed e service to approximately of our us customer base that is comparable to the emergency calling services provided to customers of traditional wireline telephone companies in the same area 
for customers in areas where our e service is available  emergency calls are routed  subject to the limitations discussed below  directly to an emergency services dispatcher at the public safety answering point  or psap  in the area of the customer s registered location 
the dispatcher will have automatic access to the customer s telephone number and registered location information 
however  if a customer places an emergency call using the customer s vonage enabled device in a location different from the one registered with us  the emergency call will be routed to a psap in the customer s registered location  not the customer s actual location at the time of the call 
every time a customer moves his or her vonage enabled device to a new location  the customer s registered location information must be updated and verified 
until this occurs  the customer will have to verbally advise the emergency dispatcher of his or her actual location at the time of the call and wait for the call to be transferred  if possible  to the appropriate local emergency response center before emergency assistance can be dispatched 
in some cases  even under our new service  emergency calls may be routed to a psap in the area of the customer s registered location  but such psap may not be capable of receiving our transmission of the caller s registered location information and  in some cases  the caller s phone number 
where the emergency call center is unable to process the information  the caller is provided a service that is similar to the basic services offered to some wireline telephone customers and some wireless customers 
in these instances  the emergency caller may be required to verbally advise the operator of their location at the time of the call and  in some cases  provide a call back number so that the call can be handled or forwarded to an appropriate emergency dispatcher 
the emergency calls of customers located in areas where we currently do not provide either e or the basic described above are either routed directly to the psap in the area of the customer s location or supported by a national call center that is run by a third party provider and operates hours a day  seven days a week 
in these cases  a caller must provide the operator with his or her physical location and call back number 
if a customer reaches the call center  the operator will 
table of contents part i coordinate connecting the caller to the appropriate psap or emergency services provider 
our e service does not support the calls of our v phone  wifi phone and softphone users 
the emergency calls of our v phone  wifi phone and softphone users are supported by the national call center 
agreements with e service providers 
to enable us to effectively deploy and provide our e service  we currently maintain agreements with several e service providers 
intrado  inc maintains an extensive psap database for the purpose of deploying and operating e services 
the database includes contact  technical infrastructure  boundary and routing information for delivery of calls to psap or emergency service providers in the united states 
our agreement with intrado  inc was renewed until july  and we have the option to extend the agreement for successive one year terms thereafter 
our agreement with level communications assists us in the routing and termination of e calls 
for those customers located in an e area serviced by our agreement with level communications  emergency calls are routed directly to an emergency service dispatcher at the psap in the area of the customer s registered location 
the dispatcher will have automatic access to the customer s telephone number and registered location information 
the agreement will continue through december  and then will convert to a month to month basis unless terminated by us or by level communications upon thirty days written notice 
while our new e service being deployed in the united states is designed to route calls in a fashion similar to traditional wireline services  our new e capabilities are not yet available in all locations 
some of the emergency calls of customers located in areas where we are currently unable to provide either e or the basic services are routed to a national call center that is run by telecommunication systems  inc and operates hours a day  seven days a week 
the call center operator will coordinate connecting the caller to the appropriate psap or emergency services provider 
telecommunication systems  inc also maintains an extensive psap database for the purpose of deploying and operating e services 
the database includes contact  technical infrastructure  boundary and routing information for delivery of calls to psap or emergency service providers in the united states 
our agreement with telecommunication systems  inc will continue through june  and then will automatically renew for one year periods thereafter  unless either we or telecommunication systems  inc notifies the other party within sixty days of the expiration of the relevant period 
other agreements 
we have entered into agreements with several service providers to assist us with operations 
we support local number portability for our customers  which allow new customers to retain their existing telephone numbers when subscribing to our services 
we rely on our agreement with synchronoss technologies inc to facilitate the transfer of customer telephone numbers 
this agreement will continue through december third party verification  inc performs the third party verification of pertinent local number portability information from our subscribers 
this verification is an integral process step prior to porting a customer from one local telephone company to us 
our agreement with third party verification  inc will continue through may  and will automatically renew for one year periods thereafter  unless either we or third party verification  inc notifies the other party within sixty days of the expiration of the relevant period 
our agreement with neustar  inc provides us with certain operations support systems services that enable us to implement our local number portability solution 
pursuant to the agreement  neustar  inc enables us to exchange information with other communication service providers to facilitate the transfer of new customers telephone numbers when subscribing to our services 
this agreement will continue through december  unless either we or neustar  inc experiences any of several insolvency events defined in the agreement  or commits any event of default defined in the agreement 
security 
we have developed a service architecture and platform that use industry standard security techniques and allow us to remotely manage customer devices 
any vonage enabled device used by our customers can be securely managed by us  and these devices use authentication mechanisms to identify themselves to our service in order to place and receive calls 
we regularly update our protocols and systems to protect against unauthorized access 
vonage annual report 
table of contents technology and development we conduct substantial ongoing technology development to continually strengthen our network platform and enhance the communications services we offer to our customers 
we seek to hire talented and innovative engineers and software programmers to solve challenging problems in areas such as distributed computing and high availability systems 
for example  through our patent pending sip thru nat sm technology  we have developed the ability to provide voip phone service to a customer whose vonage enabled device is located behind a network firewall without requiring any manual configuration 
also  our subscriber growth requires us to efficiently scale our operations to meet increased call volume  while continuing to ensure call quality and service reliability 
we continue to research new hardware and software technologies that will further enable us to grow 
marketing our marketing objective is to achieve subscriber line goals by cost effectively acquiring and retaining customers 
in early  as part of a broad process to reduce our overall cost structure  we reduced our full year marketing budget by  as we implemented these reductions  we conducted a comprehensive review of all of our marketing programs and eliminated those that were not producing the desired results 
during this transition  we changed our marketing strategy to increase our focus on customer acquisition and reduced expenditures that were primarily intended for branding purposes 
furthermore  we refined our marketing message to better distinguish ourselves from cable companies and more effectively communicate our value proposition 
we employ an integrated multi channel approach to marketing 
we make use of broad reach and highly targeted media channels including television  online  direct mail  database  alternative media  print  telemarketing  partner marketing and customer referral programs 
as a national provider  we believe we are able to buy online and traditional media in a highly efficient manner 
we give our customers a choice to transact in a manner that is easy and convenient 
our customers have multiple channels and ways to purchase vonage services and products  through the internet  by phone  in a retail store or a kiosk 
they can choose various payment options  like credit cards  debit cards and electronic check payments  or ecp 
we monitor the results of our marketing efforts closely in a number of ways  including the cost of acquiring new subscriber lines  to evaluate which approaches produce the best results and deploy our marketing resources accordingly 
all of our testing follows disciplined direct marketing tactics which helps us isolate the variables that are driving performance 
and  because we track performance beyond the gross sale  we are able to prioritize those programs that bring in high value  long term customers 
we believe the scale of our advertising program has given us greater purchasing power than many of our competitors and has enabled us to negotiate favorable pricing arrangements 
unlike our regional competitors  we are able to leverage national advertising campaigns 
we are opportunistic in our purchase of available advertising slots and keep part of our budget in reserve to take advantage of last minute opportunities 
this approach often provides significant cost savings  enabling us to reach a greater number of potential customers more cost efficiently 
we make use of marketing research to gain consumer insights into brand  product and service performance 
we also monitor brand strength among voip  broadband and dial up customers 
market research is also leveraged in the areas of testing  retention marketing and product marketing 
we believe gaining insights into customer needs  wants and preferences is a key marketing asset 
we augment these marketing efforts with refer a friend  our online customer referral program 
under this program  existing customers can use the vonage website to send e mails to their friends that describe our service offerings and track their responses 
we also introduced a referral feature that allows referrers to use their vonage telephone number as a type of coupon code to allow greater word of mouth exposure 
in return for referring a new customer  both the new and the existing customer receive a service credit 
sales and distribution direct sales the primary sales channel for our service historically has been through in bound telemarketing and online direct sales 
customers can subscribe to our services at our websites  http www

uk  or through our toll free number 
we complement this sales channel with other marketing channels including television  direct mail  database  alternative media  print  telemarketing  partner marketing  customer referral programs and outbound telephone direct sales 

table of contents part i retail sales in addition to our direct sales channel  we also offer sales through our retail channel 
our service currently is available at the outlets of leading national and regional retailers  including best buy  circuit city and wal mart 
we believe that the availability of our devices through premier retailers enhances and reinforces the vonage brand with consumers and that the retail channel increases our ability to acquire mainstream consumers by reaching them in a familiar and interactive shopping environment 
in addition  we opened fifty vonage kiosks throughout the united states in and customer relations customer service we offer our customers support hours a day  seven days a week through both our comprehensive online account management website and our toll free number 
we believe that many customers use our online account management website first when they have a question or problem with their service and that many of them are able to resolve their concerns online without needing to speak to a customer care representative 
our customers can manage almost all aspects of their accounts online 
this capability both empowers our customers through self service and reduces our customer care expenses 
customers who cannot or do not wish to resolve their questions through our website can contact a live customer care representative through our toll free number 
we staff our customer care hotline through a combination of our own employees and outsourced customer care representatives 
all new customer care representatives are trained through an established program developed by vonage 
we also have a separate team called advanced technical support for resolving customers complex issues that could not be handled by our other tiers 
we use extensive monitoring of call quality and customer satisfaction scores to determine additional training or coaching requirements for individual employees 
our strategy includes an effort to improve the customer experience  which we believe will assist in reducing churn  which increased in we are continuing to supplement our management team for our customer care organization  which is developing and implementing fundamental changes in process  technology and training that we believe will improve the customer experience 
billing all customer billing is automated through our website  and notifications of credit and debit card charges and ecp are distributed by e mail 
we automatically collect all fees from our customers credit card  debit card and ecp 
by collecting monthly subscription fees in advance and certain other charges immediately after they are incurred  we are able to reduce the amount of accounts receivable that we have outstanding  thus allowing us to have lower working capital requirements 
collecting in this manner also helps us mitigate bad debt exposure  which is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
if a customer s credit card  debit card or ecp is declined  we generally suspend international calling capabilities as well as the customer s ability to incur domestic usage charges in excess of the customer s plan minutes 
historically  in most cases  we are able to correct the problem with the customer within the current monthly billing cycle 
if the customer s credit card  debit card or ecp cannot be successfully processed during three billing cycles ie the current and two subsequent monthly billing cycles  we terminate the account 
intellectual property we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the experience  technical competence and the creative ability of our engineering and technology staff 
we review our technological developments with our technology staff and business units to identify the features of our core technology that provide us with a technological or commercial advantage and file patent applications as necessary to protect these features in the united states and internationally 
our company policies require our employees to assign their intellectual property rights to us and to treat all technology as our confidential information 
we have filed several patent applications to protect our technology  which are all currently pending 
in addition to developing technology  we evaluate the licensing and acquisition of intellectual property of others in order to identify technology that provides us with a technological or commercial advantage 
in  we acquired three patents from digital packet licensing inc that enable voip technology 
the patents are related to the compression of packetized digital signals commonly used in voip technology 
one of the patents has expired  and the other patents expire in and  respectively

see item legal proceedings patent litigation 
we are the owner of numerous trademarks and service marks and have applied for registration of our trademarks and service marks in the united states and abroad to establish and protect our brand names as part of our intellectual property strategy 
some of our registered marks include vonage  redefining communications  vonage digital voice and vonage the broadband phone company 
these registered marks have a duration of five years from the date they are registered 
we endeavor to protect our internally developed systems and maintain our trademarks and service marks 
typically  we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  customers and vendors in an effort to control access to and distribution of our technology  software  documentation and other information 
competition we face strong competition from incumbent telephone companies  cable companies  alternative voice communication providers and wireless companies 
because most of our target customers are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers  our success is dependent upon our ability to attract these customers away from their existing providers 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our ability to attract and retain customers are price  call quality  reliability  customer service and enhanced services and features 
incumbent telephone companies the incumbent telephone companies are our primary competitors and have historically dominated their regional markets 
these competitors include at t  qwest communications and verizon communications as well as rural incumbents  such as citizens communications 
these competitors are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base 
many of their customers either do not have a broadband internet connection or are very satisfied with their current service 
in addition  many users of traditional phone service who might otherwise switch to our service do not have the ability to cancel their traditional phone service without also losing their broadband dsl service 
while a majority of broadband users today subscribe to cable modem service  recent trends suggest that dsl providers are gaining broadband market share 
others are not willing to install a vonage enabled device  accept the limitations of our emergency calling service  forgo service during power outages or trust a new company such as vonage with a vital service 
before subscribing to our service  a substantial majority of our new customers must first decide to terminate their service from their incumbent telephone company or pay for our service in addition to their existing service 
the incumbent phone companies own networks that include a last mile connection to substantially all of our existing and potential customers as well as the places our customers call 
as a result  the vast majority of the calls placed by a vonage customer are carried over the last mile by an incumbent phone company  and we indirectly pay access charges to these competitors for each of these calls 
in contrast  traditional wireline providers do not pay us when their customers call our customers 
their last mile connections enable these competitors to bundle phone service with internet access and television at prices we may find difficult to compete with 
we currently charge prices that are significantly lower than prices charged by the incumbent phone companies  which has facilitated our growth 
we believe the incumbent phone companies have significant overhead expenses  which have resulted in the high prices they charge 
however  their marginal cost to complete each additional call on their networks is negligible 
this could lead them to decrease the prices they charge  which would have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain their customers 
we also currently compete successfully with the incumbent phone companies on the basis of the features we offer that they do not such as area code selection and virtual phone numbers and features we offer at no extra charge 
the incumbent phone companies might be able to improve their offerings in these areas  which would also have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers 
furthermore  the incumbent phone companies could offer broadband communications through subsidiaries that are not burdened with their overhead and legacy equipment 
given their ability to offer dsl last mile connections  this would significantly enhance their ability to compete with us on the basis of price and features 
the incumbent phone companies have long standing relationships with regulators  legislators  lobbyists and the media 
this can be an advantage for them because legislative  regulatory or judicial developments in our rapidly evolving industry could have a negative impact on us 

table of contents part i cable companies these competitors include companies such as cablevision  comcast corporation  cox communications and time warner cable 
cable companies have made and are continuing to make substantial investments in delivering broadband internet access to their customers 
as a result  they can be expected to compete intensely for the money that their customers spend for phone service over that connection 
they provide internet access and cable television to most of our existing and potential customers 
this allows them to engage in highly targeted  low cost direct marketing and may enhance their image as trusted providers of services 
cable companies are aggressively using their existing customer relationships to bundle services 
for example  they bundle internet access  cable television and phone service with an implied price for the phone service that may be significantly below ours 
they are able to advertise on their local access channels with no significant out of pocket cost and through mailings in bills with little marginal cost 
they also receive advertising time as part of their relationships with television networks  and they are able to use this time to promote their telephone service offerings 
we believe our ability to successfully compete with cable companies is enhanced by the features we offer that cable companies do not offer such as portable service and wide choice of area codes and because our national presence makes us more attractive to national retail outlets and allows us to more efficiently purchase national advertising 
wireless telephone companies we also compete with wireless phone companies  such as at t formerly cingular wireless llc  sprint nextel  t mobile and verizon wireless 
some consumers use wireless phones  instead of voip phones  as a replacement for a wireline phone 
also  wireless phone companies increasingly are providing wireless broadband internet access to their customers and may in the future offer voip to their customers 
some of these companies have developed or are developing a dual mode phone that will be able to use voip where broadband access is available and cellular phone service elsewhere 
wireless telephone companies have a strong retail presence and have significant financial resources 
alternative voice communication providers many alternative voice communication providers are smaller companies with limited resources that seek to offer a primary line replacement service 
these providers have not achieved customer penetration or market traction comparable to ours 
in addition to these competitors  we also compete with companies that offer computer based voip services 
these computer based voip services typically are not marketed as a primary line replacement  but because they offer their users the ability to call and be called from any phone using a dedicated phone number  they may be used to replace traditional phone service 
some of these service providers may choose to sacrifice revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at lower prices or for free 
we believe that skype a service of ebay  in particular  has a large group of users  many of whom may potentially use skype as their only phone service 
with skype  however  the ability to make and receive calls over the public switched telephone network is a feature that costs extra and which only a fraction of skype users purchase  as compared to skype s free service that has a larger market penetration 
we may also increasingly face competition from large  well capitalized internet companies  such as google  microsoft and yahoo  which have launched or plan to launch voip enabled instant messaging services 
while not all of these competitors currently offer the ability to call or be called by anyone not using their service  in the future they may integrate such capabilities into their service offerings 
in addition  a continuing trend toward consolidation of telecommunications companies and the formation of strategic alliances within the telecommunications industry  as well as the development of new technologies  could give rise to significant new competition

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks below  as well as all of the other information contained in this annual report on form k and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  in evaluating our company and our business 
any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 
our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for the future repurchase of our convertible notes 
on december   the holders of our convertible notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of our outstanding notes at a price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
as of december   we had convertible notes outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of  we and our financial advisor have engaged in preliminary discussion with certain holders of our convertible notes 
in those discussions  we have explored the possibility of a transaction in which holders would agree to forego the right to put the convertible notes in december as an inducement for holders to participate in such a transaction  we may agree to make certain modifications to the terms of the convertible notes adverse to us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources if we are unable to refinance or restructure our notes or obtain additional debt or equity capital  on favorable terms  or at all  we may face substantial liquidity challenges and we may be forced to reduce or delay capital or other material expenditures  including significantly reducing our marketing expenditures or disposing of material assets to meet our potential repurchase and other obligations 
however  in light of the uncertainties in the credit markets  these alternatives may not be capable of being accomplished on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
although we are currently evaluating our options with respect to our convertible notes  the inability to repurchase  refinance or restructure our convertible notes could lead to our bankruptcy  reorganization  insolvency or liquidation 
because there can be no assurance that we will be successful in refinancing or restructuring the convertible notes or obtaining additional debt or equity capital  there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph highlighting this uncertainty in its report dated march  our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to successfully repurchase  refinance or restructure our convertible notes 
we may require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy  but we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
we intend to continue spending substantial amounts on marketing and product development in order to grow our business 
although we believe we will achieve profitability in the future  we may need to obtain additional financing to respond to new competitive pressures or to respond to opportunities to develop or acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
our significant losses to date may prevent us from obtaining additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of 
table of contents part i  which includes  in royalty  interest and litigation settlement costs related to the verizon  at t  sprint and other patent settlement agreements 
because of these losses and our limited tangible assets  we do not fit traditional credit lending criteria  which  in particular  could make it difficult for us to obtain loans or to access the capital markets 
in addition  the terms of our outstanding convertible notes provide for additional shares to be issued upon conversion if we sell shares of our common stock at a price that is less than the average trading price of our common stock over the day period prior to any such sale  which might further limit our access to the capital markets 
we have incurred quarterly losses since our inception  and we may continue to incur losses in the future 
we have incurred losses since our inception  and we may continue to incur losses in the future 
for the period from our inception through december   our accumulated deficit was  our quarterly net losses generally increased each quarter from our inception through the quarter ended december  in and  our quarterly net losses decreased each quarter with exceptions for the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of  which included costs for patent litigation settlements 
for the quarter ended december   our net loss was  initially  our net losses were driven principally by start up costs and the costs of developing our technology 
more recently  our net losses have been driven principally by marketing expense  which was  for the year ended december  and ip litigation settlements of  for the year ended december  in order to grow our revenue and customer base  we have chosen to spend a significant amount on marketing expenditures 
in addition  we plan to continue to invest in research and development and customer care 
we are pursuing a balance of growth and profitability in the near term to capitalize on the current expansion of the broadband and voip markets and enhance our future value 
although we believe we will achieve profitability in the future  we ultimately may not be successful and we may never achieve profitability 
in the past  we projected that we would generate net income during future periods  but then generated a net loss 
we intend to continue to spend a significant amount on marketing expenditures  and we may continue to generate net losses for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we will always be required to incur some marketing expense in order to replace customers who terminate our service  or churn 
further  marketing expense is not the only factor that may cause us to incur net losses 
for example  interest expense on our convertible notes of at least  annually may cause us to incur net losses unless the convertible notes are converted or repaid prior to the maturity date 
this amount will increase if we pay interest in kind on these notes 
as a result  even if we significantly reduce our marketing expense  we may continue to incur net losses 
a higher rate of customer terminations would negatively affect our business by reducing our revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base 
our rate of customer terminations  or average monthly customer churn  was for the year ended december  during that period   of our customers terminated 
in the fourth quarter of  our average monthly customer churn was 
our churn rate could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with our service 
other factors  including increased competition from other providers  also influence our churn rate 
because of churn  we have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues 
as a result  marketing expense is an ongoing requirement of our business 
if our churn rate increases  we will have to acquire even more new customers in order to maintain our existing revenues 
we incur significant costs to acquire new customers  and those costs are an important factor in determining our net losses and achieving future profitability 
therefore  if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers beyond those budgeted  our revenue could decrease and our net losses could increase 
vonage annual report 
table of contents we may not be able to maintain adequate customer care during periods of growth or in connection with our addition of new and complex vonage enabled devices  which could adversely affect our ability to grow and cause our financial results to be negatively affected 
good customer care is important to acquiring and retaining customers 
in the recent past  we have not been able to expand our customer care operations quickly enough to meet the needs of our increased customer base  and the quality of our customer care has suffered 
for example  our customers may experience longer than acceptable hold times when they call us for assistance 
in  our average monthly customer churn rate increased to from in in the fourth quarter of  our average monthly customer churn was 
we believe this increase was due in part to our inability to hire enough qualified customer care employees  which led to less than satisfactory customer care during these quarters 
in the future  as we broaden our vonage enabled device offerings and our customers build increasingly complex home networking environments  we will face additional challenges in training our customer care staff 
historically  we have faced a high turnover rate among our customer care employees 
we continue to hire and train customer care representatives at a rapid rate in order to meet the needs of our growing customer base 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain sufficient personnel to provide adequate customer care  we may experience slower growth  increased costs and higher churn levels  which would cause our financial results to be negatively impacted 
our ability to provide our service is dependent upon third party facilities and equipment  the failure of which could cause delays or interruptions of our service  damage our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our growth 
our success depends on our ability to provide quality and reliable service  which is in part dependent upon the proper functioning of facilities and equipment owned and operated by third parties and is  therefore  beyond our control 
unlike traditional wireline telephone service or wireless service  our service requires our customers to have an operative broadband internet connection and an electrical power supply  which are provided by the customer s internet service provider and electric utility company  respectively  and not by us 
the quality of some broadband internet connections may be too poor for customers to use our services properly 
in addition  if there is any interruption to a customer s broadband internet service or electrical power supply  that customer will be unable to make or receive calls  including emergency calls  using our service 
we also outsource several of our network functions to third party providers 
for example  we outsource the maintenance of our regional data connection points  which are the facilities at which our network interconnects with the public switched telephone network 
if our third party service providers fail to maintain these facilities properly  or fail to respond quickly to problems  our customers may experience service interruptions 
our customers have experienced such interruptions in the past and will experience interruptions in the future 
in addition  our new e service is currently dependent upon several third party providers 
cable companies ownership of internet connections to our customers could enable them to detect and interfere with the completion of our customers calls 
these companies may degrade the quality of  give low priority to or block entirely the information packets and other data we transmit over their lines 
in addition  these companies may attempt to charge their customers more for using our services 
this could also apply to phone companies that connect our customers to the internet 
interruptions in service from these vendors could cause failures in our customers access to e services 
interruptions in our service caused by third party facilities have in the past caused and may in the future cause us to lose customers  or cause us to offer substantial customer credits  which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
if interruptions adversely affect the perceived reliability of our service  we may have difficulty attracting new customers and our brand  reputation and growth will be negatively impacted 
we rely on third parties to provide a portion of our customer service representatives  initiate local number portability for our customers and provide aspects of our e service 
if these third parties do not provide our customers with reliable  high quality service  our reputation will be harmed and we may lose customers 
we offer our customers support hours a day  seven days a week through both our comprehensive online account management website and our toll free number 
we rely on multiple third parties outside of the us to provide a portion of the customer service representatives that respond to customer inquiries 
these third party providers generally represent us without identifying themselves as independent parties 
we also maintain agreements with several e providers and companies that initiate our local number portability  which allow new customers to retain their 
table of contents part i existing telephone numbers when subscribing to our services 
if these parties do not provide reliable  high quality service  our reputation and our business will be harmed 
in addition  industry consolidation among providers of services to us may impact our ability to obtain these services or increase our expense for these services 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we could lose market share and revenue 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
we face intense competition from traditional telephone companies  wireless companies  cable companies and alternative voice communication providers 
our principal competitors are the traditional telephone service providers  including at t  qwest communications and verizon communications  and rural incumbents such as citizens communications  which provide telephone service based on the public switched telephone network 
some of these traditional providers also have added or are planning to add voip services to their existing telephone and broadband offerings 
we also face  or expect to face  competition from cable companies  such as cablevision  comcast corporation  cox communications  and time warner cable a division of time warner inc  which have added or are planning to add voip services to their existing cable television  voice and broadband offerings 
further  wireless providers  including at t  sprint nextel  t mobile and verizon wireless  offer services that some customers may prefer over wireline service 
in the future  as wireless companies offer more minutes at lower prices  their services may become more attractive to customers as a replacement for wireline service 
some of these providers may be developing a dual mode phone that will be able to use voip where broadband access is available and cellular phone service elsewhere  which will pose additional competition to our offerings 
most traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base 
because most of our target customers are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers  our success is dependent upon our ability to attract target customers  who are mainstream consumers  away from their existing providers 
in addition  these competitors could focus their substantial financial resources to develop competing technology that may be more attractive to potential customers than what we offer 
our competitors financial resources may allow them to offer services at prices below cost or even for free in order to maintain and gain market share or otherwise improve their competitive positions 
our competitors also could use their greater financial resources to offer voip services with more attractive service packages that include on site installation and more robust customer service 
in addition  because of the other services our competitors provide  they may choose to offer voip services as part of a bundle that includes other products  such as video  high speed internet access and wireless telephone service  which we do not offer 
this bundle may enable our competitors to offer voip service at prices with which we may not be able to compete or to offer functionality that integrates voip service with their other offerings  both of which may be more desirable to consumers 
any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers  cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenues 
we also compete against established alternative voice communication providers  such as skype a service of ebay inc  and face competition from other large  well capitalized internet companies  such as google inc  microsoft corporation and yahoo inc  which have recently launched or plan to launch voip enabled instant messaging services 
in addition  we compete with independent voip service providers 
some of these service providers may choose to sacrifice revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at lower prices or for free 
in order to compete with such service providers  we may have to significantly reduce our prices  which would delay or prevent our profitability 
decreasing telecommunications prices may cause us to lower our prices to remain competitive  which could delay or prevent our future profitability 
currently  our prices are lower than those of many of our competitors for comparable services 
however  domestic and international telecommunications prices have decreased significantly over the last few years  and we anticipate that prices will continue to decrease 
users who select our service offerings to take advantage of our prices may switch to another service provider as the vonage annual report 
table of contents difference between prices diminishes or disappears  and we may be unable to use our price as a distinguishing feature to attract new customers in the future 
such competition or continued price decreases may require us to lower our prices to remain competitive  may result in reduced revenue  a loss of customers or a decrease in our subscriber line growth and may delay or prevent our future profitability 
if voip technology fails to gain acceptance among mainstream consumers  our ability to grow our business will be limited 
the market for voip service is continuing to rapidly evolve 
we currently generate most of our revenue from the sale of voip services and related products to residential customers 
revenue generated from sales to residential customers will continue to account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we believe that a significant portion of our initial residential customers are early adopters of voip technology 
however  in order for our business to continue to grow and to become profitable  voip technology must gain acceptance among mainstream consumers  who tend to be less technically knowledgeable and more resistant to new technology services 
because potential voip customers need to connect additional hardware not required for the use of traditional telephone service  mainstream consumers may be reluctant to use our service 
we have shifted our focus of advertising to reach out to the mainstream consumer and increase brand awareness  primarily with new television commercials 
however  if mainstream consumers choose not to adopt our technology  our ability to grow our business will be limited 
certain aspects of our service are not the same as traditional telephone service  which may limit the acceptance of our services by mainstream consumers and our potential for growth 
certain aspects of our service are not the same as traditional telephone service 
our continued growth is dependent on the adoption of our services by mainstream customers  so these differences are becoming increasingly important 
for example both our new e and emergency calling services are different  in significant respects  from the service associated with traditional wireline and wireless telephone providers and  in certain cases  with other voip providers 
our customers may experience lower call quality than they are used to from traditional wireline telephone companies  including static  echoes and delays in transmissions 
our customers may experience higher dropped call rates than they are used to from traditional wireline telephone companies 
customers who obtain new phone numbers from us do not appear in the phone book and their phone numbers are not available through directory assistance services offered by traditional telephone companies 
our customers cannot accept collect calls 
in the event of a power loss or internet access interruption experienced by a customer  our service is interrupted 
unlike some of our competitors  we have not installed batteries at customer premises to provide emergency power for our customers equipment if they lose power  although we do have backup power systems for our network equipment and service platform 
if customers do not accept the differences between our service and traditional telephone service  they may choose to remain with their current telephone service provider or may choose to return to service provided by traditional telephone companies 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which was remediated as of december  and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
our management  after discussions with our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm  bdo seidman llp  determined that it was necessary to restate our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended june  and september  in order to correct the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded by us for those periods 
in light of the restatement  we believe that a material weakness existed in the design of our 
table of contents part i internal control procedures relating to recording stock based compensation expense  which was remediated as of december  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to conclude in the future that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud 
as a result  our failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm the market value of our common stock 
any failure to maintain effective internal controls also could impair our ability to manage our business and harm our financial results 
our emergency and new e calling services are different from those offered by traditional wireline telephone companies and may expose us to significant liability 
both our emergency calling service and our new e calling service are different  in significant respects  from the emergency calling services offered by traditional wireline telephone companies 
in each case  those differences may cause significant delays  or even failures  in callers receipt of the emergency assistance they need 
traditional wireline telephone companies route emergency calls over a dedicated infrastructure directly to an emergency services dispatcher at the psap in the caller s area 
generally  the dispatcher automatically receives the caller s phone number and actual location information 
while our new e service being deployed in the united states is designed to route calls in a fashion similar to traditional wireline services  our new e capabilities are not yet available in all locations 
in addition  the only location information that our e service can transmit to a dispatcher at a psap is the information that our customers have registered with us 
a customer s registered location may be different from the customer s actual location at the time of the call because customers can use their vonage enabled devices to make calls almost anywhere a broadband connection is available 
we are currently deploying e service that is comparable to the emergency calling services provided to customers of traditional wireline telephone companies in the same area 
for those customers located in an e area  emergency calls are routed  subject to the limitations discussed below  directly to an emergency services dispatcher at the psap in the area of the customer s registered location 
the dispatcher will have automatic access to the customer s telephone number and registered location information 
however  if a customer places an emergency call using the customer s vonage enabled device in a location different from the one registered with us  the emergency call will be routed to a psap in the customer s registered location  not the customer s actual location at the time of the call 
every time a customer moves his or her vonage enabled device to a new location  the customer s registered location information must be updated and verified 
until that takes place  the customer will have to verbally advise the emergency dispatcher of his or her actual location at the time of the call and wait for the call to be transferred  if possible  to the appropriate local emergency response center before emergency assistance can be dispatched 
in some cases  even under our new service  emergency calls may be routed to a psap in the area of the customer s registered location  but such psap may not be capable of receiving our transmission of the caller s registered location information and  in some cases  the caller s phone number 
where the emergency call center is unable to process the information  the caller is provided a service that is similar to the basic services offered to some wireline telephone customers 
in these instances  the emergency caller may be required to verbally advise the operator of their location at the time of the call and  in some cases  a call back number so that the call can be handled or forwarded to an appropriate emergency dispatcher 
the emergency calls of customers located in areas where we are currently unable to provide either e or the basic described above are supported by a national call center that is run by a third party provider and operates hours a day  seven days a week 
in these cases  a caller must provide the operator with his or her physical location and call back number 
the operator will then coordinate connecting the caller to the appropriate psap or emergency services provider 
our e service does not support the calls of our wifi phone  softphone users and v phone 
the emergency calls of our wifi phone  softphone users and v phone are supported by the national call center 
if one of our customers experiences a broadband or power outage  or if a network failure were vonage annual report 
table of contents to occur  the customer will not be able to reach an emergency services provider 
delays our customers encounter when making emergency services calls and any inability of the answering point to automatically recognize the caller s location or telephone number can have devastating consequences 
customers have attempted  and may in the future attempt  to hold us responsible for any loss  damage  personal injury or death suffered as a result 
some traditional phone companies also may be unable to provide the precise location or the caller s telephone number when their customers place emergency calls 
however  traditional phone companies are covered by legislation exempting them from liability for failures of emergency calling services and we are not 
this liability could be significant 
in addition  we have lost  and may in the future lose  existing and prospective customers because of the limitations inherent in our emergency calling services 
any of these factors could cause us to lose revenues  incur greater expenses or cause our reputation or financial results to suffer 
if we fail to comply with fcc regulations requiring us to provide e emergency calling services  we may be subject to fines or penalties  which could include disconnection of our service for certain customers or prohibitions on marketing of our services and accepting new customers in certain areas 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  released an order on june  requiring us to notify our customers of any differences between our emergency calling services and those available through traditional telephone providers and obtain affirmative acknowledgments from our customers of those notifications 
the rules also required us to offer by november  enhanced emergency calling services  or e  to all of our customers located in areas where e service is available from their traditional wireline telephone company 
e service allows emergency calls from our customers to be routed directly to an emergency dispatcher in a customer s registered location and gives the dispatcher automatic access to the customer s telephone number and registered location information 
we have notified our customers of the differences between our emergency calling services and those available through traditional telephony providers and have received affirmative acknowledgement from substantially all of our customers 
we also took steps to comply with the fcc s order by the november  deadline  but we are not currently in full compliance and do not expect to be in full compliance in the short term unless we are granted a waiver of the requirements by the fcc 
as of december   we were not providing e service to approximately of our us subscriber lines 
the consequences of failure to comply fully with the fcc s order currently are unclear 
on november   the fcc s enforcement bureau issued a public notice stating that it would not require disconnection of existing customers to whom e service cannot be provided by november   but it also stated that it expected voip providers to stop marketing and accepting new subscribers in areas where they cannot provide e service after november  it is not clear whether the fcc will enforce this restriction or how it would do so 
on november   we filed a petition for extension of time and limited waiver of certain of the enhanced emergency service requirements  including the limitations on marketing and accepting new customers 
we are continuing to market our services and accept new customers in areas in which we do not provide e service 
the fcc has not acted on our petition  and we cannot predict whether the fcc will grant our petition or provide other relief 
should we be unable to obtain an extension of time to implement the requirements of the order  we may be subject to enforcement action by the fcc that could include monetary forfeitures  cease and desist orders and other penalties 
we also may be required to stop serving customers to whom we cannot provide the e service required by the fcc s rules and to stop marketing our services and accepting new customers in areas in which we cannot provide the e service 
any of these actions could significantly harm our business 
taxes and related fees will increase our customers cost of using our services and could result in penalties being imposed on us 
until  we did not collect or remit state or municipal taxes  such as sales  excise  and ad valorem taxes  fees or surcharges on the charges to our customers for our services  except that we have historically complied with the collection of new jersey state sales tax 
we have received inquiries or demands from a number of state and municipal taxing agencies seeking payment of taxes  fees or surcharges that are applied to or collected from customers of providers of traditional public switched telephone network services 
although we have consistently maintained that these taxes  fees or surcharges do not apply to our service for a variety of reasons depending on the statute or rule 
table of contents part i that establishes such obligations  a number of states have changed their statutes as part of streamlined sales tax initiatives and we are now collecting and remitting sales taxes in those states 
the collection of these taxes  fees or surcharges will have the effect of decreasing any price advantage we may have 
in addition  a few states have enacted statutes or administrative rules that address how voip providers should contribute to support public safety agencies  and in those states we began to remit fees to the appropriate state agencies 
we have also contacted authorities in each of the other states to discuss how we can financially contribute to the system 
state and local governments may also assess fees to pay for emergency services in a customer s community 
as of december   we are collecting and remitting related fees to the appropriate authorities in twenty six states 
for most of our customers  this fee is between to per month  and as high as for a limited number of customers  depending on their location 
we also began charging customers an emergency cost recovery fee of per month  effective march  this fee is designed to cover some of our costs associated with complying with e regulation and operating our national emergency call center 
the collection of these fees will also have the effect of decreasing any price advantage we may have 
we have established a us tax reserve of  as of december  to account for the claims by some states that we should have collected and remitted sales taxes and fees in the past 
if our ultimate liability exceeds that amount  it could result in significant charges to our earnings 
in addition  in june the fcc in its order concluded that voip providers must begin contributing to the federal universal service fund  or usf  based on a safe harbor of 
in october  we began recouping our contributions through a customer surcharge  which was per line in the fourth quarter of vonage has filed an appeal of the fcc s usf order in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
on june   the district of columbia court of appeals vacated the portion of the fcc s usf order which required interconnected voip providers to make double usf payments in violation of the carrier s carrier rule 
however  the court failed to decide how interconnected voip providers would recover the usf payments made to underlying carriers 
vonage continues to pursue actions to recover all methods of payments that were made from the fcc s violation of double payments and the carrier s carrier rule 
flaws in our technology and systems could cause delays or interruptions of service  damage our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our growth 
although we have designed our service network to reduce the possibility of disruptions or other outages  our service may be disrupted by problems with our technology and systems  such as malfunctions in our software or other facilities and overloading of our network 
our customers have experienced interruptions in the past and may experience interruptions in the future as a result of these types of problems 
interruptions have in the past and may in the future cause us to lose customers and offer substantial customer credits  which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
during  we had multiple outages that affected groups of customers at various times  some of which affected large groups of customers for several hours 
in addition  because our systems and our customers ability to use our services are internet dependent  our services may be subject to hacker attacks from the internet  which could have a significant impact on our systems and services 
if service interruptions adversely affect the perceived reliability of our service  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining customers and our brand reputation and growth may suffer 
future disruptive new technologies could have a negative effect on our businesses 
voip technology  which our business is based upon  did not exist and was not commercially viable until relatively recently 
voip technology is having a disruptive effect on traditional telephone companies  whose businesses are based on other technologies 
we also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies 
if new technologies develop that are able to deliver competing voice services at lower prices  better or more conveniently  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
vonage annual report 
table of contents the success of our business relies on customers continued and unimpeded access to broadband service 
providers of broadband services may be able to block our services or charge their customers more for also using our services  which could adversely affect our revenue and growth 
our customers must have broadband access to the internet in order to use our service 
some providers of broadband access may take measures that affect their customers ability to use our service  such as degrading the quality of the data packets we transmit over their lines  giving those packets low priority  giving other packets higher priority than ours  blocking our packets entirely or attempting to charge their customers more for also using our services 
it is not clear whether suppliers of broadband internet access have a legal obligation to allow their customers to access and use our service without interference 
as a result of recent decisions by the us supreme court and the fcc  providers of broadband services are subject to relatively light regulation by the fcc 
consequently  federal and state regulators might not prohibit broadband providers from limiting their customers access to voip or otherwise discriminating against voip providers 
interference with our service or higher charges for also using our service could cause us to lose existing customers  impair our ability to attract new customers and harm our revenue and growth 
these problems could also arise in international markets 
for example  in a canadian cable provider began offering an optional cdn per month quality of service premium to customers who use third party voip services over its facilities 
however  customers who purchase voip services directly from this cable provider are not required to pay this additional fee 
our service requires an operative broadband connection  and if the adoption of broadband does not progress as expected  the market for our services will not grow and we may not be able to grow our business and increase our revenue 
use of our service requires that the user be a subscriber to an existing broadband internet service  most typically provided through a cable or digital subscriber line  or dsl  connection 
although the number of broadband subscribers worldwide has grown significantly over the last five years  this service has not yet been adopted by a majority of consumers 
if the adoption of broadband services does not continue to grow  the market for our services may not grow 
as a result  we may not be able to increase our revenue and become profitable 
we are and in the future may be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation that could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition  as well as the continued viability of our company 
we were named as a defendant in several suits that relate to patent infringement and recently entered into agreements to settle certain of the suits 
see item legal proceedings patent litigation 
in addition  we have been subject to other infringement claims in the past and  given the rapid technological change in our industry and our continual development of new products and services  we may be subject to infringement claims in the future 
we may be unaware of filed patent applications and issued patents that could include claims covering our products and services 
intellectual property litigation if determined against us could result in the loss of a substantial number of existing customers or prohibit the acquisition of new customers  lead to an event of default under the terms of our convertible notes  which could accelerate the payment of approximately  of principal and interest under our notes  cause us to accelerate expenditures to preserve exiting revenues  cause existing or new vendors to require prepayments or letters of credit  cause our credit card processors to demand additional reserves or letters of credit or make holdbacks  result in substantial employee layoffs  materially and adversely affect our brand in the market place and cause a substantial loss of goodwill  cause our stock price to decline significantly or otherwise cause us to fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the new york stock exchange  which could result in the delisting of our common stock from the exchange  materially and adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay debts and other obligations as they become due  and lead to our bankruptcy or liquidation 
parties making claims of infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our services and could cause us to pay substantial royalties  licensing fees or damages 
the defense of any lawsuit could result in time consuming and expensive litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims 

table of contents part i because much of our potential success and value lies in our use of internally developed systems and software  if we fail to protect them  it could negatively affect us 
our ability to compete effectively is dependent in large part upon the maintenance and protection of systems and software that we have developed internally based on open standards 
while we have several pending patent applications  acquired three patents from digital packet licensing  inc and settled the patent litigations with verizon  sprint  at t and others that enable voip technology  we cannot patent much of the technology that is important to our business 
to date  we have relied on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our rights to this technology 
we typically enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  customers and vendors in an effort to control access to and distribution of technology  software  documentation and other information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use this technology without authorization 
policing unauthorized use of this technology is difficult 
the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the technology we rely on 
in addition  effective protection may be unavailable or limited in some jurisdictions outside the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others 
that litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources away from our daily business  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business 
we are currently subject to securities class action litigations  the unfavorable outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a number of putative class action lawsuits have been filed against us  certain of our officers and directors  and the lead underwriters of our initial public offering  alleging  among other things  securities laws violations 
on january   the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred all complaints to the district of new jersey 
on november   the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint  which generally alleges i we made misstatements regarding subscriber line growth and average monthly churn rate  ii we failed to disclose problems with facsimile transmissions and a pending fax litigation case  iii we failed to disclose all patent infringement claims and issues  and iv that the directed share program suffered from various infirmities 
on january   we filed our motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint 
on march   the plaintiffs filed an opposition to that motion 
pursuant to the scheduling order in effect  our reply brief is due by april  we cannot  however  determine the outcome or resolution of these claims or the timing for their resolution 
in addition to the expense and burden incurred in defending this litigation and any damages that we may suffer  our management s efforts and attention may be diverted from the ordinary business operations in order to address these claims 
if the final resolution of this litigation is unfavorable to us  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected if our existing insurance coverage is unavailable or inadequate to resolve the matter 
we may incur significant costs and harm to our reputation from lawsuits and regulatory inquiries related to our business practices  which may also divert the attention of our management from other aspects of our business 
we have been named in several purported class actions in california  new jersey  and washington alleging a wide variety of deficiencies with respect to our business practices  marketing disclosures  email marketing and quality issues for both phone and fax service 
we have also been subject to periodic regulatory inquiries regarding our business practices 
class action litigation and regulatory inquiries of these types are often expensive and time consuming and their outcome may be uncertain 
any such claims or regulatory inquiries  whether successful or not  could require us to devote significant amounts of monetary or human resources to defend ourselves and could harm our reputation 
we may need to spend significant amounts on our legal defense  senior management may be required to divert their attention from other portions of our business  new product launches may be deferred or canceled as a result of any proceedings  and we may be required to make changes to our present and planned products or services 
if  as a result of any proceedings  a judgment is rendered vonage annual report 
table of contents or a decree is entered against us  it may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation 
our credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks or increase existing reserves in certain circumstances 
the initiation of such holdbacks or increased reserves likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our credit card processors have established reserves to cover any exposure that they may have as we collect revenue in advance of providing services to our customers  which is a customary practice for companies that bill their customers in advance of providing services 
as such  we have provided our credit card processors with cash reserves of  and a cash collateralized letter of credit for  as of december  under our credit card processing agreements with our visa mastercard  american express and discover credit card processors  the credit card processor has the right  in certain circumstances  including adverse events affecting our business  to impose a holdback of our advanced payments purchased using a visa mastercard  american express or discover credit card  as applicable  or demand additional reserves or other security 
if circumstances were to occur that would allow any of these processors to initiate a holdback or considerably increase reserves  such as our inability to repurchase  refinance or restructure our convertible notes  the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be significant 
in addition  our visa mastercard credit card processing agreement may be terminated by the credit card processor at its discretion if we are deemed to be financially insecure 
as a significant portion of payments to us are made through visa and mastercard credit cards  if the credit card processor does not assist in transitioning our business to another credit card processor  the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be significant 
we are dependent on a small number of individuals  and if we lose key personnel upon whom we are dependent  our business will be adversely affected 
many of the key responsibilities of our business have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals 
our future success depends to a considerable degree on the vision  skills  experience and effort of our senior management  including jeffrey citron  our founder  chairman  chief strategist and interim chief executive officer  john rego  our chief financial officer  louis mamakos  our chief technology officer  and jamie haenggi  our chief marketing officer 
we may add additional senior personnel in the future 
if we lose the services of any of our key employees  or if members of our management team do not work well together  it would have an adverse effect on our business 
in particular  mr 
citron has been the driving force in the development of our business to date  and he will continue to be in charge of our overall strategy and be closely involved with our technology and other aspects of our business 
however  mr 
citron could decide to resign as our chairman  chief strategist and interim chief executive officer  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
demand for information technology and engineering personnel is high  and the media impact from our patent infringement litigation combined with our prior reduction in force and need to refinance our convertible notes have negatively affected our ability to attract and retain such personnel 
if we fail to hire and train these additional information technology and engineering personnel  our business  operating results and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
the media impact from our patent infringement litigation  our prior reductions in force and the need to refinance our convertible notes have negatively affected our ability to attract and retain personnel in our information technology and engineering departments 
as a result  there is significant strain being placed on our employees and  consequently  our operations 
if we are not able to hire  train and retain necessary personnel  specifically employees with expertise in information technology and engineering  we may have to make increasing demands on our already stressed resources 
the quality of our services could suffer  which could negatively affect our brand  operating results and financial position 
regulation of voip services is developing and therefore uncertain  and future legislative  regulatory or judicial actions could adversely affect our business and expose us to liability 
our business has developed in an environment largely free from government regulation 
however  the united states and other countries have begun to assert regulatory authority over voip and are continuing to evaluate how voip will be regulated in the future 
both the application of existing rules to us and our competitors and the effects of future regulatory developments are uncertain 

table of contents part i future legislative  judicial or other regulatory actions could have a negative effect on our business 
if we become subject to the rules and regulations applicable to telecommunications providers in individual states  we may incur significant litigation and compliance costs  and we may have to restructure our service offerings  exit certain markets or raise the price of our services  any of which could cause our services to be less attractive to customers 
in addition  future regulatory developments could increase our cost of doing business and limit our growth 
our international operations are also subject to regulatory risks  including the risk that regulations in some jurisdictions will prohibit us from providing our services cost effectively or at all  which could limit our growth 
currently  there are several countries where regulations prohibit us from offering service 
in addition  because customers can use our services almost anywhere that a broadband internet connection is available  including countries where providing voip services is illegal  the governments of those countries may attempt to assert jurisdiction over us  which could expose us to significant liability and regulation 
the past background of our founder  chairman  chief strategist and interim chief executive officer  jeffrey a 
citron  may adversely affect our ability to enter into business relationships and may have other adverse effects on our business 
prior to joining vonage  mr 
citron was associated with datek securities corporation and datek online holdings corp  including as an employee of  and consultant for  datek securities and  later  as one of the principal executive officers and largest stockholders of datek online 
datek online  which was formed in early following a reorganization of the datek business  was a large online brokerage firm 
datek securities was a registered broker dealer that engaged in a number of businesses  including proprietary trading and order execution services 
during a portion of the time mr 
citron was associated with datek securities  the sec alleged that datek securities  mr 
citron and other individuals participated in an extensive fraudulent scheme involving improper use of the nasdaq stock market s small order execution system  or soes 
datek securities through its successor icapital markets llc  mr 
citron and other individuals entered into settlements with the sec in and  which resulted in extensive fines  bans from future association with securities brokers or dealers and enjoinments against future violations of certain us securities laws 
the nasd previously had imposed disciplinary action against datek securities  mr 
citron and other individuals in connection with alleged violations of the rules and regulations regarding the soes 
there is a risk that some third parties will not do business with us  that some prospective investors will not purchase our securities or that some customers may be wary of signing up for service with us as a result of allegations against mr 
citron and his past sec and nasd settlements 
we believe that some financial institutions and accounting firms have declined to enter into business relationships with us in the past  at least in part because of these matters 
other institutions and potential business associates may not be able to do business with us because of internal policies that restrict associations with individuals who have entered into sec and nasd settlements 
while we believe that these matters have not had a material impact on our business  they may have a greater impact on us while we are a public company  including by adversely affecting our ability to enter into commercial relationships with third parties that we need to effectively and competitively grow our business 
further  should mr 
citron in the future be accused of  or be shown to have engaged in  additional improper or illegal activities  the impact of those accusations or the potential penalties from such activities could be exacerbated because of the matters discussed above 
if any of these risks were to be realized  there could be a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our common stock 
as a result of being a public company  we incur increased costs that may place a strain on our resources or divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
as a public company  we incur additional legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
the exchange act requires us to file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition  which requires us to incur legal and accounting expenses 
the sarbanes oxley act requires us to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  vonage annual report 
table of contents significant resources and management oversight are required 
the corporate governance rules and regulations of the sec and the new york stock exchange have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly 
these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources and may divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
jeffrey a 
citron  our founder  chairman  chief strategist  interim chief executive office and principal stockholder  exerts significant influence over us 
as of december   mr 
citron beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock  including outstanding securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock held by mr 
citron 
as a result  mr 
citron is able to exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval  including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions 
in addition  as our chairman  chief strategist and interim chief executive officer  mr 
citron has and will continue to have significant influence over our strategy  technology and other matters 
mr 
citron s interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock 
we may be unable to fully realize the benefits of our net operating loss nol carryforwards if an ownership change occurs 
if we were to experience a change in ownership under section of the internal revenue code section  the nol carryforward limitations under section would impose an annual limit on the amount of the future taxable income that may be offset by our nol generated prior to the change in ownership 
if a change in ownership were to occur  we may be unable to use a significant portion of our nol to offset future taxable income 
in general  a change in ownership occurs when  as of any testing date  there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of the corporation held by stockholders of more than percentage points over an applicable three year period 
for these purposes  a stockholder is generally any person or group of persons that at any time during an applicable three year period has owned or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  persons who own less than of the outstanding common stock are grouped together as one or more public group stockholders

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile  and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
securities markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations 
this market volatility  as well as general economic conditions  could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price of our shares 
these factors include judgments in our litigation  changes in our earnings or variations in operating results  any shortfall in revenue or increase in losses from levels expected by securities analysts  changes in regulatory policies or tax law  our efforts to repurchase  refinance or restructure our convertible notes  operating performance of companies comparable to us  and general economic trends and other external factors 
if any of these factors causes the price of our common stock to fall  investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above their respective purchase prices 
our stock price may decline due to sales of shares by our other stockholders 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that these sales may occur  may adversely affect the price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future 
there were  shares of our common stock outstanding as of february  all shares sold in our initial public offering are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the securities act  subject to restrictions that may be applicable to our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act

our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and we may not be able to maintain that listing  which may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares 
our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange 
the new york stock exchange has several quantitative and qualitative requirements companies must comply with to maintain this listing  including a minimum closing price 
while we believe we are currently in compliance with all new york stock exchange requirements  we may not maintain compliance in the future 
if we are delisted from the new york stock exchange  our common stock may be considered a penny stock under the regulations of the securities and exchange commission and would therefore be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our securities 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit market liquidity of the common stock and your ability to sell our securities in the secondary market 
this lack of liquidity would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and convertible notes and the terms of certain settlement agreements to which we are a party contain provisions that could delay or discourage a takeover attempt  which could prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may make it more difficult for  or have the effect of discouraging  a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our board of directors and management

in addition  our convertible notes provide that upon a change of control  holders may require us to redeem all or a portion of their convertible notes at a price equal to the principal amount of notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest and potentially a premium 
further  we were named as a defendant in several suits that relate to patent infringement and recently entered into agreements to settle certain of the suits 
see item legal proceedings patent litigation 
certain terms of those agreements  including licenses and covenants not to sue  will be restricted upon a change of control  which may discourage certain potential purchasers from acquiring us 
such provisions could have the effect of depriving stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices 
any delay or prevention of  or significant payments required to be made upon  a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares

sprint 
on october   a lawsuit was filed against us by sprint communications company lp sprint in the united states district court for the district of kansas 
sprint alleged that vonage infringed seven patents in connection with providing voip services 
on september   a jury found vonage liable for having infringed the sprint patents at issue 
the jury awarded damages in the amount of  representing of our revenue over the infringing period 
on october   we entered into a binding memorandum of understanding the mou with sprint pursuant to which we agreed to settle our ongoing patent dispute and agreed to enter into a licensing arrangement under sprint s voice over packet patent portfolio 
pursuant to the terms of the mou  each party agreed not to assert infringement against the other party for any party s current commercial business activities as of the date of the mou or previously provided commercial business activities 
we also agreed not to assert any other infringement action against sprint unless sprint first files a patent infringement claim against us for activities not licensed or not covered by the mou 
these covenants not to sue are non transferable 
the mou provides that we shall pay sprint the following  as a prepayment for telecommunications services to be purchased from sprint by us over a two year period  and  for a license for past and future use of sprint s patents 
the  prepayment for services has been recorded as a prepaid expense in the consolidated balance sheet in the fourth quarter of and will be expensed as we use the services 
we have recorded  the amount of the jury award  as selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended september  the remaining  has been recorded as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet as of september  and is being amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
the mou also provides that sprint may  at its option  elect to accept the terms and conditions of our settlement with verizon in lieu of the terms of the mou the election provision 
the mou provides  however  that sprint shall not be entitled to the financial terms of our settlement with verizon for any funds paid to verizon after the one year period following the execution of the mou  and the election provision will not apply to the extent that there are objective material adverse changes that would negatively effect us vonage material adverse change in the legal situation in the verizon matter 
an example of a vonage material adverse change that is expressly set forth in the mou is if the stay of the injunction is lifted that would prevent us from adding new customers

verizon in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia 
verizon alleged that we infringed seven patents in connection with providing voip services and sought injunctive relief  compensatory and treble damages and attorney s fees 
after trial on the merits  a jury returned a verdict finding that vonage infringed three of the patents in suit 
the jury rejected verizon s claim for willful infringement  treble damages  and attorney s fees  and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of  through february the trial court subsequently indicated that it would award verizon  in prejudgment interest on the  jury award 
the trial court issued a permanent injunction with respect to the three patents the jury found to be infringed effective april  the trial court further granted a partial stay which permits us to continue to service existing customers pending appeal  subject to deposit into escrow of a royalty on a quarterly basis

on october   we filed a motion for a review of the september th decision by the original three judge panel or the full panel of the us court of appeals for the federal circuit sitting en banc 
on october   we resolved our litigation and executed a settlement agreement with verizon

nortel networks  inc  et al 
ca no 
 seeking a declaration that three nortel patents were invalid and unenforceable 
on december   nortel answered the complaint and counterclaimed alleging infringement of numerous additional patents 
on december   we and nortel entered into the nortel mou  pursuant to which the parties agreed in principle to end the nortel delaware litigation and the texas litigation 
pending the parties entering into the definitive settlement agreement  the nortel delaware litigation and the texas litigation have been stayed 
among other things  the nortel mou provides that the parties will dismiss  with prejudice  the texas litigation and the nortel delaware litigation 
in addition  vonage agrees to release nortel customer central telephone company of texas from all claims related to the three vonage patents at issue in the texas litigation 
under certain conditions  the parties further agree to provide each other covenants not to sue  as well as licenses with respect to various patents 
the parties entered into a definitive settlement agreement on these terms on march  ipo litigation 
during september and july  vonage  several of our officers and directors  and the firms who served as the underwriters in our initial public offering ipo were named as defendants in several purported class action vonage annual report 
table of contents lawsuits arising out of our ipo 
on january   the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred all complaints to the district of new jersey 
following briefing by the various plaintiffs in order to appoint lead plaintiff  on september   the court appointed zyssman group as the lead plaintiff  and the law firm of zwerling  schachter zwerling  llp as lead counsel 
by way of order dated september   the plaintiffs were to file a consolidated amended complaint amended complaint by november   the defendants could file a motion to dismiss by january   and the plaintiffs can file opposition by march  on november   the plaintiffs filed the amended complaint  which generally alleges i defendants made misstatements regarding subscriber line growth and average monthly churn rate  ii defendants failed to disclose problems with facsimile transmissions and a pending fax litigation case  iii defendants failed to disclose all patent infringement claims and issues  and iv that the directed share program suffered from various infirmities 
on january   defendants filed its motion to dismiss the amended complaint 
on march   plaintiffs filed an opposition to that motion 
pursuant to the scheduling order in effect  defendants reply brief is due by april  although we believe that we and the individual defendants have meritorious defenses to the claims made in each of the aforementioned complaints and intend to contest each lawsuit vigorously  an adverse resolution of any of the lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuits are resolved 
we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses  if any  related to the lawsuits 
additionally  two of the firms who served as underwriters to the ipo have  pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into between us and those firms prior to the ipo  have demanded that vonage reimburse them for the costs and fees incurred by them in response to various regulatory inquiries by the nasd and nyse  among other things 
vonage has declined  to date  to reimburse those firms any fees or expenses 
we are unable to predict whether a formal action will be filed against us  to assess the likelihood of a favorable or unfavorable outcome in this event  or to estimate the amount of liability in the event of an unfavorable outcome

nebraska public service commission 
on november   the director of the nebraska telecommunications infrastructure and public safety department of the nebraska public service commission filed a complaint the psc complaint before the nebraska public service commission the npsc alleging that vonage is required to contribute to the nebraska universal service fund nusf and has failed to do so 
the psc complaint seeks an order compelling vonage to contribute to the nusf  as well as administrative penalties 
vonage is vigorously 
table of contents part i defending itself against the psc complaint 
on december   vonage filed its answer which  among other things  raised as a defense that the federal communications commission s decision preempting state application of traditional telephone company regulations applies to vonage 
on or about december   vonage also brought a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the npsc in the united states district court for the district of nebraska  seeking a declaration that npsc s assertion of state jurisdiction over vonage is unlawful and requesting an injunction with respect to the npsc s efforts to force vonage to contribute to the nusf 
a hearing related to vonage s motion for preliminary injunction took place on february  in federal court 
on march   the united states district court for the district of nebraska issued a memorandum and order granting vonage s motion for a preliminary injunction and declaratory relief 
specifically  the court enjoined the npsc from asserting state jurisdiction over vonage to force vonage to contribute to the nusf and found the npsc s assertion of state jurisdiction over vonage to force vonage to pay into the nusf is unlawful as preempted by the federal communications commission 
we are unable to assess the likelihood of further action by the npsc to overturn the relief granted to vonage in this matter or to estimate the amount of liability in the event the npsc is successful in these efforts 
regulation telephony services are subject to a broad spectrum of state and federal regulations 
because of the uncertainty over whether voip should be treated as a telecommunications or information service  we have been involved in a substantial amount of state and federal regulatory activity 
implementation and interpretation of the existing laws and regulations is ongoing and is subject to litigation by various federal and state agencies and courts 
due to the nature of the technology in use  there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to new regulations or existing regulations under new interpretations 
federal local number portability on november   the fcc released its order extending local number portability lnp obligations to interconnected voip providers 
this requirement of the order will become effective days after publication of the order in the federal register 
the order was published in the federal register on february   and the lnp requirement for interconnected voip providers becomes effective on march  in addition  the fcc held that validation of lnp requests should be based on no more than four fields for simple ports and those fields should be digit telephone number  customer account number  digit zip code  and pass code if applicable 
this part of the order was to become effective on february  on january   embarq  a local telecommunications carrier  filed a petition asking that the fcc waive the effective date of the four field validation requirement until it implements a new billing system 
on february   the fcc waived the requirement for embarq to comply with the four field validation requirement until september  the commission also  on its own motion  waived the february  for all other affected companies until july  vonage currently provides lnp 
vonage faces difficulties in executing port requests in a timely manner 
if vonage is not able to implement port requests in a timely manner after the effective date of the lnp requirement for interconnected voip provider  vonage could be subject to complaints at the fcc and or an enforcement action by the fcc 
federal universal service on june   the district of columbia court of appeals vacated the portion of the fcc universal service fund usf order which required interconnected voip providers to make double usf payments in violation of the carrier s carrier rule 
however  the court failed to decide how interconnected voip providers would recover the usf payments made to underlying carriers 
vonage continues to pursue actions to recover all methods of payments that were made from the fcc s violation of double payments and the carrier s carrier rule 
federal disability access on september   the fcc released its order extending the disability access requirements of section and to interconnected voip services and to manufacturers of specially designed equipment used to provide voip services 
the order also required interconnected voip providers to contribute to the trs fund and offer dialing for access to relay services 
vonage has complied effective october  vonage annual report 
table of contents on october   the fcc s consumer and governmental affairs bureau issued an order granting in part several waiver requests related to voip dialing 
the order waives for six months the requirement that interconnected voip service providers transmit calls to an appropriate relay provider 
in the second part of the waiver  the bureau waived for six months traditional trs providers obligation to call an appropriate psap when receiving  via interconnected voip services  a call concerning an emergency 
under the direction of the fcc waiver  vonage  as an interconnected voip service  is providing reminders to subscribers to dial directly in the event of an emergency 
federal e on september   the fcc released its voip e order 
pursuant to the order  we were required i to notify our customers of the differences between the emergency services available through us and those available through traditional telephony providers and to receive affirmative acknowledgment from all of our customers that they understand the nature of the emergency services available through our service and ii to provide e services to of our subscribers by november  we have received affirmative acknowledgment from substantially all of our customers that they understand our emergency services and therefore we are substantially in compliance with both aspects of the order 
on november   we filed a petition for extension of time and limited waiver of certain of the enhanced emergency service requirements 
to the extent the waiver is necessary and remains ungranted  we are at risk of an enforcement action including fines  penalties and or an order to cease and desist selling and marketing our services in certain areas where e service is unavailable 
we regularly update the fcc on our e deployment efforts 
as of december   we have deployed e service to of our us customer base 
federal calea on august   the fcc released an order extending the obligations of communications assistance for law enforcement act calea to interconnected voip providers 
under calea  telecommunications carriers must assist law enforcement in executing electronic surveillance  which include the capability of providing call content and call identifying information to a local enforcement agency  or lea  pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization 
the fcc required all interconnected voip providers to become fully calea compliant by may  to date  we have taken significant steps towards calea compliance  which include testing the calea solution with the fbi and delivering lawful calea requests 
we have also implemented alternative solutions that allow calea access to call content and call identifying information 
the fcc and law enforcement officials have been advised as to our calea progress and our efforts at implementing alternative solutions 
we could be subject to an enforcement action by the fcc if our calea solution is deemed not fully operational 
federal cpni on april   the fcc released its order extending the application of the customer proprietary network information cpni rules to interconnected voip providers 
the fcc s cpni rules were published with an effective date of december  cpni includes information such as the phone numbers called by a consumer  the frequency  duration  and timing of such calls  and any services features purchased by the consumer  such as call waiting  call forwarding  and caller id 
under the fcc s existing rules  carriers may not use cpni without customer approval except in circumstances related to their provision of existing services  and must comply with detailed customer approval processes when using cpni outside of these circumstances 
the new cpni requirements are aimed at establishing more stringent security measures for access to a customer s cpni data in the form of enhanced passwords for on line access and call in access to account information as well as customer notification of account or password changes 
at the present time we do not utilize our customer s cpni in a manner which would require us to obtain consent from our customers  but in the event that we do in the future  we will be required to adhere to specific cpni rules aimed at marketing such services 
vonage has implemented additional security measures for cpni designed to address the new requirements 
state telecommunications regulation in general  the focus of interconnected voip telecommunications regulation is at the federal level 
on november   the fcc declared that our service is subject to federal regulation and preempted the minnesota public utilities commission  or mpuc  from imposing certain of its regulations 
table of contents part i on us 
the fcc s decision was based on its conclusion that our service is interstate in nature and cannot be separated into interstate and intrastate components 
on march   the united states court of appeals for the th circuit affirmed the fcc s declaratory ruling preempting state regulation of vonage s service 
the th circuit found that it is impossible for vonage to separate its interstate traffic from its intrastate traffic because of the nomadic nature of the service 
as a result  the th circuit held that it was reasonable for the fcc to preempt state regulation of vonage s service 
the th circuit was clear  however  that the preemptive effect of the fcc s declaratory ruling may be reexamined if technological advances allow for the separation of interstate and intrastate components of the nomadic voip service 
therefore  the preemption of state authority over vonage s service hinges on the inability to separate the interstate and intrastate components of the service 
while this ruling does not exempt us from all state oversight of our service  it effectively prevents state telecommunications regulators from imposing certain burdensome and inconsistent market entry requirements and certain other state utility rules and regulations on our service 
state regulators continue to probe the limits of federal preemption in their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulation to interconnected voip service 
the nebraska public service commission npsc case  discussed above under the litigation section to this note  is an example of a state public utility commission attempt to extend traditional state telecommunications regulation to our service 
in this case  the npsc sought to apply state universal service funding requirements to vonage 
other states including new mexico and kansas have also asserted that they have jurisdiction to seek state universal service funding from interconnected voip providers 
we expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to interconnected voip service 
state and municipal taxes for a period of time  we did not collect or remit state or municipal taxes such as sales  excise  and ad valorem taxes  fees or surcharges taxes on the charges to our customers for our services  except that we have historically complied with the new jersey sales tax 
we have received inquiries or demands from a number of state and municipal taxing and agencies seeking payment of taxes that are applied to or collected from customers of providers of traditional public switched telephone network services 
although we have consistently maintained that these taxes do not apply to our service for a variety of reasons depending on the statute or rule that establishes such obligations  a number of states have changed their statutes as part of the streamlined sales tax initiatives and we are now collecting and remitting sales taxes in those states 
in addition  a few states address how voip providers should contribute to support public safety agencies  and in those states we began to remit fees to the appropriate state agencies 
we have also contacted authorities in each of the other states to discuss how we can financially contribute to the system 
we do not know how all these discussions will be resolved  but there is a possibility that we will be required to pay or collect and remit some or all of these taxes in the future 
additionally  some of these taxes could apply to us retroactively 
as such  we have recorded a reserve of  at december  as our best estimate of the potential tax exposure for any retroactive assessment 
we believe the maximum estimated exposure for retroactive assessments is  as of december  vonage annual report

overview we are a leading provider of broadband telephone services with over million subscriber lines as of december  our services use voice over internet protocol  or voip  technology  which enables voice communications over the internet through the conversion and compression of voice signals into data packets 
in order to use our service offerings  customers must have access to a broadband internet connection with sufficient bandwidth generally kilobits per second or more for transmitting those data packets 
we earn revenue and generate cash primarily through our broadband telephone service plans  each of which offers a different pricing structure based on a fixed monthly or annual fee 
we generate most of our revenue from those fees  substantially all of which we bill to our customers credit cards  debit cards or electronic check payments  or ecp  one month in advance 
we have invested heavily in an integrated marketing strategy to build brand awareness and drive response rates that supports our sales and distribution efforts 
we acquire customers through a number of sales channels  including our websites  toll free numbers  kiosks in shopping malls and a presence in major retailers located in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
we also acquire a significant number of new customers through refer a friend  our online customer referral program 
in  we deliberately reduced our marketing expenditures from the prior year while we revamped our marketing campaign and improved the efficiency of our cost of customer acquisition 
this reduction in spending resulted in fewer line additions in and led to a much more efficient cost of acquisition in the second half of we launched our service in the united states in october  in canada in november and in the united kingdom in may since our us launch  we have experienced rapid revenue and subscriber line growth 
while our revenue has grown rapidly  we have incurred an accumulated deficit of  from our inception through december  although our net losses initially were driven primarily by start up costs and the cost of developing our technology  more recently our net losses have been driven by our growth strategy 
in addition  we plan to continue to invest in research and development and customer care 
recently  we announced we are seeking to balance growth with profitability 
we incurred marketing expense of   and  and a net loss of  which includes  in costs related to patent litigation agreements with verizon  sprint and other companies   which includes  in costs related to verizon patent litigation judgment entered against us  and  for  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to pursue growth because we believe it will position us as a strong competitor in the long term 
although we believe we will achieve profitability in the future  we ultimately may not be successful and we may never achieve profitability 
on october   we agreed to settle our ongoing patent dispute with sprint and agreed to enter into a licensing arrangement under sprint s voice over packet patent portfolio 
the agreement provides that we will pay sprint  as a prepayment for telecommunications services to be purchased from sprint by us and  for a license for past and future use of sprint s patents 
the total amount of  was paid in the fourth quarter of on october   we resolved our litigation and executed a settlement agreement with verizon 
the terms of the agreement required us to make a payment of  on november   a federal appeals court turned down our petition for reconsideration of the jury verdict  triggering the settlement agreement that requires us to pay verizon  which was paid in the fourth quarter of vonage annual report 
table of contents on november   we reached an agreement in principle with at t to settle our ip litigation suit  which was formalized in a settlement agreement dated december  the general terms of the agreement require us to pay  over a five year period 
these settlement payments have recently reduced our cash balance significantly 
trends in our industry and key operating data a number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
also  the table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of our business for the years ended december  gross subscriber line additions net subscriber line additions subscriber lines at period end average monthly customer churn average monthly revenue per line average monthly telephony services revenue per line average monthly total direct cost of telephony services per line marketing costs per gross subscriber line addition employees excluding temporary help at period end broadband adoption 
the number of us households with broadband internet access has grown significantly 
we expect this trend to continue 
we benefit from this trend because our service requires a broadband internet connection and our potential addressable market increases as broadband adoption increases 
changing competitive landscape 
we are facing increasing competition from other companies that offer multiple services such as cable television  video services  voice and broadband internet service 
these competitors are offering voip or other voice services as part of a bundle  in which they offer voice services at a lower price than we do to new subscribers 
in addition  we believe several of these competitors are working to develop new integrated offerings that we cannot provide and that could make their services more attractive to customers 
we also compete against established alternative voice communication providers and independent voip service providers 
some of these service providers may choose to sacrifice revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at lower prices or for free 
sunrocket  an independent voip service provider  ceased operations in july the negative press surrounding sunrocket and the offerings from other providers could negatively affect our ability to acquire new customers or retain our existing customers 
subscriber lines 
our subscriber lines include  as of a particular date  all subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date 
our subscriber lines include fax lines and softphones but do not include our virtual phone numbers or toll free numbers  which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers 
in  we added  net subscriber lines and had a total of  subscriber lines as of december  the increase in our subscriber lines was directly related to an increase in our advertising spending and our expansion to other media  such as television  direct mail  alternative media and outbound telemarketing  which have a broader customer reach 
we believe we will continue to add subscriber lines in future periods  however  we do not expect to sustain our historical subscriber line growth rate on a percentage basis due to a combination of increased competition  a significantly larger and growing customer base and increasing saturation among our initial target customer base  which included many early adopters 
gross subscriber line additions 
gross subscriber line additions for a particular period are calculated by taking the net subscriber line additions during that particular period and adding to that the number of subscriber lines that terminated during that period 
this number does not include subscriber lines both added and terminated during the period  where termination occurred within the first days after activation 
the number does include  however  subscriber lines added during the period that are terminated within days of activation but after the end of the period 

table of contents part ii net subscriber line additions 
net subscriber line additions for a particular period reflect the number of subscriber lines at the end of the period  less the number of subscriber lines at the beginning of the period 
average monthly customer churn 
average monthly customer churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of customers that terminated during that period by the simple average number of customers during the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period  plus the number of customers on the last day of the period  divided by two 
terminations  as used in the calculation of churn statistics  do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first days after activation 
our average monthly customer churn was for compared to for in the fourth quarter of  our average monthly customer churn was 
we believe this increase was driven  in part  by inconsistent user experience with our service  quality of our service  increased competition and the negative press surrounding our patent infringement litigation 
as part of our effort to improve customer satisfaction and increase retention  in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  we extended our customer grace period for non payment in order to better resolve customer accounts that may be past due 
these extensions had a one time positive impact of basis points and basis points on our average monthly customer churn for the fourth quarter and the second quarter  respectively 
we monitor churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction 
other companies may calculate churn differently  and their churn data may not be directly comparable to ours 
customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a significantly lower churn rate than customers who have not 
our churn will fluctuate over time due to increased competitive pressures  market place perception of our services and our ability to provide high quality customer care and add future innovative products and services 
average monthly revenue per line 
average monthly revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
our average monthly revenue per line decreased to for compared to for we continue to expect stability in our pricing environment 
in october  we began collecting universal service fund usf from our customers  which has increased average monthly revenue per line 
in addition  an increasing number of customers are choosing the residential unlimited plan as a result of the first month free promotion  which has a positive effect on longer term average monthly revenue per line 
these increases could be negatively affected by the timing and duration of promotions such as the second line promotion introduced in late may in march  we also reduced international rates to certain countries to one cent per minute  which we believe will also decrease our average monthly revenue per line 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total telephony services revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
our average monthly telephony services revenue per line was for compared with for average monthly total direct cost of telephony services per line 
average monthly total direct cost of telephony services per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our direct cost of telephony services for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we use the average monthly total direct cost of telephony services per line to evaluate how effective we are at managing our costs of providing service 
our average monthly total direct cost of telephony services per line decreased from for to for  primarily due to the decrease in verizon royalty of per line for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  also  our fixed network costs are being spread over a larger subscriber line base 
this was offset by taxes we pay on our services including government imposed taxes such as usf 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition is calculated by dividing our marketing expense vonage annual report 
table of contents for a particular period by the number of gross subscriber line additions during the period 
marketing expense does not include the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions  which are accounted for as an offset to revenues  or customer equipment subsidies  which are accounted for as direct cost of goods sold 
as a result  it does not represent the full cost to us of obtaining a new customer 
employees 
employees represent the number of personnel that are on our payroll and exclude temporary or outsourced labor 
in the second quarter of we announced a plan to reduce our total workforce by approximately to reduce costs and improve efficiency 
we incurred one time employee termination benefit charges of  for the year ended december  regulation 
our business has developed in an environment largely free from regulation 
however  the united states and other countries have begun to examine how voip services should be regulated  and a number of initiatives could have an impact on our business 
for example  the fcc has concluded that wireline broadband internet access  such as dsl and internet access provided by cable companies  is an information service and is subject to lighter regulation than telecommunications services 
this order may give providers of wireline broadband internet access the right to discriminate against our services  charge their customers an extra fee to use our service or block our service 
we believe it is unlikely that this will occur on a widespread basis  but if it does it would have a material adverse effect on us 
other regulatory initiatives include the assertion of state regulatory authority over us  fcc rulemaking regarding emergency calling services  local number portability  disability access and proposed reforms for the intercarrier compensation system 
in addition  in the fcc concluded that voip providers must begin contributing to the usf on october  the internal revenue service  however  has discontinued the requirement to collect the federal excise tax  which we stopped collecting on september  complying with regulatory developments may affect our business by increasing our operating expenses  including legal and consulting fees  requiring us to make significant capital expenditures or increasing the taxes and regulatory fees we pay

for our retail channel customers  rebates and retailer commissions up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are also deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period of months 
for  due to the increase in churn  the customer relationship period will be reduced to months for both the direct and retail channel

the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction to telephony services revenue 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense

restated amounts in the statements of operations data reflect the removal of the income attributable to the change in fair value of derivatives embedded within the convertible notes of  and a reduction to interest expense related to the convertible notes of  in february  our management determined that it was necessary to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the three months ended june  and september  in order to correct the amount of share based compensation expense recorded by us for these periods

table of contents part ii telephony services revenue 
telephony services revenue has increased each quarter corresponding with the increase in our subscriber lines

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses generally have increased slightly on a quarterly basis 
in  selling  general and administrative cost declined primarily due to the reduction in share based compensation expense 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs for the third quarter of was due to the settlement of several ip litigation cases 
marketing 
in  marketing costs increased quarterly for several reasons 
we increased advertising in more expensive media with a broader reach  such as television  to enhance our brand awareness 
we also added additional marketing channels such as direct mail  alternative media and outbound telemarketing while reducing our reliance on online advertising as we hoped to reach more mainstream consumers 
in addition  we believe it is generally more expensive to acquire mainstream consumers than early adopters of new technologies  and we have increased our focus on more mainstream customers 
over the near term  we expect our marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition to stabilize as we diversify our marketing spend and our newer markets mature 
the decrease in marketing expense in was driven by the plan to balance growth with profitability with decreases in television  online  retail  telemarketing and direct mail advertising  which was offset by an increase in alternative media advertising

we intend to continue to pursue growth because we believe it will position us as a strong competitor in the long term 
although we believe we will achieve profitability in the future  we ultimately may not be successful and we may never achieve profitability 
we believe that revenue and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  as described below  if we are unable to refinance our convertible notes  we may not be able to meet our debt and other obligations and may be required to take certain other actions in order to meet these obligations 
as of december   we had convertible notes outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of  for and subsequent years through  we will have annual interest expense on our convertible notes of at least  unless the convertible notes are converted or repaid prior to maturity date 
this amount will increase if we pay interest in kind on these notes or if we refinance the notes at a higher rate of interest 
on december   the holders of our convertible notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of our outstanding notes 
we and our financial advisor have been engaged in preliminary discussion with certain holders of our convertible notes 
in those discussions  we have explored the possibility of a transaction in which holders would agree to forego the right to put the convertible notes in december as an inducement for holders to participate in such a transaction  we may agree to make certain modifications to the terms of the convertible notes including  but not limited to a an increase in the interest rate payable under the convertible notes  b a modification of the conversion price of the convertible notes and or c a change in maturity date of the convertible notes 
additionally  as part of a transaction  we may also agree to a redeem a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes with cash and or b issue common equity or equity type securities to participating holders 
we have not offered to engage in such a transaction and the holders have not agreed to such a transaction 
there can be no assurance that any transaction will occur 
if we are unable to refinance or restructure our notes or obtain additional debt or equity capital  on favorable terms  or at all  we may face substantial liquidity challenges and we may be forced to reduce or delay capital or other material expenditures  including significantly reducing our marketing expenditures or disposing of material assets to meet our potential repurchase and other obligations 
however  in light of the uncertainties in the credit markets  these alternatives may not be capable of being accomplished on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
although we are currently evaluating our options with respect to our convertible notes  the inability to repurchase  refinance or restructure our convertible notes could lead to our bankruptcy  reorganization  insolvency or liquidation 
because there can be no assurance that we will be successful in refinancing or restructuring the convertible notes or obtaining additional debt or equity capital  there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph highlighting this uncertainty in its report dated march  our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to successfully repurchase  refinance or restructure our convertible notes 
we also have contingent liabilities for state and local sales taxes 
as of december   we had a reserve of  if our ultimate liability exceeds this amount  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
however  we do not believe it would significantly impair our liquidity 
on october   we agreed to settle our ongoing patent dispute with sprint and agreed to enter into a licensing arrangement under sprint s voice over packet patent portfolio 
the agreement provides that we shall pay sprint  as a prepayment for telecommunications services to be purchased from sprint by us and  for a license for past and future use of sprint s patents 
the total amount of  was paid in the fourth quarter of on october   we resolved our litigation and executed a settlement agreement with verizon 
the terms of the agreement required us to make a payment of  on november   a federal appeals court turned down our petition for reconsideration of the jury verdict  triggering the settlement agreement that requires us to pay verizon  which was paid in the fourth quarter of on november   we reached an agreement in principle with at t to settle our ip litigation suit 
the general terms of the agreement 
table of contents part ii would require us to pay  over a five year period 
these settlement payments have recently reduced our cash balance significantly 
to the extent we change our plans  or if our expectations are wrong  we may need to seek additional funding by accessing the equity or debt capital markets 
in addition  although we do not currently anticipate any acquisitions  we may need to seek additional funding if an attractive acquisition opportunity is presented to us 
however  our significant losses to date may prevent us from obtaining additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
because of our historical net losses and our limited tangible assets  we do not fit traditional credit lending criteria  which  in particular  could make it difficult for us to obtain loans or to access the debt capital markets 
in addition  the terms of our outstanding convertible notes provide for additional shares to be issued upon conversion if we sell shares of our common stock after our initial public offering at a price that is less than the average trading price of our common stock over the day period prior to any such sale  which might limit our access to the capital markets 
further  the ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities may be impeded due to the events surrounding our ipo and our current stock price 
capital expenditures capital expenditures are mainly for the purchase of network equipment and computer hardware as we continue to expand our network and for the implementation of software solutions 
we continue to invest heavily in networking equipment  technology  corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure 
our capital expenditures for were  of which  was for software acquisition and development and  was for the acquisition of the sprint patents

capital lease obligations 
at december   we had capital lease obligations of  related to our corporate headquarters in holmdel  new jersey that expire in operating lease obligations 
at december   future commitments for operating leases included  for co location facilities in the united states that accommodate a portion of our network equipment through   for kiosks leased in various locations throughout the united states through  for office space leased for our mississauga  ontario office through  for office space leased for our london  uk office through purchase obligations

we also agreed to pay at t  as prepayment for the last three months of payments due under the agreement  which was paid in january summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our financial statements 
the following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including the following those related to the average period of service to a customer the customer relationship period used to amortize deferred revenue and deferred customer acquisition costs associated with customer activation  the useful lives of property and equipment  and assumptions used for the purpose of determining stock based compensation using the black scholes option model model  and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable 
the key inputs for this model are stock price at valuation date  strike price for the option  the dividend yield  risk free interest rate  life of option in years and volatility 
vonage annual report 
table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience  available market information  appropriate valuation methodologies and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition operating revenues consist of telephony services revenues and customer equipment which enables our telephony services and shipping revenues 
the point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenues  which are derived primarily from monthly subscription fees that customers are charged under our service plans 
we also derive telephony services revenues from per minute fees for international calls and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer s monthly plan limits 
monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp in advance and are recognized over the following month when services are provided 
revenues generated from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans are recognized as services are provided  that is  as minutes are used  and are billed to a customer s credit cards  debit cards or ecp in arrears 
as a result of our multiple billing cycles each month  we estimate the amount of revenues earned from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes and have been consistent with our actual results 
we also generate revenues by charging a fee for activating service 
through september  we charged an activation fee to customers in the direct channel 
beginning in july  we also began charging an activation fee in the retail channel 
customer activation fees  along with the related customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction to telephony services revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
for and  the estimated customer relationship period was months 
for  due to the increase in churn  the customer relationship period will be reduced to months 
we also provide rebates to customers who purchase their customer equipment from retailers and satisfy minimum service period requirements 
these rebates in excess of activation fees are recorded as a reduction of revenues over the service period based upon the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the rebates 
inventory inventory consists of the cost of customer equipment and is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the average cost method 
we provide an inventory allowance for customer equipment that has been returned by customers but may not be able to be re issued to new customers or returned to the manufacturer for credit 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on the assumption that we will not generate taxable income

table of contents part ii forward and other pre change tax attributes against its post change income may be limited 
the section limitation is applied annually so as to limit the use of our pre change net operating loss carryforwards to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long term tax exempt rate 
in addition  we may be able to increase the base section limitation amount during the first five years following the ownership change to the extent it realizes built in gains during that time period 
a built in gain generally is gain or income attributable to an asset that was held at the date of the ownership change and that had a fair market value in excess of the tax basis at the date of the ownership change 
section provides that any unused section limitation amount can be carried forward and aggregated with the following year s available net operating losses 
due to the cumulative impact of our equity issuances over the past three years  a change of ownership occurred upon the issuance of our previously outstanding series e preferred stock at the end of april as a result   of the total us net operating losses will be subject to an annual base limitation of  as noted above  we believe we may be able to increase the base section limitation for built in gains during the first five years following the ownership change

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no

in september  the fasb ratified the consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf no 

the scope of eitf no 
includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  usf contributions and excise taxes 
the task force concluded that entities should present these taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis  based on their accounting policy  which should be disclosed pursuant to apb opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies 
if such taxes are significant and are presented on a gross basis  the amount of those taxes should be disclosed 
the consensus on eitf no

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the british pound  the euro and the canadian dollar 
our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency 
interest rate risk we invest in a variety of securities  consisting primarily of investments in interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations and municipalities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our income from investments may decrease in the future
