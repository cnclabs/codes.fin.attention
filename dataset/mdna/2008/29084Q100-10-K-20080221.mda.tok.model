item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
under the percentage of completion accounting method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenues recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenues that incurred costs to date bear to total estimated costs 
accordingly  contract revenues and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised monthly as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from assumptions on an unusually large project or on a number of average size projects could be material 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability  which would negatively impact our cash flow from operations 
certain provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of us  or a substantial interest in us  more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock o our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  o our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of our stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  o our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  and o we are subject to provisions of delaware law  which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder becomes classified as an interested stockholder

our other international construction and facilities services segment  currently operating only in the middle east  represents our operations outside of the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
discussion and analysis of results of operations our reportable segments reflect  for all years presented  discontinued operations accounting due to the sale of our cbre joint venture interest and the sales of subsidiaries in each of and  in addition to certain reclassifications of prior years amounts among the segments due to changes in our internal reporting structure 
revenues as described in more detail below  revenues for were billion compared to billion for and billion for revenues increased in compared to primarily due to a increased awards and performance of united states construction work in the hospitality  high tech  healthcare  commercial  institutional  industrial and water wastewater treatment markets as these markets have continued to grow  b the addition of revenues from companies acquired in and and c increased demand for mainte nance retrofit work of the type provided by our mobile services in our united states facilities services segment  in part due to increased demand for more efficient energy systems 
the increased revenues for compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a strong commercial construction business cycle and to increased work for the hospitality  high tech  food and pharmaceutical markets 
as of december   our backlog was billion  and as of december   our backlog was billion 
this increase in backlog was primarily at the united states reporting segments and was due to increased demand for hospitality  healthcare  transportation and industrial construction projects  companies acquired during and increased awards due to our active pursuit of opportunities in these and other markets 
backlog is not a term recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles  however  it is a common measurement used in our industry 
backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of facilities services contracts 
however  if the remaining term of a facilities services contract exceeds months  the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only months of revenues

united kingdom construction and facilities services revenues increased million in compared to  principally due to a million increase relating to the rate of exchange for british pounds to united states dollars as a result of the strengthening of the british pound  additional facilities services and construction work  partially offset by less rail project work performed as certain of our rail projects were at or near completion as of december  and a decision not to pursue significant new projects in the rail sector 
revenues decreased million for compared to  principally due to a refocus of our facilities services strategy 
however  revenues from our commercial and transportation infrastructure construction businesses increased over revenues due to an improvement in the commercial construction market and significant transportation projects awarded to us

this segment s loss primarily reflected the negative results of its rail division 
also  negatively impacting gross profit was a million impairment charge related to an other than temporary decline in fair value of our investment in a joint venture in our united states facilities services segment 
the increase in gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of revenues for compared to primarily reflected the continuing trend in our construction project mix toward higher margin work that is typically associated with the types of projects referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph and reduced losses from one company in our united states electrical construction and facilities services segment

our consolidated cash balance decreased by approximately million from million at december  to million at december  the million in net cash provided by operating activities for  which increased million when compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities in  was primarily due to an increase in working capital as a result of an increase in net over billings related to an increase in revenues

represents primarily insurance related liabilities  a pension plan liability and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits  classified as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash payments for insurance related liabilities may be payable beyond three years  but it is not practical to estimate these payments 
we provide funding to our pension plans based on at least the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in our judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated  and therefore  have not been included in the table 
we classify these borrowings as short term on our consolidated balance sheets because of our intent and ability to repay the amounts on a short term basis 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
effective october   we replaced our pre existing revolving credit facility with an amended and restated million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires on october  it permits us to increase our borrowing to million if additional lenders are identified and or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments 
we utilized this feature to increase the line of credit under the revolving credit facility from million to million on november  we may allocate up to million of the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of our subsidiaries  and provides for borrowings in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the fee ranges from to of the unused amount  based on certain financial tests 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris nesbitt from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or united states dollar libor at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests

letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to of the respective face amounts of the letters of credit issued and are charged based on the type of letter of credit issued and certain financial tests 
in connection with the replacement of the pre existing revolving credit facility  million of prepaid commitment fees were recorded as interest expense for as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  and on september   we entered into a million term loan agreement term loan 
the proceeds were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of ohmstede and costs and expenses incident thereto 
the term loan contains financial covenants  representations and warranties and events of default 
the term loan covenants require  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
we are required to make principal payments on the term loan in installments on the last day of march  june  september and december of each year  commencing march in the amount of million  together with interest on the then outstanding principal amount 
a final payment comprised of all remaining principal and interest is due on october  the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets and substantially all of the assets of substantially all of our us subsidiaries 
the term loan bears interest at the prime commercial lending rate announced by bank of montreal from time to time at december  plus to based on certain financial tests or us dollar libor at december  plus to based on certain financial tests 
the interest rate in effect at december  was 
the outstanding amount under the term loan at december  was million reflecting a prepayment of million on december  and  because of the prepayment  we recorded as interest expense additional amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs of million 
based on the million borrowings outstanding on the term loan  if overall interest rates were to increase by  net of tax interest expense would increase approximately million in the next twelve months 
conversely  if overall interest rates were to decrease by  interest expense  net of income taxes  would decrease by approximately million in the next twelve months 
our canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  had a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million that was terminated in november the facility was secured by a standby letter of credit and provided for interest at the bank s prime rate  which was at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  one of our subsidiaries has guaranteed million of borrowings of a venture in which we have a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric a subsidiary of constellation energy  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning commercial properties 
these guarantees are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we and baltimore gas and electric are jointly and severally liable  in the event of default  for the venture s million in borrowings 
the terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies surety companies and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts 
the surety bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts  and we have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts  if any  paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees  surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts  and accordingly  our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   based on our percentage of completion of our projects covered by surety bonds  our aggregate estimated exposure  had there been defaults on all our existing contractual obligations  would have been approximately billion 
the surety bonds are issued by surety companies in return for premiums  which vary depending on the size and type of bond 
in recent years there has been a reduction in the aggregate surety bond issuance capacity of surety companies due to industry consolidations and significant losses of surety companies as a result of providing surety bonds to construction companies as well as companies in other industries 
consequently  the availability of surety bonds has become more limited and the terms upon which surety bonds are available have become more restrictive 
we continually monitor our available limits of surety bonds and discuss with our current and other surety bond providers the amount of surety bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any surety bond we have previously obtained 
however  if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are further changes in the surety industry  we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds such as letters of credit or guarantees by emcor group  inc  by seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement of a surety bond  by increasing our activities in business segments that rarely require surety bonds such as the facilities services segment and or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain  on favorable terms  sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds to replace projects requiring surety bonds that we may decline to pursue 
accordingly  if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of surety bonds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flow 
we do not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
our primary source of liquidity has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
we also maintain the revolving credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
we may also increase liquidity through an equity offering or issuance of other debt instruments 
short term changes in macroeconomic trends may have an effect  positively or negatively  on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  our focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns inasmuch as the facilities services business is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during economic downturns  such as the downturn that we experienced from through in the commercial construction industry  there were typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies like us aggressively bid more large long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires working capital until initial billing milestones are achieved 
while we strive to maintain a net over billed position with our customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained  however  we have been successful during the and periods of strong demand for non residential construction services to substantially increase our net over billed position 
our net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities  the revolving credit facility and  if required  the sale of various secured or unsecured debt and or equity interests in the public and private markets 
based upon our current credit ratings and financial position  we can reasonably expect to be able a to incur long term debt  such as the term loan of million borrowed in september to fund  in part  the purchase of ohmstede and or b to issue equity 
over the long term  our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition to the primary revenue risk factor  our ability to perform work at profitable levels is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
we believe that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available through debt or equity offerings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if we were required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain insurance matters as of december   we utilized approximately million of letters of credit issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility as collateral for insurance obligations
