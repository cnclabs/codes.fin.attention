item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview was an exceptional year in many respects 
we experienced strong sales and organic growth  particularly in our aerospace and defense businesses 
cessna set a new record with jet orders  while demand for commercial helicopters remained strong with bell helicopter recording orders 
our aircraft and defense backlog increased to billion  up from a year ago 
we strategically acquired businesses to complement our core growth areas  the most significant of which was the acquisition of united industrial corporation uic 
uic  operating through its wholly owned subsidiary  aai corporation aai  is a leading provider of intelligent aerospace and defense systems  including unmanned aircraft and ground control stations  aircraft and satellite test equipment  training systems and countersniper devices 
in addition to aai  we acquired certain assets of cav air llc  a helicopter maintenance and service center  columbia aircraft manufacturing corporation  which produces high performance  single engine aircraft  and paladin tools  a provider of tools and accessories for the telecommunications industry 
we paid approximately billion in cash for these four acquisitions 
we also made considerable investments in innovation  new product development and capacity expansion across our businesses  including the continued development of our commercial aircraft product offerings  with the bell model and the cessna cj in our finance segment  we generated significant growth in our managed finance receivables  while portfolio quality statistics remained relatively stable 
in july  our board of directors approved a two for one stock split of our common stock and increased our annual dividend by to per share 
we have continued to repurchase our common stock  spending million in to acquire approximately million shares 
with a increase in income from continuing operations during and these share repurchases  our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to per share 

gbeijpg 
diluted earnings per share are for continuing operations only 
consolidated results of operations revenues revenues increased billion  or  to billion in  compared with the primary reasons for this increase are higher manufacturing volume of billion with million at cessna  primarily related to an increase in business jet deliveries  million in bell s us government business  largely related to the h program and higher armored security vehicle asv deliveries  and a million increase in the industrial segment  principally due to higher demand at kautex  higher pricing of million  with million at cessna  million in bell s commercial business and million in the industrial segment  additional revenues from newly acquired businesses of million  primarily the acquisitions of overwatch systems and aai in the bell segment  favorable foreign exchange impact of million in the industrial segment  and a million impact from higher average finance receivables due to growth in the aviation and resort finance businesses in the finance segment 
in  our revenues increased billion  or  compared with  primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of billion  higher pricing of million and higher revenues in the finance segment of million 
segment profit segment profit increased million  or  to billion in  compared with this increase is primarily due to the following factors  which were partially offset by inflation of million higher pricing of million  with million at cessna  million in bell s commercial business and million in the industrial segment  favorable cost performance of million  which includes net charges in for the armed reconnaissance helicopter arh low rate initial production lrip program of million  the million favorable impact of the recovery of arh system development and demonstration sdd launch related costs written off in and lower charges related to the h lrip program of million  a million net benefit from higher volume  partially offset by unfavorable product mix  and profit from newly acquired businesses of million 
in  our segment profit increased million  or  compared with  primarily due to higher pricing of million  higher sales volume of million  improved cost performance of million in the industrial segment  favorable warranty performance at cessna of million and higher profit in the finance segment of million 
these increases were partially offset by inflation of million  higher spending for engineering and new product development of million  higher overhead of million in bell s commercial business and increased charges related to the h lrip program of million 
corporate expenses and other  net corporate expenses and other  net increased million in  compared with  primarily due to the following million of higher compensation expenses  largely related to stock appreciation  million of higher professional and consulting fees  related to corporate initiatives  million of increased costs for divested operations  primarily due to higher pension costs and other retained liabilities  and a million increase in our contribution to the textron charitable trust  partially offset by an million gain on an insurance settlement 
corporate expenses and other  net increased million in  compared with  principally due to million of higher share based compensation expense and million of higher incentive compensation  partially offset by million of lower expenses related to corporate initiatives 
special charges there were no special charges in or in  special charges totaled million and included million related to the disposition of the automotive trim trim business and million in restructuring expense in the industrial segment 
in  the million in special charges that were incurred in connection with the disposition of trim included million in impairment charges to write down preferred stock acquired in the disposition and million to cover exposures related to certain guarantees for leases  environmental and workers compensation matters 
income taxes our effective tax rate increased to in from in in comparison with the federal statutory rate  in we had a less favorable impact attributed to our foreign tax rate differential  a favorable impact on the rate related to the adoption of the canadian dollar as the functional currency for us tax purposes of one of our canadian subsidiaries  and a less favorable impact from tax settlements in  compared with settlements in  partially offset by a impact from lower state income taxes and a benefit related to the manufacturing deduction 
the effective tax rate decreased to in from in  largely due to the impact of these items on the effective tax rate 
discontinued operations discontinued operations primarily reflect after tax results of the fastening systems business  which was sold in operating results of our discontinued businesses are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the loss from discontinued operations primarily includes a million after tax impairment charge for the fastening systems business based on the estimated fair value less cost to sell at the time according to offers received from potential purchasers 
in  the loss from discontinued operations includes a million goodwill impairment charge related to the fastening systems business 
in addition  we recorded an after tax charge of approximately million  which included million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and million in curtailment losses for employee retirement plans 
the gain on disposal  net of income taxes  of million in primarily related to a tax benefit recorded upon the sale of intesys 
segment analysis our four reportable segments are bell  cessna  industrial and finance 
these segments reflect the manner in which we manage our operations 
segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision making purposes 
segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense  certain corporate expenses and special charges 
the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 
each segment s revenues and profit as a percentage of consolidated revenues and profit are provided below graphic bell dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog at bell helicopter backlog at textron systems bell helicopter is in the early stages of development or production for a number of government and commercial programs that are anticipated to significantly drive revenue and profit growth in future years 
government programs generally follow a three phase cycle consisting of development  transition to production and full rate production 
each phase has specific risks and operational challenges 
over the next few years  the segment s major government programs will be transitioning through various phases of this cycle 
bell helicopter programs with the us government include the v tiltrotor  the h and the arh 
bell helicopter s commercial business has invested in the commercial version of the tiltrotor aircraft and the new model during  we expect to receive faa certification of the model in the time frame 
major programs at textron systems include the asv and unmanned aircraft systems 
in the past two years  we have made significant investments to conduct research and development  transition development contracts to production  increase our production capacity and implement improved operational systems to manage anticipated growth in bell helicopter s government programs and commercial product lines 
the costs of investing in improved operational systems resulted in higher overhead expenses during due to the shorter production cycle for our commercial business  the higher overhead costs in were reflected in lower earnings in that year  however  since our government business has a longer production cycle  a portion of these costs was also absorbed into work in progress inventory  particularly for the v accordingly  as v aircraft were delivered in  the overhead expenses reflected in inventory resulted in lower margins 
while overhead expenses moderated in  we expect higher overhead costs in the future largely due to costs incurred to support significant ramp up to full rate production of the v aircraft 
during  textron systems successfully integrated its fourth quarter acquisition  overwatch systems  into its business and completed the acquisition of aai 
as a leading provider of intelligent aerospace and defense systems  including unmanned aircraft and ground control stations  aircraft and satellite test equipment  training systems and countersniper devices  aai significantly augments our product offering to the us government 
bell revenues us government business revenues increased million in for the us government business  compared with  primarily due to higher volume and mix of million and revenues from newly acquired businesses of million 
the volume increase is primarily due to the following million in higher h program revenue  principally due to delivery of the first production units  million in higher asv revenue due to a increase in deliveries to units  a million increase in v program revenue  primarily due to higher spares revenues  million in higher revenue for intelligent battlefield systems  and a million increase from sensor fused weapon deliveries 
these increases were partially offset by lower spares and service sales of million for military helicopters other than the v and lower joint direct attack munitions volume of million 
in  revenues increased million  compared with  primarily due to higher net volume and mix of million and the benefit from acquisitions of million 
the volume increase is primarily due to higher asv deliveries of million  higher arh sdd development revenues of million  increased spares and service sales of million  and additional intelligent battlefield systems volume of million  partially offset by lower v volume of million and lower h revenue of million 
commercial business in  revenues for the commercial business increased million  compared with  primarily due to higher pricing of million and revenues from newly acquired businesses of million  partially offset by lower volume of million 
volume decreased as higher helicopter deliveries of million were more than offset by lower huey ii kit deliveries of million and lower spares and service volume of million 
in  revenues increased million for our commercial business  compared with  due to higher volume of million and pricing of million 
the volume increase is primarily due to higher civil aircraft deliveries of million  higher spares and service sales of million  and additional deliveries of huey ii kits of million  partially offset by lower international military deliveries of million 
bell segment profit us government business segment profit in our us government business increased million in  compared with  primarily due to improved cost performance of million  higher net volume and mix of million  and the benefit from acquisitions of million  partially offset by the impact from inflation and pricing of million 
the improved cost performance is primarily due to million in lower charges for the h lrip program  which are discussed in more detail below  million in lower costs related to the arh sdd contract due to a million write off of launch related costs and the million impact of the subsequent partial recovery of these costs  and million in improvements with asv due to improved productivity and lower indirect costs  partially offset by million in arh lrip charges as discussed below  and million in lower v profitability largely due to a million impact from lower margin units  which have been unfavorably impacted by higher overhead costs associated with increasing production capacity  and a million award fee recognized in in  profit in our us government business decreased million  compared with the decrease was primarily due to inflation of million and unfavorable cost performance of million  partially offset by the impact of higher net volume and mix of million 
the unfavorable performance reflected higher anticipated costs for the h lrip contracts of million and charges of million related to the arh sdd contract  partially offset by favorable program performance at textron systems of million  primarily related to hurricane katrina 
h program the h program continues in development while we are concurrently working on the initial production aircraft under firm fixed price lrip contracts with the us government 
in  we recorded program charges of million related to the lrip contracts 
through the third quarter of  we recorded million in charges based on our estimate that the costs to complete would exceed contractual reimbursement during the transition to production phase 
these charges primarily reflected the impact of higher estimated incremental costs for resources added to meet the contractual schedule requirements and higher anticipated efforts in final assembly 
in the fourth quarter of  acceptance of the initial aircraft by the us government was delayed  and no aircraft were delivered 
this delay was a result of changes in the development and engineering requirements that were identified in the final stages of assembly and acceptance testing 
due to this delay and the costs associated with the additional development efforts  rework of in process units and resulting inefficiencies  and a reduction in previously anticipated learning curve improvements  we increased our estimate of the completion costs and recorded an additional million charge in the fourth quarter of during  the production process has continued to mature  and we have completed delivery of all the lot aircraft as well as the first lot aircraft 
our manufacturing performance during the year has been substantially consistent with our expectations 
prospectively  our costs are anticipated to increase primarily due to anticipated delays in receiving cabins from a supplier 
additionally  during the fourth quarter  we committed to higher pricing levels on an anticipated lot contract that will likely result in a loss once contract negotiations are finalized  primarily due to higher cabin supplier costs 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net charge of million to reflect the higher cost estimates for existing contract completion resulting from supplier delays  as well as the estimated loss resulting from our price commitment on the lot contract 
arh program the arh sdd contract is a cost plus incentive fee contract under which our eligibility for fees is reduced as total contract costs increase 
in  we continued our development activities as costs exceeded the original contract amount for this program and expensed million in unreimbursed costs related to this effort 
in the third quarter of  we reached an agreement with our customer under which we recovered million of launch related costs previously written off 
the amount included million that had been charged to our us government business and million that had been charged to our commercial business through overheads 
in december  we agreed to expand the scope of the development contract efforts on a funded basis 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed certain phases of the critical design review under the arh sdd contract and determined the initial production configuration of the aircraft  including aircraft configuration changes required by the us government 
our cost estimates based on this configuration  which included anticipated transition to production costs  exceeded the fixed pricing contained in two options the us government had under this program for the first two lrip lots 
the option for the first lrip lot expired in  while the option for the second lot for aircraft was set to expire in december at that time  we were in discussions with the us government related to the possible reinstatement of the first option  extension of the second option  delivery schedule  number of units to be exercised under the options and possible additional aircraft to be contracted  in addition to those under the options  at revised pricing 
at the end of  due to the uncertainty of this exposure and the ultimate outcome of our discussions with the us government  we did not believe that a loss was probable under the guidelines established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in march  we received correspondence from the us government that created uncertainty about whether it would proceed into the production phase of the arh program 
accordingly  we provided for losses of million in supplier obligations for long lead component production incurred at our own risk to support anticipated arh lrip contract awards 
in the second quarter of  the us army agreed to re plan the arh program  and we reached a non binding memorandum of understanding mou related to aircraft specifications  pricing methodology and delivery schedules for initial lrip aircraft 
we also agreed to conduct additional sdd activities on a funded basis 
based on the plan at that time and our related estimates of aircraft production costs  including costs related to risks associated with achieving learning curve and schedule assumptions  we expected to lose approximately million on the production of the proposed initial lrip aircraft 
accordingly  an additional charge of million was taken in the second quarter of for estimated lrip contract losses 
in december  the us government s remaining option related to production of aircraft under the original arh program expired unexercised 
we are continuing to restructure the program through negotiations with the us government  including reducing the number of units and modifying the pricing and delivery schedules previously reached under the mou 
based on the current status of these negotiations and our contractual commitments with our vendors related to materials for the anticipated production units we have procured at our risk  we have revised our best estimate of the expected loss to million  resulting in a million reduction of previously established reserves 
we expect that the initial lrip contract awards will be finalized in mid until the contract negotiations are finalized  including pricing  aircraft specifications and delivery schedules  losses related to future contract awards or additional recovery of our vendor obligations are uncertain 
commercial business in  profit increased million  compared with  primarily due to higher pricing of million and lower engineering  research and development expense of million  partially offset by inflation of million and the net impact of an unfavorable product mix of million 
lower overhead expense of million  which included a million recovery discussed above related to the arh program  was offset by higher costs of million as we streamlined our legacy commercial product line  resulting in certain vendor termination costs 
in  profit decreased million  compared with  primarily due to unfavorable cost performance of million and inflation of million  partially offset by higher pricing of million and the impact of increased volume and mix of million 
the unfavorable cost performance reflected increased overhead costs of million  the impact of the million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab program in  higher net research and development expense of million  and the million prior year impact of the resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a collaborative research and development agreement  partially offset by million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming in for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins 
cessna dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog demand in the business jet market continued to strengthen in  which was reflected in a increase in our backlog  in addition to a increase in business jet deliveries 
over the past three years  cessna has increased its annual production rate and has continued to focus on improving margins while investing in engineering  research and development in cessna s continual effort to bring new technology and products to market 
citation business jets are the largest component of cessna s revenues 
we delivered  and citation business jets in  and  respectively 
cessna revenues in  cessna s revenues increased million  compared with  due to higher volume of million  primarily due to higher citation business jet deliveries  and improved pricing of million 
in  revenues increased million  compared with  due to higher volume of million  primarily related to citation business jets  and improved pricing of million 
cessna segment profit in  cessna s segment profit increased million  compared with  primarily due to improved pricing  along with the million impact of higher volume and favorable warranty performance of million  partially offset by inflation of million and increased engineering and product development expense of million 
favorable warranty performance included the million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in related to initial model launches as discussed below  partially offset by a lower benefit of million from other favorable warranty performance a million benefit in  compared with million in 
segment profit increased million at cessna in  compared with  primarily due to improved pricing  the million impact of higher volume and favorable warranty performance of million  partially offset by inflation of million and higher engineering and product development costs of million 
favorable warranty performance included the million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in related to initial model launches as discussed below  as well as a million incremental benefit from other favorable warranty performance in a million benefit in  compared with million in 
during initial model launches  cessna typically incurs higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs generally moderate 
for the sovereign and cj production lines  in the second half of management estimated that the production lines had reached this maturity level based on historical production and warranty patterns  resulting in lower estimated warranty costs than earlier production aircraft 
accordingly  cessna has had favorable warranty performance in the past two years due to the lower point of sale warranty costs for sovereign and cj aircraft sold 
management expects improved performance on these models to continue in the foreseeable future 
industrial dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit the industrial segment includes the businesses of kautex  fluid power  greenlee  e z go and jacobsen 
during  we experienced positive organic revenue growth  largely due to double digit increases at fluid power and greenlee  including record sales at fluid power 
in the fourth quarter  greenlee expanded its product offerings through its acquisition of paladin tools  and e z go introduced its new energy efficient rxv golf car 
industrial revenues revenues in the industrial segment increased million in  compared with  primarily due to higher volume of million  favorable foreign exchange impact of million and higher pricing of million  partially offset by the divestiture of non core product lines of million 
revenues in the industrial segment increased million in  compared with  primarily due to higher volume of million  higher pricing of million and a favorable foreign exchange impact of million  partially offset by the divestiture of non core product lines of million 
industrial segment profit segment profit in the industrial segment increased million in  compared with  mainly due to improved cost performance of million  higher pricing of million  the million impact of higher volume and mix  and a million gain on the sale of land  partially offset by inflation of million 
improved cost performance was primarily attributable to cost reduction efforts at kautex  while inflation largely reflects increases in material costs 
segment profit in the industrial segment increased million in  compared with  mainly due to million of improved cost performance  higher pricing of million and the million impact of higher net volume and mix  partially offset by million of inflation and a million impact from divestitures of non core product lines 
finance dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit during  our finance segment s managed finance receivables grew by to billion  while our portfolio quality statistics remained relatively stable 
as a percentage of finance receivables  our day delinquency decreased to at the end of from at the end of  while nonperforming assets as a percentage of finance assets increased to from  respectively 
managed finance receivables include finance receivables that are owned and reported on our balance sheet  along with securitized or sold finance receivables for which risks of ownership are retained to the extent of our subordinated interests 
in  we expect continued growth in our managed finance receivables at a moderate pace and continued stability in our portfolio quality statistics 
the disruption in the credit market during the second half of had minimal impact on our finance segment s ability to access the capital markets to refinance its maturing debt obligations and to fund growth in the finance receivable portfolio 
however  this disruption in the credit markets did result in an increase in our borrowing costs 
the increase in the spread between the london interbank offered rate libor  the primary index against which our variable rate debt is priced  and the federal funds rate had an million negative impact on borrowing spreads 
this negative impact was almost completely mitigated by the issuances of new lower cost debt 
finance revenues revenues in the finance segment increased million in  compared with our revenue growth is primarily attributed to the following factors higher average finance receivables of million  primarily due to growth in the aviation and resort finance businesses  which resulted in additional revenues of million  million gain on the sale of a leveraged lease investment  and million increase in securitization income  primarily related to a million increase in the level of receivables sold into the distribution finance revolving securitization 
these increases were partially offset by the following decreases million decrease in portfolio yields related to competitive pricing pressures  million in lower leveraged lease earnings due to an unfavorable cumulative earnings adjustment attributable to the recognition of residual value impairments  and million reduction in leveraged lease earnings from the adoption of a new accounting standard 
revenues in the finance segment increased million in  compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase related to higher average finance receivables and a million increase from the higher interest rate environment  partially offset by an million decrease in other income  largely due to lower fees and securitization income 
average finance receivables increased billion from levels in the corresponding period in  primarily due to growth in the distribution  golf and aviation finance businesses 
finance segment profit segment profit in the finance segment increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a million increase in net interest margin  partially offset by an million increase in selling and administrative expenses  largely attributable to finance receivable portfolio growth and a million increase in provision for loan losses  reflecting an increase in nonperforming assets and net charge offs in the distribution finance portfolio 
net interest margin increased due to a number of factors  including the following an increase of million in securitization and other fee income as described above  and an increase of million related to growth in average finance receivables  partially offset by a million decrease in portfolio yields related to competitive pricing pressures  lower leveraged lease earnings of million due to an unfavorable cumulative earnings adjustment attributable to the recognition of residual value impairments  higher borrowing costs of million relative to the federal funds rate  a reduction in leveraged lease earnings of million from the adoption of a new accounting standard  and lower leveraged lease earnings of million due to a gain in on the sale of an option related to a leveraged lease asset 
segment profit in the finance segment increased million in  compared with  due to an increase in net interest margin 
the growth in average finance receivables generated million of higher net margin  which was partially offset by an million decrease in other income 
finance portfolio quality the following table presents information about the finance segment s portfolio quality millions  except for ratios finance receivables allowance for losses on finance receivables nonperforming assets provision for loan losses net charge offs ratio of nonperforming assets to total finance assets ratio of allowance for losses on receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables the finance segment s portfolio quality continues to be strong as indicated by low rates of delinquency and nonperforming assets 
net charge offs as a percentage of average finance receivables also remain stable and relatively low at during as compared with and during and  respectively 
nonperforming assets by business  and as a percentage of the owned finance assets for each business  are as follows dollars in millions asset based lending distribution finance golf finance aviation finance resort finance liquidating portfolios total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual finance receivables and repossessed assets that are not guaranteed by our manufacturing group 
we believe that nonperforming assets generally will be in the range of to of finance assets  depending on economic conditions 
in  the increases in nonperforming assets as a percentage of owned finance assets for asset based lending and distribution finance  compared with  relate to weakening us economic conditions  which began to have a negative impact on borrowers in certain industries 
in  the million increase in golf finance was primarily the result of two delinquent golf course mortgage loans whose operations were affected by the prolonged effects of hurricane katrina  while the million increase in asset based lending is the result of two loans in unrelated industries 
liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups 
the manufacturing group consists of textron inc  consolidated with the entities that operate in the bell  cessna and industrial segments  while the finance group consists of the finance segment  comprised of textron financial corporation and its subsidiaries 
we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group 
our manufacturing group operations include the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services  while our finance group provides financial services 
due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities  investors  rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance 
to support those evaluations  we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 
we assess liquidity for our manufacturing group in terms of our ability to provide adequate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
we also have liquidity available to us via committed bank lines of credit and the commercial paper market  as well as access to the public capital markets that provide us with long term capital at satisfactory terms 
for  we expect future significant uses of cash for our manufacturing group to include investments in businesses and new product development  capital expenditures  repurchases of common stock  dividends to shareholders and debt retirement 
for  we expect capital expenditures of about million and stock repurchases in the range of million to million shares 
we expect to fund both of these future uses of cash with cash generated by operating activities 
our finance group mitigates liquidity risk ie  the risk that we will be unable to fund maturing liabilities or the origination of new finance receivables by developing and preserving reliable sources of capital 
we use a variety of financial resources to meet these capital needs 
cash for the finance group is provided from finance receivable collections  sales and securitizations  as well as the issuance of commercial paper and term debt in the public and private markets 
this diversity of capital resources enhances its funding flexibility  limits dependence on any one source of funds  and results in cost effective funding 
the finance group also can borrow from the manufacturing group when the availability of such borrowings creates an economic advantage to textron in comparison with borrowings from other sources 
in making particular funding decisions  management considers market conditions  prevailing interest rates and credit spreads  and the maturity profile of its assets and liabilities 
on july   our board of directors approved a two for one split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the additional shares resulting from the stock split were distributed on august  to shareholders of record on august  also  on july   our board of directors approved a increase in our annualized common stock dividend rate from per share to per share and authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rate at which we expect to repurchase shares under this authorization will depend on various factors  including prevailing share price and alternate uses of cash 
manufacturing group cash flows of continuing operations in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating cash flows have increased over the past three years  primarily due to earnings growth 
changes in our working capital components resulted in a million use of cash in  a million source of cash in and a million use of cash in a significant use of operating cash is related to increased production and inventory build up primarily to support increasing sales at bell and cessna 
cash used for inventories totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
partially offsetting the use of cash for inventories  and also related to increasing sales  were customer deposits within accrued liabilities  which provided a significant source of operating cash 
net cash received from customers on deposit totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
investing cash flows have largely been driven by cash outflows for acquisitions that totaled billion in  largely due to the acquisition of aai  and million in  primarily due to overwatch systems 
other significant investing cash outflows include capital expenditures of million in  million in and million in we used million less cash for financing activities in  compared with the decrease is due principally to the issuance of million in year notes in  the paydown of million of short term debt in and a million decrease in in purchases of our common stock from in  and  we repurchased approximately million  million and million shares of common stock  respectively  under board authorized share repurchase programs 
dividend payments to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in three payments in  five payments in and four payments in finance group cash flows of continuing operations in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities cash used for investing activities decreased in  compared with  largely due to a million decrease in finance receivable originations  net of collections  a million increase in proceeds from receivable sales and securitizations  and the million impact in of cash used for an acquisition 
proceeds from receivable sales increased primarily due to the sale of million of receivables into the distribution finance revolving securitization in the first quarter of in  more cash was used for investing activities resulting in higher net cash outflows for originations of million  primarily due to increased growth in the finance receivable portfolio  partially offset by higher proceeds from receivable sales of million 
the decrease in financing cash inflows in primarily reflects a reduction in borrowings due to lower managed receivable growth in comparison with in addition  during  we used the proceeds from the sale of receivables  including securitizations to fund asset growth  instead of additional borrowings 
in  more cash was obtained from financing activities  principally due to an increase in debt outstanding to fund asset growth 
consolidated cash flows of continuing operations in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating cash flows have increased over the past three years  primarily due to earnings growth 
other sources and uses of cash from operating activities are primarily related to our manufacturing group and are discussed in more detail within the manufacturing group cash flows of continuing operations section above 
cash used for investing activities decreased in  compared with  largely due to a million decrease in finance receivable originations  net of collections excluding million from captive financing activities and a million increase in proceeds from receivable sales and securitizations collections excluding million from captive financing activities 
these decreases were partially offset by million in higher cash outflows for acquisitions 
in  we acquired four businesses  including aai  for a total outflow of billion  while in  we acquired three businesses for million  including the overwatch systems and electrolux financial corporation acquisitions 
we received less cash from financing activities in  primarily due to a reduction in borrowings  largely a result of lower managed receivable growth in comparison with in addition  during  we used the proceeds from the sale of receivables  including securitizations to fund asset growth  instead of additional borrowings 
the decrease in cash borrowed by the finance group in from was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of million in year notes by the manufacturing group in  a million decrease in the purchases of our common stock and million in lower dividend payments due to timing 
captive financing through our finance group  we provide diversified commercial financing to third parties 
in addition  this group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group  otherwise known as captive financing 
in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties 
however  in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups  cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group 
for example  when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group  the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group s statement of cash flows 
meanwhile  in the manufacturing group s statement of cash flows  the cash received from the finance group on the customer s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow 
although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups  there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing 
these captive financing activities  along with all significant intercompany transactions  are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions reclassifications from investing activities finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales cash received from customers  sale of receivables and securitizations other total reclassifications from investing activities dividends paid by finance group to manufacturing group total reclassifications and adjustments consolidated discontinued operations cash flows in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations cash flows in are primarily related to the realization of cash tax benefits 
in  cash inflows from investing activities are primarily due to net cash proceeds of million for the sale of the fastening systems business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning this sale 
capital resources the debt net of cash to capital ratio for our manufacturing group as of december  was  compared with at december   and the gross debt to capital ratio as of december  was  compared with at december  our manufacturing group targets a gross debt to capital ratio that is consistent with an a rated company 
consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community  leverage of the manufacturing group excludes the debt of our finance group 
in turn  our finance group limits its borrowings to an amount  taking into account the risk profile of its assets  consistent with a single a credit rating 
surplus capital of textron financial corporation is returned to textron inc borrowings historically have been a secondary source of funds for our manufacturing group and  along with the collection of finance receivables  are a primary source of funds for our finance group 
both borrowing groups utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs 
our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flows and satisfy certain financial ratios 
since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost  we target a long term a rating from the independent debt rating agencies 
the credit ratings and outlooks of these three debt rating agencies by borrowing group are as follows fitch moody s standard poor s long term ratings manufacturing a a a finance a a a short term ratings manufacturing f p a finance f p a outlook positive stable stable under separate shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  we may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of billion  and the finance group may issue an unlimited amount of public debt securities 
in the fourth quarter of  we issued million in year notes under our registration statement 
at december   we had billion available under our registration statement 
during  the finance group issued billion of term debt and cad million of term debt under its registration statement 
in addition  the finance group issued million of fixed to floating rate junior subordinated notes  which mature in the finance group has the right to redeem the notes at par beginning in and is obligated to redeem the notes beginning in we have a policy of maintaining unused committed bank lines of credit in an amount not less than outstanding commercial paper balances 
these facilities are in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only  and neither of these lines of credit was drawn at december  or december  our primary committed credit facilities at december  include the following amount not reserved as support for commercial letters of commercial facility paper credit paper and in millions amount outstanding outstanding letters of credit manufacturing group multi year facility expiring in finance group multi year facility expiring in the finance group is permitted to borrow under this multi year facility 
in connection with the acquisition of aai  we entered into an interim million credit facility that was subsequently terminated in january under a support agreement  textron inc is required to maintain ownership of textron financial corporation 
the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that textron financial corporation maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than and consolidated shareholder s equity of no less than million 
contractual obligations manufacturing group the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations  as defined by reporting regulations  of our manufacturing group as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied payments due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total liabilities reflected in balance sheet long term debt capital lease obligations pension benefits for unfunded plans postretirement benefits other than pensions other long term liabilities liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total manufacturing group amounts exclude interest payments 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
we also expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans in the range of approximately million to million per year over the next five years  which are not reflected in the above table 
other long term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience 
other long term liabilities  such as deferred taxes and unrecognized tax benefits  have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of december  the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts  the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 
in january  we contracted with a third party service provider for the oversight of our information technology infrastructure  including maintenance  operational oversight and purchases of hardware the it contract 
the it contract covers a year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications 
we have retained the right to approve significant design  equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider 
we can terminate the it contract for convenience prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed million at december  finance group the following table summarizes our finance group s known contractual obligations  as defined by reporting regulations 
due to the nature of finance companies  we also have contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future 
we generally borrow funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of our finance receivables 
the contractual payments and receipts as of december  are detailed below payments receipts due by period in millions less than year years years years years more than years total contractual payments commercial paper and other short term debt term debt loan commitments operating leases total contractual payments cash and receipts finance receivables operating leases total receipts cash total cash and receipts net cash and receipts payments cumulative net cash and receipts finance receivable receipts related to finance leases and term loans are based on contractual cash flows  while receipts related to revolving loans are based on historical cash flow experience 
these amounts could differ due to prepayments  charge offs and other factors 
receipts and contractual payments exclude finance charges from receivables  debt interest payments  proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items 
as shown in the preceding table  our cash and receipts are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities for the next two years 
at december   our finance group had billion in debt and million in other liabilities that are payable within the next months 
at december   our finance group had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under billion of committed revolving lines of credit  compared with billion at december  these loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused 
we are not exposed to interest rate changes on these commitments since the interest rates are not set until the loans are funded 
off balance sheet arrangements performance guarantee in  through our bell helicopter business  we formed agustawestlandbell llc awb llc with agustawestland north america inc awna 
this venture was created for the joint design  development  manufacture  sale  customer training and product support of the vh helicopter  and certain variations and derivatives thereof  to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government 
in march  awb llc received a billion cost reimbursement type subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps helicopter squadron program 
we guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract  provided that our liability under the guaranty shall not exceed of awb llc s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract 
agustawestland nv  awna s parent company  has guaranteed the remaining to lockheed martin 
we have entered into cross indemnification agreements with agustawestland nv in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party s workshare under any subcontracts received 
awb llc s maximum obligation is of the total contract value  which equates to million  for a maximum amount of our liability under the guarantee of million at december  through completion 
finance receivable sales and securitizations our finance group sells finance receivables utilizing both whole loan sales and securitizations  primarily utilizing asset backed securitization structures 
as a result of these transactions  finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet  and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels 
despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position  we generally retain a subordinated interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations  which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments 
these retained interests are more fully discussed in the securitizations section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
we utilize these off balance sheet financing arrangements to further diversify funding alternatives 
these arrangements provided net proceeds of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and net pre tax gains of million  million and million  respectively 
proceeds from securitizations include amounts received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold into a revolving conduit and exclude amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these short duration receivables 
as of december   our finance group had two significant off balance sheet financing arrangements the distribution finance revolving securitization trust and the aviation finance securitization trust 
the distribution finance revolving securitization trust is a master trust that purchases inventory finance receivables from the finance group and issues asset backed notes to investors 
the distribution finance revolving securitization trust had billion of one month libor based variable rate asset backed notes outstanding as of december  these notes each have a three year term and mature in may  and the aviation finance securitization trust purchases finance leases and installment contracts secured by general aviation aircraft 
this trust is funded through a commercial paper conduit commitment of a million revolving credit facility which expires in december as of december   the aviation securitization trust had million outstanding under its facility 
the amount of pre tax gains recorded upon the ongoing sale of receivables in these arrangements and the value of our subordinated interest are impacted by the pricing of the investor notes issued by the distribution finance securitization trust and the interest rate obtained by the commercial paper conduit which funds the aviation finance securitization trust 
the trusts have not experienced any material disruption to their funding  however  the commercial paper conduit  which provides funding to the aviation finance securitization trust  did experience an increase in borrowing spreads in critical accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below 
we believe these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
allowance for losses on finance receivables our allowance for losses on finance receivables is intended to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio  which requires the application of estimates and significant judgment as to the ultimate outcome of collection efforts and realization of collateral values  among other factors 
therefore  changes in economic conditions or credit metrics  including past due and nonperforming accounts  or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may require additions or reductions to our reserves 
for homogeneous loan pools  we examine current delinquencies  characteristics of the existing accounts  historical loss experience  underlying collateral value  and general economic conditions and trends 
we estimate losses will range from to of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool 
for larger balance commercial loans  we also consider borrower specific information  industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows 
our process involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment 
while we believe that our consideration of the factors and assumptions referred to above results in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience  changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses 
the allowance for losses on finance receivables currently represents of total finance receivables 
during the last five years  net charge offs as a percentage of average finance receivables have ranged from to 
long term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long term contracts 
these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
we account for these long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and cost of a contract 
we then recognize that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred under the cost to cost method  which typically is used for development effort or the units delivered under the units of delivery method  which is used for production effort  as appropriate under the circumstances 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and  in some cases  includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements  complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different revenues and or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of using the estimates from our long term strategic plans 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these forecasts  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
the impact of reducing our fair value estimates by would have no impact on our goodwill assessment  with the exception of our fluid handling products fhp and golf turfcare g t components 
assuming a reduction in our fair value estimates  the carrying value of these components may approximate or exceed fair value 
our operating plans and projections anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures at our fhp component to capture additional business in the oil and gas markets 
during  fhp achieved revenue growth of and operating profit growth of approximately 
we anticipate continued sales growth over the five year planning period as well as operating margin improvements 
should the revenue growth rates and operating margins over the planning period approximate historical levels  the estimated fair value would be reduced by up to approximately million and may result in the carrying value of the component exceeding its estimated fair value  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
at december   the goodwill allocated to this component totaled approximately million 
our operating plans and projections for our g t component anticipate operating margin improvements over the five year planning period resulting in high single digit margins and assume annual revenue growth of approximately 
a basis point decline in our operating margin assumptions would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately million and may result in the carrying value of the component exceeding its estimated fair value  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
at december   the goodwill allocated to this component totaled approximately million 
retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in in and  the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans  which represent approximately of our total pension assets  was and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  which fluctuate as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  the weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in for our qualified domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was in  compared with for a basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits 
the medical rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
the prescription drug rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 
warranty liabilities we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs  including parts and labor  for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years 
a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses 
we also may incur costs related to product recalls 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold  historical costs per claim  contractual recoveries from vendors  and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  including production and warranty patterns for new models 
during our initial aircraft model launches  we typically incur higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs moderate 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
securitized transactions securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts 
we may retain an interest in the assets sold in the form of interest only securities  seller certificates  cash reserve accounts and servicing rights and obligations 
at the time of sale  a gain or loss is recorded based on the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the finance receivables sold 
the allocated carrying value is determined based on the relative fair values of the finance receivables sold and the interests retained 
as such  the fair value estimate of the retained interests has a direct impact on the gain or loss recorded 
we estimate fair value based on the present value of future cash flows expected under management s best estimates of key assumptions credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
retained interests are recorded at fair value as a component of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
we review the fair values of the retained interests quarterly using updated assumptions and compare such amounts with the carrying value of the retained interests 
when the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the retained interests  we determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
when we determine the value of the decline is other than temporary  we write down the retained interests to fair value with a corresponding charge to income 
when a change in fair value of the retained interests is deemed temporary  we record a corresponding credit or charge to other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains or losses 
a hypothetical adverse change of and to the expected credit losses  residual cash flows discount rates or prepayment rate assumptions would not have a material impact on the current value of the residual cash flows associated with the retained interests 
hypothetical sensitivities should be used with caution  as the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  a change in one factor may magnify or counteract the sensitivities losses 
for example  increases in interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates that we expect to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse or settle 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
interest and penalties are accrued  where applicable 
if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt 
we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixed rate debt and adjust the mix  as necessary  based on our evaluation of internal and external factors 
the difference between the rates our manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in  or our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities 
this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
at december   floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were million  net of billion of interest rate exchange agreements  which effectively converted fixed rate debt to a floating rate equivalent 
interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the net effect of increasing interest expense for our finance group by million in and million in  and decreasing interest expense by million in foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold 
for  the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from increased revenues by approximately million and increased segment profit by approximately million 
for our manufacturing operations  we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset 
we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in managing its foreign currency transaction exposures  we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately billion at the end of and million at the end of quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business  we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading 
to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments  we utilize a sensitivity analysis 
the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables  debt excluding lease obligations  interest rate exchange agreements  foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year end 
we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 
this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a decrease in interest rates  a strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a decrease in the quoted market price of the marketable equity security
