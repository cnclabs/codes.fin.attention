the difference between changes in reported revenue the most comparable gaap measure and constant dollar revenue changes is the impact of foreign currency 
we provide constant dollar revenue changes for total company  total international  europe and asia results because we use the measure to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of items that are not under management s direct control  such as changes in foreign exchange rates 
the limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company s revenue 
this limitation is best addressed by using constant dollar revenue changes in combination with the gaap numbers 
we provide operating expense  operating income  net income and diluted eps excluding restructuring and related costs because we use these measures to analyze the earnings of the company 
management believes these measures are a reasonable reflection of the underlying earnings levels and trends from core business activities  as well as more indicative of future results 
the difference between operating expense  operating income  net income and diluted eps excluding restructuring and related costs and their most comparable gaap measures operating expense  operating income  net income and diluted eps is the impact of restructuring and related charges that may mask our underlying operating results and or business trends 
the limitation of these measures is that they exclude items that would otherwise increase the company s operating expenses and decrease the company s operating profit  net income and diluted eps 
these limitations are best addressed by using them in combination with the most comparable gaap measures in order to better understand the amounts  character and any impact of any increase or decrease on reported results

see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for additional information with respect to these charges 

table of contents global efficiency review as part of an ongoing initiative to rationalize our operating expense structure  in the fourth quarter we undertook a review of each function in our entire global organization and announced plans to transition to a reorganized  more efficient organization 
this included changes to the us sales team  a streamlined global product development organization  and reorganized support organizations around the globe 
we incurred a net restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to severance  of which million  million and million were reported in the unallocated corporate  international  and us wholesale segments  respectively 
global retail portfolio review during the third quarter of  we announced our decision to close approximately  principally larger  specialty retail stores in the us  europe and asia

for the year ended december  the international segment incurred charges of million  of which million was an impairment charge related to property and equipment and million was for severance and related costs for field employees 
we expect to incur additional charges of million  of which million relate to our us consumer direct segment and million relate to our international segment  in the first half of these expected costs primarily relate to lease termination costs 
north american apparel licensing during the first quarter of  we entered into a five year licensing agreement with phillips van heusen for the design  sourcing and marketing of apparel in north america under the timberland brand  beginning with the fall line 
we incurred a restructuring charge of million in our us wholesale segment in the year ended december  to reflect employee severance  outplacement services and asset disposal costs associated with the implementation of this strategy 
executive departure during the first quarter of  we also announced that kenneth p 
pucker  executive vice president and chief operating officer would be leaving the company effective march  mr

global reorganization during the fourth quarter of  the company announced a global reorganization to better align our organizational structure with our key consumer categories 
during the year ended december  we incurred charges of million for severance and employment related items  of which million related to our international segment and million is in unallocated corporate 

table of contents outlook in february we announced we had taken several actions to streamline our global operations which are expected to result in incremental operating expense savings of million 
these actions  when combined with our previously announced decisions to license our us apparel business  close underperforming retail stores and reorganize our us sales and global product organizations  are expected to result in million of annual operating expense savings 
the company plans to invest incrementally in consumer facing marketing spend  international expansion and other growth initiatives resulting in a recalibrated operating expense base for in the range of million 
for  we are targeting low single digit revenue declines  operating expenses in the range of million and flat to modest operating margin improvement excluding restructuring costs  compared with comparable results 
as defined  comparable results exclude million in restructuring and related costs  and approximately million in revenues associated with stores targeted for closure that generated an operating loss of approximately million 
the company believes that actions taken to rationalize its operating expense structure should offset continued soft market trends 
we anticipate our full year tax rate to be in the range of 
the company continues to target mid single digit revenue declines and improved operating contribution excluding restructuring costs for the first half of  compared with first half comparable results 
as defined  first half comparable results exclude million in restructuring and related costs  and approximately million in revenues associated with stores targeted for closure that generated an operating loss of approximately million 
we also anticipate an additional million in restructuring costs to be incurred in the first half of for charges associated with our retail closure plan and now believe total plan costs will be in the range of million  slightly below our initial estimate 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  realization of outstanding accounts receivable  the carrying value of inventories  derivatives  other contingencies  impairment of assets  incentive compensation accruals  shared based compensation and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying our critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements sales returns and allowances our revenue consists of sales to wholesale customers including distributors  franchisees and commissioned agents  retail and e commerce store revenues  license fees and royalties 
we record wholesale and e commerce store revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment to or upon receipt by our customer  depending on the country of sale and the agreement with our customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of the sale 
license fees and royalties are recognized as earned per the terms of our licensing and royalty agreements 

table of contents we record reductions to revenue for estimated wholesale and retail customer returns and allowances in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances  as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns and allowances  which are known to us but which have not yet been received 
our total reserves for sales returns and allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the actual amount of customer returns and allowances may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to sales returns and allowances are appropriate  we record either a reduction or an increase in sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates for losses relating to our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses primarily based upon our historical rate of credit losses and our knowledge of the financial condition of our customers 
our allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are appropriate  we record either an increase or decrease to selling expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of the inventory  we provide a reserve for the difference as a charge to cost of sales 
our reserves related to inventory valuation totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than our estimates  adjustments to our inventory reserves may be required 
the adjustments would decrease or increase our cost of sales in the period in which they are recognized 
derivatives we are routinely subject to currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and cash flows as we purchase and sell goods in foreign markets in their local currencies 
we use derivative instruments  specifically forward contracts  to manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our forecasted foreign currency exposures 
these derivatives are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedge instruments are recorded in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
for our derivative contracts that have been designated as hedge instruments  the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the period that the transaction that is subject to the related hedge contract is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is reported in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
we use our operating budget and forecasts to estimate future economic exposure and to determine the levels and timing of derivative transactions intended to mitigate such exposures in accordance with our risk management policies 
we closely monitor our foreign currency exposure and adjust our derivative positions accordingly 
our estimates of anticipated transactions could fluctuate over time and could vary from the ultimate transactions 
future operating results could be impacted by adjustments to these estimates and changes in foreign currency forward rates 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liabilities  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record 
table of contents contingent liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable 
we disclose a contingent liability when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
estimating probable losses requires analysis and judgment about the potential actions 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
we do not believe that any pending legal proceeding or claims will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability  we would record additional expense during the period in which the loss or change in estimate occurred 
long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  impairment is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about expected future operating performance 
those estimates of undiscounted cash flows could differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to business operations 
for  we recorded impairment charges of million associated with the closure of certain of our retail stores 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the company s global retail portfolio review 
in  no significant impairment related to the carrying value of our long lived assets was recorded 
incentive compensation accruals we use incentive compensation plans to link compensation to the achievement of specific annual performance targets 
we accrue for this liability during each year based on certain estimates and assumptions 
the amount paid  based on actual performance  could differ from our accrual 
share based compensation the company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan the esp plan rights on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility for stock options and esp plan rights and the expected term of stock options 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the company s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas r could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if the company uses different assumptions in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the company s share based compensation 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary book to tax differences and to recognize tax attributes  such as tax loss carryforwards and credits 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  an adjustment could be required in the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets  which would result in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation allowance quarterly 
we estimate the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  the estimate is refined based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the 
table of contents income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
effective january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
under fin we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority  based on its technical merits 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized a million increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was recorded as a reduction to the january  retained earnings balance 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our accounting for income taxes in connection with the adoption of fin is discussed in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the company exercises its judgment in determining whether a position meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition  based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position in light of all available evidence 
in measuring the fin liability  we consider amounts and probabilities of outcomes that could be realized upon settlement with taxing authorities using the facts  circumstances and information available at the balance sheet date 
these reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if new information becomes available  the company s judgments and estimates may change 
a change in judgment relating to a tax position taken in a prior annual period will be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
a change in judgment relating to a tax position taken in a prior interim period within the same fiscal year will be reflected through our effective tax rate

us wholesale revenues were million in  down compared to the decrease was driven primarily by anticipated declines in boots and kids footwear  and decreases in timberland apparel as we experienced soft retail demand for our apparel as we transitioned our north american apparel business to a licensing arrangement 
this decrease was partially offset by strong growth in smartwool products and timberland pro series footwear  as well as the acquisition of ipath 
us consumer direct revenues decreased to million from million reported in lower retail sales of timberland apparel  due to soft retail demand as we transitioned our north american apparel business to a licensing arrangement  as well as declines in boots and outdoor performance footwear offset increases in casual footwear  kids footwear and smartwool s e commerce business 
comparable store sales declined in a soft retail environment 
we had specialty  footwear plus  and outlet stores at december  compared to specialty and outlets stores at december  on september  we announced our plan to close approximately  principally larger  specialty stores in the united states  europe and asia 
this step is consistent with the company s strategy to open smaller  footwear focused stores in the united states 
the company also plans to close several underperforming us outlet stores 
the company had closed specialty stores under this program by the end of we expect the remaining closures to be completed in the first half of  and following the store closures we expect that there will be specialty store  factory outlet stores and to footwear plus stores in the united states

worldwide apparel and accessories revenue was million in  a decrease of compared to this decrease reflects a decline in timberland brand apparel sales worldwide  partially as a result of the transition of our north american apparel business to a licensing arrangement 
this decrease was offset in part by double digit growth in smartwool socks and apparel and the revenue associated with the acquisition of howies 
unit sales of apparel and accessories increased  while the average selling price decreased 
royalty and other revenue  which consists primarily of royalties from third party licensees and distributors  increased to million  reflecting increased sales of licensed timberland pro apparel  licensed kids apparel and growth in our international distributor business 

table of contents channels growth in our global consumer direct business was offset by continued softness in worldwide wholesale revenue 
consumer direct revenues grew to million  primarily due to growth in europe and asia from door expansion

we also plan to close several underperforming us outlet stores 
the majority of the store closures are expected to occur in the first half of  and the reduction in door count is anticipated to increase annual operating profits by approximately million  while lowering annual revenues by approximately million 
we believe that retail is an important component of our multi channel distribution strategy and will continue to operate approximately retail doors globally following these select closures 
these company managed stores  when combined with over stores and shops operated by franchise partners and distributors  will leave the company with more than timberland retail locations worldwide following the closures 
wholesale revenue was  million  a decrease compared to wholesale revenue declines in the us and europe were largely driven by sales declines in boots and kids  declines in timberland apparel and  to a lesser extent  decreases in casual and outdoor performance footwear 
these declines offset growth in asia primarily in boots and casual footwear  as well as strong growth from smartwool  timberland pro  and revenue associated with the ipath acquisition in the us gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  was compared to in this decrease reflects impacts from higher levels of off price and close out activity  higher comparable product costs  including effects from anti dumping duties on certain footwear imported into the eu  and mix impacts  including lower sales of boots and kids footwear

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and cash flows 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should mitigate a portion of the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and us dollar denominated borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt  if required  is generally used to finance long term investments 
in addition  we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our foreign currency transactions 
these derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
cash balances are invested in high grade securities with terms less than three months 
we have available unsecured committed and uncommitted lines of credit as sources of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under these credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on either lenders cost of funds  plus an applicable spread  or prevailing money market rates 
as of december   and  we had no short term or long term debt outstanding 
our foreign currency exposure is generated primarily from our european operating subsidiaries and  to a lesser degree  our asian and canadian operating subsidiaries 
we seek to minimize the impact of these foreign currency fluctuations through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency forward contracts 
these derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet 
certain of these instruments  which related to exposures  do not qualify for hedge accounting and changes in their fair value were recorded in other income expense 
these foreign currency forward contracts will expire in january the company has implemented a program that qualifies for hedge accounting treatment to aid in mitigating our foreign currency exposures and decrease the volatility of our earnings 
we began hedging the company s foreign currency exposure under this new hedging program in the third quarter of under this hedging program the company performs a quarterly assessment of the effectiveness of the hedge relationship and measures and recognizes any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings 
the foreign currency forward contracts under this program will expire in months or less 
based upon sensitivity analysis as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates would cause the fair value of our financial instruments to increase decrease by approximately million  compared with an increase decrease of million as of december  the decrease as of december   compared to december   is primarily related to a reduction in our foreign currency denominated exposures as of december  compared with december   as well as our choice to hedge a lesser portion of our forecasted exposure at december  than the portion of our forecasted exposure that was hedged at december   as determined in accordance with our foreign exchange exposure management policy
