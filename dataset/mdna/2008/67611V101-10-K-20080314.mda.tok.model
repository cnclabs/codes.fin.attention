table of contents other healthcare regulations fraud and abuse laws 
provisions of the social security act  commonly referred to as the fraud and abuse provisions  prohibit the filing of false or fraudulent claims with medicare or medicaid and the payment or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of medicare or medicaid patients or arranging for the referral of patients  or in return for the recommendation  arrangement  purchase  lease or order of items or services that are covered by the medicare or medicaid programs 
violation of these provisions could constitute a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions including imprisonment of up to five years  criminal fines of up to  civil monetary penalties of up to  per act plus three times the amount claimed or three times the remuneration offered and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
many states have adopted similar prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of medicaid and other third party payor patients 
the office of inspector general  department of health and human services oig  has published numerous safe harbors that exempt some practices from enforcement action under the federal fraud and abuse laws 
these safe harbors exempt specified activities  including bona fide employment relationships  some contracts for the rental of space or equipment  and some personal service arrangements and management contracts 
while the failure to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is unlawful  arrangements that do not satisfy a particular safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny by the oig 
we are required under the medicare conditions of participation and some state licensing laws to contract with numerous healthcare providers and practitioners  including physicians  hospitals and nursing homes  and to arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to our patients 
in addition  we have contracts with other suppliers  including pharmacies  ambulance services and medical equipment companies 
some of these individuals or entities may refer  or be in a position to refer  patients to us  and we may refer  or be in a position to refer  patients to these individuals or entities 
these arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor 
we believe that our contracts and arrangements with providers  practitioners and suppliers are not in violation of applicable fraud and abuse laws 
from time to time  various federal and state agencies  such as the oig  issue a variety of pronouncements  including fraud alerts  the oig s annual work plan and other reports  identifying practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny 
for example  in march  the oig issued a special fraud alert titled fraud and abuse in nursing home arrangements with hospices 
this special fraud alert focused on payments received by nursing homes from hospices 
the oig also issued a voluntary compliance program guidance for hospices in september we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws 
however  we cannot assure you that these laws will not be interpreted in the future in such a way as to cause us to be in violation of these laws 
hipaa fraud and abuse provisions 
portions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa impose civil monetary penalties in cases involving the fraud and abuse laws or contracting with excluded providers 
in addition  hipaa created new statutes making it a felony to engage in fraud  theft  embezzlement  or the making of false statements with respect to healthcare benefit programs  including private and government programs 
in addition  federal enforcement agencies can exclude from the medicare and medicaid programs any investors  officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud  even if the individual had no first hand knowledge of the fraud 
civil monetary penalties statute 
the federal civil monetary penalties statute prohibits any person or entity from knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims  offering to or making payments to a beneficiary to induce the beneficiary to use a particular provider or supplier  or arranging or contracting with an individual or entity that the person or entity knows or should know is excluded from the medicare or medicaid programs for the provision of items or services that may be reimbursed  in whole or in part  by the medicare or medicaid programs 
violations can result in civil monetary penalties ranging from  to  per claim or act  plus damages of not more than three times the amount claimed for each such item or service 
false claims act 
in addition to federal fraud and abuse laws  under separate statutes  the submission of claims for items and services that are not provided as claimed may lead to civil monetary penalties  criminal fines and imprisonment  and or exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act 
under the federal false claims act  in addition to actions being initiated by the federal government  a private party may bring an action on behalf of the federal government 
these private parties  are often referred to as qui tam relators  and are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government 
both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk that a healthcare company  like us  will have to defend a false claims action  pay fines or be excluded from the medicare and or medicaid programs as a result of an investigation arising out of this type of an action 
many states have enacted similar laws providing for the imposition of civil and 
table of contents criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims 
because of the complexity of the government regulations applicable to our industry  we cannot assure that we will not be the subject of one or more actions under the false claims act or similar state law 
state false claims laws 
the deficit reduction act of  or dra  which was signed into law on february  includes a provision encouraging states to adopt their own false claims act provisions by increasing the states share of any recoveries related to medicaid funds 
several states where we currently do business  have already adopted state false claims laws that mirror to some degree the federal false claims laws 
while these statutes vary in scope and effect  the penalties for violating these false claims laws include administrative  civil and or criminal fines and penalties  imprisonment and the imposition of multiple damages 
there has been an increase in enforcement activity by the states due in part to the implementation of the dra 
the stark law and state physician self referral laws 
section of the social security act  commonly known as the stark law  prohibits physicians  subject to the exceptions described below  from referring medicare or medicaid patients to any entity providing designated health services in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement 
persons who violate the stark law are subject to civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
hospice care is not specifically enumerated as a health service subject to this prohibition  however  some of the ten designated health services under the stark law  including physical therapy  pharmacy services and certain infusion therapies  are among the specific services furnished by our hospice programs 
regulations interpreting the stark law currently provide that compensation arrangements between referring physicians and a hospice will not violate the stark law 
we cannot assure you  however  that future regulatory changes will not result in us becoming subject to the stark law s prohibition in the future 
many states have also enacted physician self referral laws  which generally prohibit financial relationships with referral sources that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payments may be made 
similar penalties  including loss of license or eligibility to participate in government programs and civil and criminal fines  apply to violations of these state self referral laws 
these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we believe that our relationships with physicians do not violate these state self referral laws 
however  we cannot assure you that these laws will not be interpreted in the future in such a way as to call into question our relationships with physicians 
corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 
most states have laws that restrict or prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities  including corporations  from employing physicians and or prohibit direct or indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities 
possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physician s license  civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements 
these laws vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we contract with physicians to provide medical direction and patient care services 
a state with these prohibitions could determine that the provision of patient care services by our contracted physicians violates the corporate practice of medicine and or fee splitting prohibitions 
we structure our arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law 
however  we cannot assure you that government officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing these laws will not assert that we  or transactions in which we are involved  are in violation of these laws 
these laws may also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations 
the determinations or interpretations by a state may require us to restructure our arrangements with physicians in the applicable state 
regulation governing the privacy and transmission of healthcare information in addition to its antifraud provisions  hipaa also requires improved efficiency in healthcare delivery by standardizing electronic data interchange and by protecting the confidentiality and security of individual health data 
more specifically  hipaa calls for standardization of certain electronic patient health  administrative and financial data  privacy standards protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health information  and security standards protecting the confidentiality and integrity of electronically held individually identifiable health information 
in august  final regulations establishing standards for electronic data transactions and code sets  as required under hipaa  were released 
these standards are designed to allow entities within the healthcare industry to exchange medical  billing and other information and to process transactions in a more timely and cost effective manner 
modifications to the electronic data transactions and code sets standards were issued on february   and further modifications were issued on march  
table of contents the hipaa privacy standards are designed to protect the privacy of certain individually identifiable health information 
the privacy standards have required us to make certain updates to our policies and procedures and conduct training for our employees surrounding these standards 
sanctions for failing to comply with the hipaa privacy rules could include civil monetary penalties of per incident  up to a maximum of  per person  per year  per standard 
the final rule also provides for criminal penalties of up to  and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information  up to  and five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses  and up to  and ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell  transfer or use such information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm 
additional federal and state healthcare laws 
the federal government and all states also regulate other aspects of the hospice industry 
in particular  our operations are subject to federal and state laws covering professional services  the dispensing of drugs and other types of hospice activities 
some of our employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of medicine  respiratory therapy  pharmacy and nursing 
surveys and certification 
our operations are subject to periodic survey by government entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing and medicare and medicaid certification 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we  like other healthcare companies  receive survey reports containing deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements 
we review these reports and take appropriate corrective action if necessary 
the failure to take corrective action or to obtain  renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals  certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect our business and could prevent our hospice programs involved therein from offering services to patients or billing for those services 
in addition  laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products  services and industries 
we cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations upon our activities that might adversely affect us 
employment laws and regulations 
as a large employer  we are subject to various federal and state laws regulating employment practices 
we are specifically subject to audits by various federal and state agencies regarding our compliance with these laws 
we believe that our employment practices are in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws 
however  we cannot assure you that government officials charged with the responsibility of enforcing these laws will not assert that we are in violation of these laws  or that these laws will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretations 
we maintain an internal corporate compliance program and from time to time retain regulatory counsel for guidance on applicable laws and regulations 
however  we cannot assure you that our practices  if reviewed  would be found to be in compliance with applicable federal and state laws  as the laws ultimately may be interpreted 
compliance and continuous quality improvement programs compliance program we have a comprehensive company wide compliance program 
our compliance program provides for a compliance officer and committee  a corporate code of business conduct and ethics and standards of conduct  employee education and training  an internal system for reporting concerns on a confidential  anonymous basis  ongoing internal auditing and monitoring programs  and a means for enforcing the compliance program policies 
as part of our ongoing internal auditing and monitoring programs  we conduct periodic compliance reviews and internal regulatory audits and mock surveys at each of our medicare certified hospice programs 
if a program does not achieve a satisfactory rating  we require it to prepare and implement a plan of correction 
in certain situations we will perform a follow up audit and survey to verify that all deficiencies identified in the initial audit and survey have been corrected 
on july   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of hhs 
the cia is structured to assure the federal government of our federal health care program compliance and specifically covers clinical appropriateness of our hospice patients 
the cia imposes certain auditing  self reporting and training requirements that we must comply with 
under the cia  we have an affirmative obligation to report to the government probable violations of applicable 
table of contents federal health care laws and regulations 
this obligation could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities 
breach of the cia could subject us to substantial monetary penalties or affect our participation in the medicare and medicaid programs  or both 
we have agreed  during the five year term of the cia  to operate our compliance program in a manner that meets the requirements of the cia 
continuous quality improvement as required under the medicare conditions of participation  we have a continuous quality improvement program in place 
our continuous quality improvement program involves on going education of staff and quarterly continuous quality improvement meetings at each of our hospice programs and at our support center  quarterly comprehensive audits of patient charts performed by each of our hospice programs  and at least once a year  a comprehensive audit of patient charts performed on each of our hospice programs by our clinical compliance staff 
if a hospice program fails to achieve a satisfactory rating on a patient chart audit  we require the program to prepare and implement a plan of correction 
we then conduct a follow up patient chart audit to verify that appropriate action has been taken to prevent future deficiencies 
we continually expand and refine our compliance and continuous quality improvement programs 
specific written policies  procedures  training and educational materials and programs  as well as auditing and monitoring activities  have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business 
our programs also address specific problem areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities 
our policies  training  standardized documentation requirements  reviews and audits also specifically address our financial arrangements with our referral sources  including fraud and abuse laws and physician self referral laws 
competition hospice care in the united states is competitive 
because payments for hospice services are generally paid on a per diem basis  we compete primarily on our ability to deliver quality  responsive services 
the hospice care market is highly fragmented  and we compete with a large number of organizations  some of which have or may obtain significantly greater financial and marketing resources than us 
according to medpac  in there were approximately  medicare certified hospice programs  an increase of over according to medpac  approximately of existing hospice programs are not for profit programs 
most hospice programs are small and medium sized programs 
we also compete with a number of national and regional hospice providers  including vitas healthcare corporation  hospitals  long term care facilities  home health agencies and other healthcare providers  including those with which we presently maintain contractual relationships  that offer hospice and or palliative care services such as golden living formerly beverly enterprises  inc and manor care  inc many of them offer home care to patients who are terminally ill  and some actively market palliative care and hospice like programs 
relatively few barriers to entry exist  so other companies not currently providing hospice care may enter the hospice markets that we serve and expand the variety of services they offer 
insurance we maintain primary general occurrence basis and professional claims made basis liability coverage on a company wide basis with limits of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  both with a deductible of  per occurrence or claim 
we also maintain workers compensation coverage  except in texas  at the statutory limits and an employer s liability policy with a million limit per accident employee  with a deductible of  per occurrence 
in texas we do not subscribe to the state workers compensation program  instead we maintain a separate employer s excess indemnity coverage in the amount of million per accident employee and voluntary indemnity coverage in the amount of million per accident employee  with a million aggregate limit 
we also maintain a policy insuring hired and non owned automobiles on a company wide basis with a million limit of liability and a  deductible per occurrence 
in addition  we maintain umbrella coverage with a limit of million excess over the general  professional  hired and non owned automobile and employer s liability policies

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to significant risks inherent in our business 
as such  you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this annual report on form k 
the occurrence of any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  it could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  perhaps significantly 
if we fail to comply with the terms of our corporate integrity agreement  we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or termination from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
on july  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of inspector general of health and human services 
the cia imposes certain auditing  self reporting and training requirements that we must comply with 
if we fail to comply with the terms of our cia  we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties and or suspension or termination from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the imposition of monetary penalties would adversely affect our profitability 
a suspension or termination of our participation in the medicare and medicaid programs would have a material adverse affect on our profitability and financial condition as substantially all of our net patient service revenue is attributable to payments received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  were attributed to medicare and medicaid payments 
we are highly dependent on payments from medicare and medicaid 
if there are changes in the rates or methods governing these payments for our services  our net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline 
we are highly dependent on payments from medicare and medicaid 
approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for  and  respectively  consisted of payments  paid primarily on a per diem basis  from the medicare and medicaid programs 
because we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice care services based on the level of care provided to our hospice patients  we are at risk for the cost of services provided to our hospice patients 
the budget proposal submitted by the president to congress includes the elimination in the through medicare fiscal years of the annual inflation adjustment that we receive each year under current law and a reduction of in the annual inflation adjustment for the and 
table of contents medicare fiscal years 
in addition  the president s budget proposal included the phase out of the hospice specific wage index over a three year period 
if enacted these proposed changes could reduce overall medicare hospice expenditures by approximately billion over the next five years 
reductions or changes in medicare or medicaid funding could significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and our profitability 
we cannot predict at this time whether the reductions included in the president s budget proposal will be enacted or whether any additional healthcare reform initiatives will be implemented or whether other changes in the administration of governmental healthcare programs or interpretations of governmental policies or other changes affecting the healthcare system will occur 
reductions in amounts paid by government programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause our net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline 
beginning in july  we will be required to submit certain patient visit information with each medicare claim we submit 
we believe that our current billing system can provide this additional information  however  to the extent the vistacare acquired programs are not transitioned to our billing system prior to the effective date of this new billing requirement we may experience delays in our reimbursement 
these delays may adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
we are subject to a medicare cap amount which is calculated by medicare 
our net patient service revenue and profitability could be adversely affected by limitations on medicare payments 
overall payments made by medicare to us are subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period 
the hospice cap period runs from november st of each year through october st of the following year 
total medicare payments received by each of medicare certified programs during this period are compared to the cap amount for this period 
payments in excess of the cap amount must be returned by us to medicare 
the cap amount is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory medicare cap amount that is indexed for inflation 
the medicare cap amount is reduced proportionately for medicare patients who transferred into or out of our hospice programs and either received or will received hospice services from another hospice provider 
the medicare cap amount for the twelve month period ending october  has not been established by medicare 
once published  the new medicare cap amount will become effective retroactively for all services performed since november  the hospice cap amount is computed on a program by program basis 
our net patient service revenue for was reduced by approximately million as a result of our hospice programs exceeding the medicare cap 
our ability to comply with this limitation depends on a number of factors relating to a given hospice program  including number of admissions  average length of stay  mix in level of care and medicare patients that transfer into and out of our hospice programs 
our revenue and profitability may be materially reduced if we are unable to comply with this and other medicare payment limitations 
we cannot assure you that additional hospice programs will not exceed the cap amount in the future or that our estimate of the medicare cap contractual adjustment will not materially differ from the actual medicare cap amount 
we operate in an industry that is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation  and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to  among others payment for services  conduct of operations  including fraud and abuse  anti kickback prohibitions  physician self referral prohibitions and false claims  privacy and security of medical records  employment practices  and facility and professional licensure  including certificates of need  surveys  certification and recertification requirements  and corporate practice of medicine prohibitions 
in recent years  congress and some state legislatures have introduced an increasing number of proposals to make significant changes in the healthcare system 
changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
recently  there have been heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry 
there has also been an increase in the filing of actions by private individuals on behalf of the federal government against healthcare companies alleging the filing of false or fraudulent medicare or medicaid claims 
this 
table of contents heightened enforcement activity increases our potential exposure to damaging lawsuits  investigations and other enforcement actions 
any such action could distract our management and adversely affect our business reputation and profitability 
we were the subject of a civil investigation by the civil division of the united states department of justice doj 
on july  we entered into a settlement agreement with the doj to permanently settle the investigation for million 
as part of the settlement of the investigation we entered into a corporate integrity agreement on july  with the us department of health and human services  office of inspector general 
we paid the million settlement amount on july  see item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements 
on february  we received a letter from the texas attorney general s office notifying us that it is conducting an investigation concerning medicaid hospice services provided by odyssey and requesting approximately medical records of patients served by our programs in the state of texas 
based on the early stage of this investigation and limited information that we have at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of this investigation  the texas attorney general s views of the issues being investigated  any actions that the texas attorney general may take or the impact  if any  that the investigation may have on our business  results of operations or capital resources 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of laws  rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry could subject our current business practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services and capital expenditure programs  increase our operating expenses and distract our management 
if we fail to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations  we could become ineligible to receive government program payments  suffer civil and criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations 
for a more detailed discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate  see item business government regulation and payment structure 
almost half of our hospice patients reside in nursing homes 
changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board provided to our hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
for our hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state medicaid programs who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice per diem rate  an amount equal to at least of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
we contract with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision of certain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide medicaid nursing home patients 
we bill and collect from the applicable state medicaid program an amount equal to at least of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state s medicaid plan 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate 
government studies conducted in the last several years have suggested that the reimbursement levels for hospice patients living in nursing homes may be excessive 
in particular  the federal government has expressed concern that hospice programs may provide fewer services to patients residing in nursing homes than to patients living in other settings due to the presence of the nursing home s own staff to address problems that might otherwise be handled by hospice personnel 
because hospice programs are paid a fixed per diem amount  regardless of the volume or duration of services provided  the government is concerned that hospice programs may be increasing their profitability by shifting the cost of certain patient care services to the nursing home 
the reduction or elimination of medicare payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
in addition  changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect our ability to obtain referrals from nursing homes 
a reduction in referrals from nursing homes would adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians  nursing homes  assisted living facilities  adult care centers  hospitals  managed care companies  insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that our hospice locations serve  as well as on our ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources 
our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer hospice patients to us and may refer their patients to other hospice care providers  or not at all 
our growth and profitability depend significantly on our ability to provide good patient and family care  to establish and maintain close working relationships with 
table of contents these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by our referral sources and their patients 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets 
our loss of existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably 
moreover  we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase 
our growth strategy to develop new hospice programs in new and existing markets may not be successful  which could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
an element of our growth strategy is expansion of our business by developing new hospice programs in new markets and growth in our existing markets 
this aspect of our growth strategy may not be successful  which could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify markets that meet our selection criteria for new hospice programs  hire and retain a qualified management team to operate each of our new hospice programs  manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice programs  become medicare and medicaid certified in new markets  generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets  or compete effectively with existing programs in new markets 
our growth strategy to acquire other hospices may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing business 
in addition to growing existing programs and developing new hospice programs  an element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of other hospice programs 
we cannot assure you that our acquisition strategy will be successful 
the success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon a number of factors  including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  our ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms  including purchase price  which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers  the availability of financing on terms favorable to us  or at all  our ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquired hospices  our ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices  and our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals 
acquisitions involve a number of other risks  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the assumption of known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
the integration of acquired hospices may place significant strains on our current operating and financial systems and controls 
we may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our acquisition strategy 
on march  we announced the completion of our acquisition of vistacare for per share  or approximately million 
following the acquisition of vistacare we now operate approximately medicare certified hospice programs in states and provide hospice services to approximately  patients and their families each day 
there are significant risks associated with the integration of an acquisition of this size and scope  including the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  retention of key personnel  maintaining referral relationships and integration with our operating and financial systems and controls  our failure to successfully integrate the vistacare acquisition could adversely affect our financial and operating results 

table of contents according to medpac  an estimated of hospice programs in the united states are not for profit programs 
accordingly  it is likely that a substantial number of acquisition opportunities may involve hospices operated by not for profit entities 
in recent years  several states have increased review and oversight of transactions involving the sale of healthcare facilities by not for profit entities 
although the level of review varies from state to state  the current trend is to provide for increased governmental review  and in some cases approval  of transactions in which a not for profit entity sells a healthcare facility or business 
this increased scrutiny may increase the difficulty in completing  or prevent the completion of  acquisitions in some states in the future 
our loss of key senior management personnel or our inability to hire and retain skilled employees at a reasonable cost could adversely affect our business and our ability to increase patient referrals 
our future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel 
the loss of services of one or more of our key senior management personnel or our inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could adversely affect our future operating results 
in addition  the loss of key cers could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase patient referrals  a key aspect of our growth strategy 
competition for skilled employees is intense  and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting  retaining or training highly skilled nursing  management  cers  administrative  admissions and other personnel 
our business could be disrupted and our growth and profitability negatively impacted if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees 
a nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to grow and continue to provide quality  responsive hospice services to our patients as nursing wages and benefits increase 
we currently employ approximately  full time nurses and part time nurses 
we depend on qualified nurses to provide quality  responsive hospice services to our patients 
there is currently a nationwide shortage of qualified nurses that is being felt in some of the markets in which we provide hospice services  primarily in california 
in response to the shortage of qualified nurses in these markets  we have increased and are likely to continue to increase our wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses or to engage contract nurses until we hire permanent staff nurses 
our inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect our ability to provide quality  responsive hospice services to our patients and our ability to increase patient census in those markets 
in addition  because we operate in a fixed reimbursement environment  increases in the wages and benefits that we must provide to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in our reliance on contract nurses will negatively impact our profitability 
medical reviews and audits by governmental and private payors could result in material payment recoupments and payment denials  which could negatively impact our business 
medicare fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre payment and post payment medical reviews and other audits of our reimbursement claims 
in order to conduct these reviews  the payor requests documentation from us and then reviews that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations  including the eligibility of patients to receive hospice benefits  the appropriateness of the care provided to those patients  and the documentation of that care 
we cannot predict whether medical reviews or similar audits by federal or state agencies or commercial payors of our hospice programs reimbursement claims will result in material recoupments or denials  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
if any of our hospice programs fails to comply with the medicare conditions of participation  that program could be terminated from the medicare program  thereby adversely affecting our net patient service revenue and profitability 
each of our hospice programs must comply with the extensive conditions of participation of the medicare hospice benefit 
if any of our hospice programs fails to meet any of the medicare conditions of participation  that program may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor 
if that hospice program then fails to institute a plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor  that program could be terminated from receiving medicare payments 
for example  under the medicare hospice program  each of our hospice programs must demonstrate that volunteers provide administrative and direct patient care services in an amount equal to at least five percent of the total patient care hours provided by our employees and contract staff at the hospice program 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of volunteers at one of our hospice programs to meet this requirement  that program could be terminated from the medicare benefit if the program fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period 
any termination of one or more of our hospice programs from the medicare program for failure to satisfy the volunteer or other conditions of participation could adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability and financial condition 

table of contents on may  cms issued proposed regulations that would change the current medicare conditions of participation 
we anticipate that cms will issue final regulations in  implementing the new medicare conditions of participation 
based on the proposed regulations  w e do not expect the final regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations 
many states have certificate of need laws or other regulatory provisions that may adversely impact our ability to expand into new markets and thereby limit our ability to grow and to increase our net patient service revenue 
many states have enacted certificate of need laws that require prior state approval to open new healthcare facilities or expand services at existing facilities 
those laws require some form of state agency review or approval before a hospice may add new services or undertake significant capital expenditures 
new york has additional barriers to entry 
new york places restrictions on the corporate ownership of hospices 
accordingly  our ability to operate in new york is restricted 
these laws could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers  and competitive pressures may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market position and adversely affect our profitability 
hospice care in the united states is competitive 
in many areas in which our hospice programs are located  we compete with a large number of organizations  including community based hospice providers  national and regional companies  hospital based hospice and palliative care programs  nursing homes  and home health agencies 
some of our current and potential competitors have or may obtain significantly greater financial and marketing resources than us 
various healthcare companies have diversified into the hospice market 
for example  a few large healthcare providers  including golden living formerly beverly enterprises  inc and manor care  inc  have entered the hospice business directly or through affiliates 
relatively few barriers to entry exist in our local markets 
accordingly  other companies  including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing hospice care  may expand their services to include it 
we may encounter increased competition in the future that could negatively impact patient referrals to us  limit our ability to maintain or increase our market position and adversely affect our profitability 
if our costs were to increase more rapidly than the fixed payment adjustments we receive for our hospice services from medicare and medicaid  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice services based on the level of care we provide to patients and their families 
accordingly  our profitability is largely dependent on our ability to manage costs of providing hospice services 
medicare and medicaid currently provide for an annual adjustment of the various hospice payment rates based on the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure category of the consumer price index  however  the increases have usually been less than actual inflation 
if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced  or if our costs of providing hospice services  over one half of which consist of labor costs  which have been rising  increased more than the annual adjustment  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
in addition  cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care  including drugs and drug delivery systems  could negatively impact our profitability 
the budget proposal submitted by the president to congress includes the elimination in the through medicare fiscal years of the annual inflation adjustment that we receive each year under current law and a reduction of in the annual inflation adjustment for the and medicare fiscal years 
in addition  the president s budget proposal included the phase out of the hospice specific wage index over a three year period 
if enacted these proposed changes could reduce overall medicare hospice expenditures by approximately billion over the next five years 
reductions or changes in medicare or medicaid funding could significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and our profitability 
we cannot predict at this time whether the reductions included in the president s budget proposal will be enacted or whether any additional healthcare reform initiatives will be implemented or whether other changes in the administration of governmental healthcare programs or interpretations of governmental policies or other changes affecting the healthcare system will occur 

table of contents federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to patient privacy could require us to expend substantial sums on acquiring and implementing new information systems 
there are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns 
in particular  hipaa contains provisions that have required us to implement new systems and business procedures designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s individual health information 
the department of health and human services published final regulations addressing patient privacy on december   transaction and code set final regulations on september   and final regulations addressing the security of such health information on february  we believe we are in compliance with the requirements of the privacy regulations  transaction and code set regulations  and security regulations 
we continue to evaluate and update our processes and procedures to meet the requirements of the new standards  however  we cannot assure you that all of the parties with whom we do business will be in compliance with hipaa 
additional legislative and regulatory initiatives and changes in the interpretation of existing legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding patient privacy could result in additional operating costs  which could materially adversely affect our profitability 
our net patient service revenue and profitability may be constrained by cost containment initiatives undertaken by insurers and managed care companies 
initiatives undertaken by insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs affect the profitability of our hospice programs 
we have a number of contractual arrangements with insurers and managed care companies for providing hospice care for a fixed fee 
these payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with hospices and other healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis 
we believe that this trend may continue and may limit payments for healthcare services  including hospice services 
in addition  future changes in medicare related to medicare advantage programs could result in managed care companies becoming financially responsible for providing hospice care 
if such changes were to occur  managed care companies could be responsible for payments to us out of their medicare payments  and a greater percentage of our net patient service revenue could come from managed care companies 
as managed care companies attempt to control hospice related costs  they could reduce payments to us for hospice services 
these developments could negatively impact our net patient service revenue and profitability 
a significant reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
a significant portion of our total assets consists of intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
goodwill accounted for approximately of our total assets as of december  any event that results in the significant impairment of our goodwill  such as closure of a hospice program  sustained operating losses or denial of one or more certificate of need applications could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
professional and general liability claims and hired and non owned auto liability claims may have an adverse effect on us either because our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover the losses or because claims against us  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may adversely affect our reputation  our ability to obtain patient referrals or our ability to expand our business 
in recent years  participants in the healthcare industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits  including allegations of medical malpractice 
many of these lawsuits involve large claims and substantial defense costs 
from time to time  we are subject to these types of lawsuits 
while we maintain professional and general liability insurance  some risks and liabilities  including claims for punitive damages  are not covered by insurance 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our coverage will be adequate to cover potential losses 
while we have been able to obtain liability insurance in the past  insurance can be expensive and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
claims  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also adversely affect our reputation  our ability to obtain patient referrals or our ability to expand our business  as well as divert management resources from the operation of our business 
we have a  deductible per occurrence under our hired and non owned auto insurance coverage 
one or more severe auto accidents involving our employees could result in a significant liability expense and corresponding reduction in profitability 
we continue to evaluate our insurance program for cost effective alternative insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain cost effective insurance to adequately cover this risk 
because of conditions in the credit markets we may not be able to access our funds that are currently invested in auction rate securities without incurring a substantial loss on the disposition of such securities 
at december   we had invested million in tax exempt auction rate securities ars which are classified as current assets 
the ars held by us are private placement securities with stated maturities of no more than six months for which the interest 
table of contents rates are reset every days 
the reset dates have historically provided a liquid market for these securities as investors historically could readily sell their investments 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  we have not been able to liquidate any ars since early february of subsequent to december   we successfully liquidated million of these securities in january these securities generally have not experienced payment defaults and are backed by student loans which carry guarantees as provided for under the federal family education loan program of the us department of education and all were aaa aaa rated at december  to date we have collected all interest payments on all of our ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
if the uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or these markets deteriorate further  these securities may not provide liquidity to us when needed 
currently  there is a very limited market for these securities and further liquidations at this time  if possible  would likely be at a significant discount 
if we have to liquidate any ars at this time  we would incur significant losses 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity for our current needs without selling any ars and do not currently intend to attempt to further liquidate these securities until market conditions improve 
if our currently available resources are not sufficient for our needs and we are not able to liquidate any ars on acceptable terms on a timely basis  it could have a significant impact on our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional capital to fund our operations and finance our growth  and we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in connection with our acquisition of vistacare  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement on february  with general electric capital corporation and certain other lenders that provides us with a million term loan the term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the term loan was used to pay a portion of the purchase price and costs incurred with respect to the acquisition of vistacare 
we expect that our existing funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  anticipated hospice development and acquisition plans  debt service requirements  and other anticipated capital requirements for at least months following the date of this annual report on form k 
continued expansion of our business through the development of new hospice programs  inpatient business development and acquisitions may require additional capital  in particular if we were to accelerate our hospice program development and acquisition plans 
in the past  we have relied on funds raised through our initial public offering and private issuances of debt and equity and also through bank financing and cash flows from operations to support our growth 
in the future  required financing may not be available or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our growth strategies 
further  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted 
any new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
the credit agreement contains  and future debt agreements may contain  various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business 
the credit agreement and related documents contain  and the agreements and instruments governing future credit facilities may contain  various restrictive covenants that  among other things  require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios and may restrict our ability to incur more debt  redeem or repurchase stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  make certain investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  make certain acquisitions  merge or consolidate  and transfer or sell assets 
in addition  events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with and maintain these financial tests and ratios 
any failure by us to comply with or maintain all applicable financial tests and ratios and to comply with all applicable covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement or any other future debt agreements 
this could lead to the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding loans  the termination of the commitments to make further extensions of credit and the enforcement of other rights and remedies 
even if we are able to comply with all applicable covenants  the restrictions on our ability to operate our 
table of contents business at our discretion could harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  mergers  acquisitions and other corporate opportunities 
we are dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems to efficiently manage our business 
our information systems are essential for providing billing and accounts receivable functions 
our systems are vulnerable to various disasters  including fire  storms  loss of power  physical or software break ins and other such events 
if our systems fail or are unavailable for any reasons  our ability to maintain billing records or to pay our staff in a timely manner could be jeopardized 
our inability to effectively integrate  manage and keep secure our information systems could disrupt our operations 
our business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in  among other things  processing claims  reporting financial results  managing regulatory compliance controls and maintaining operational efficiencies 
these systems include software developed in house and systems provided by external contractors and other service providers 
to the extent that these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems  our operations could be negatively affected 
our hospice programs also depend upon our information systems for accounting  billing  collections  payroll and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement  maintain  or expand our systems properly  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches  including unauthorized access to patient data stored in our information systems  and the introduction of computer viruses to our systems 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented 
provisions in our charter documents  under delaware law  and in our stockholder rights plan could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they authorize the issuance by the board of directors of preferred stock without the requirement of stockholder approval  which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit our stockholders from amending our bylaws unless the amendment is approved by the holders of at least of our shares of common stock  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation prohibits the amendment by our stockholders of many provisions of our certificate of incorporation unless the amendment is approved by the holders of at least of our shares of common stock 
delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
under delaware law  a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the 
table of contents stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors could use this provision to prevent or delay takeovers 
in addition  purchase rights distributed under our stockholder rights plan will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without conditioning the offer on our redemption of the rights 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction 
as a result  they may limit the price investors may be willing to pay for our stock in the future

table of contents net patient service revenue net patient service revenue is the estimated net realizable revenue exclusive of our provision for uncollectible accounts from medicare  medicaid  commercial insurance  managed care payors  patients and others for services rendered to our patients 
to determine net patient service revenue  we adjust gross patient service revenue for estimated contractual adjustments based on historical experience and estimated medicare cap contractual adjustments 
net patient service revenue also does not include charity care or the medicaid room and board payments 
see item business government regulation and payment structure overview of government payments 
we recognize net patient service revenue in the month in which our services are delivered 
services provided under the medicare program represented approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
services provided under medicaid programs represented approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the payments we receive from medicare and medicaid are calculated using daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver and are adjusted based on geographic location 
the four main levels of care we provide are routine home care  general inpatient care  continuous home care and inpatient respite care 
we also receive reimbursement for physician services  self pay and non governmental room and board 
routine home care is the largest component of our gross patient service revenue  representing  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general inpatient care represented  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
continuous home care represented  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inpatient respite care and reimbursement for physician services  self pay and non governmental room and board represents the remaining  and of gross patient service revenue for these periods  respectively 
the principal factors that impact net patient service revenue are our average daily census  levels of care  annual changes in medicare and medicaid payment rates due to adjustments for inflation and estimated medicare cap contractual adjustments 
average daily census is affected by the number of patients referred and admitted into our hospice programs and average length of stay of those patients once admitted 
average length of stay is impacted by patients decisions of when to enroll in hospice care after diagnoses of terminal illnesses and  once enrolled  the length of the terminal illnesses 
our average hospice length of stay increased from days in to days in payment rates under the medicare and medicaid programs are indexed for inflation annually  however  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
on october  and  the base medicare payment rates for hospice care increased by approximately and  respectively  over the base rates previously in effect 
these rates were further adjusted geographically by the hospice wage index 
in the future  reductions in  or reductions in the rate of increase of medicare and medicaid payments may have an adverse impact on our net patient service revenue and profitability 
see item business government regulation and payment structure overview of government payments 
expenses because payments for hospice services are primarily paid on a per diem basis  our profitability is largely dependent on our ability to manage the expenses of providing hospice services 
we recognize expenses as incurred and classify expenses as either direct hospice care expenses or general and administrative expenses 
direct hospice care expenses primarily include direct patient care salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits  pharmaceuticals  medical equipment and supplies  inpatient costs and reimbursement of mileage for our patient caregivers 
length of stay impacts our direct hospice care expenses as a percentage of net patient service revenue because  if lengths of stay decline  direct hospice care expenses  which are often highest during the earliest and latter days of care for a patient  are spread against fewer days of care 
expenses are generally higher during the earliest days because of increased labor expense to evaluate the patient and determine the medical and social services needs of the family 
expenses are also normally higher during the last days of care because patients generally require greater hospice services including drugs  medical equipment and nursing care at that time due to their deteriorating medical condition 
in addition  cost pressures resulting from the use of more expensive forms of palliative care  including drugs and drug delivery systems  and increasing direct patient care salaries and employee benefit costs will negatively impact our profitability 
for our patients receiving nursing home care under a state medicaid program who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  we contract with nursing homes for room and board services 
the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice daily or hourly rate  an amount equal to at least of the medicaid daily nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at of the medicaid daily nursing home rate 
we refer to these costs  net of medicaid payments  as nursing home costs  net 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents general and administrative expenses for hospice care primarily include non patient care salaries including salaries for our general managers  directors of patient services  patient care managers  community education representatives and other non patient care staff  payroll taxes  employee benefits for our employees at our hospice programs  office leases and other operating costs 
general and administrative expenses for our support center primarily include salaries  payroll taxes and employee benefits for employees located at our support center

table of contents principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
for purposes of the period to period comparisons included in our results of operations  general and administrative expenses support center include these stock based compensation charges 
see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  stock compensation expense was recognized beginning january  for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested at january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and for all share based payments granted subsequent to january  at the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
we recognized million and million in stock compensation expense related to sfas r for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized approximately million  million and million in stock based compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock awards for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on december   the compensation committee the committee of the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration  in full  of the vesting of unvested stock options having an exercise price of or greater granted under the equity based compensation plan as amended  that are held by our current employees and executive officers 
stock option awards granted from may  through february  with respect to approximately  shares of our common stock  par value 
per share the common stock  including stock options with respect to approximately  shares of common stock that are held by our executive officers  were subject to this accelerated vesting which was effective as of december  on december   these stock options had per share exercise prices equal to or in excess of the closing price of per share of common stock as quoted on nasdaq  and  accordingly  were underwater 
we believed that  absent accelerated vesting  these underwater stock options do not serve to incentivize or retain employees 
we expected that the accelerated vesting of these stock options would have a positive effect on employee morale  retention and perception of stock option value 
the accelerated vesting would also eliminate the future compensation expense that we otherwise would have recognized in our consolidated statement of operations with respect to these options upon the adoption of sfas r 
the future expense that was eliminated as a result of the accelerated vesting of these stock options was approximately million  or million net of tax of which approximately million  or million net of tax  is attributable to options held by our executive officers 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in february  the committee approved  for certain executive officers  the exchange of selected underwater stock options for restricted stock 
the committee was concerned that the underwater stock options provided little or no financial or retention incentives to the executive officers 
the committee believes that the exchange of the underwater stock options for the restricted stock adequately addresses those concerns 
stock option awards of  shares  with a weighted average exercise price of  were exchanged for  shares of restricted stock 
of the stock option awards exchanged   shares were unvested 
the shares of restricted stock had a fair value of per share and will vest ratably over a three year period beginning february  we do not anticipate a material change to our share based compensation expense from the exchange 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes consists of current and deferred federal and state income tax expenses 
we estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately during see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and require the application of significant judgment by us  as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on our historical payment experience  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 

table of contents net patient service revenue and allowance for uncollectible accounts we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts exclusive of our provision for uncollectible accounts from medicare  medicaid  commercial insurance  managed care payors  patients and others for services rendered to our patients 
regarding commercial  managed care and other payors  payments are subject to usual and customary rates 
to determine net patient service revenue  we adjust gross patient service revenue for estimated contractual adjustments based on historical experience and estimated medicare cap contractual adjustments 
net patient service revenue also does not include charity care or the medicaid room and board payments 
we recognize net patient service revenue in the month in which our services are delivered 
due to the complexity of the laws and regulations affecting medicare and medicaid  a reasonable possibility exists that recorded estimates could change by a material amount in the future 
we maintain a policy for reserving for uncollectible accounts 
we calculate the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on a formula tied to the aging of accounts receivable by payor class 
we also reserve for specific accounts that are determined to be uncollectible 
accounts are written off when all collection efforts are exhausted 
medicare regulation the medicare cap 
various provisions were included in the legislation creating the medicare hospice benefit to manage the cost to the medicare program for hospice  including the patient s waiver of curative care requirement  the six month terminal prognosis requirement and the medicare payment caps 
the medicare hospice benefit includes two fixed annual caps on payment  both of which are assessed on a program by program basis 
one cap is an absolute dollar amount  the other limits the number of days of inpatient care 
none of our hospice programs exceeded the payment limits on general inpatient care services for the years ended december   and the caps are calculated from november through october of each year 
dollar amount cap 
the medicare revenue paid to a hospice program from november to october of the following year may not exceed the annual cap amount which is calculated by using the following formula the product of the number of admissions to the program by patients who are electing to receive their medicare hospice benefit for the first time  multiplied by the medicare cap amount  which for the november  through october  medicare fiscal year is  the medicare cap amount is reduced proportionately for patients who transferred in or out of our hospice services 
the medicare cap amount is annually adjusted for inflation  but is not adjusted for geographic differences in wage levels  although hospice per diem payment rates are wage indexed 
the medicare cap amount for the november  through october  cap year has not yet been announced by the medicare program 
we currently estimate the medicare cap amount to be approximately  for the medicare cap year ending october  the following table shows the amount accrued and paid for the medicare cap contractual adjustments for the years ended december   and  respectively accrued medicare cap contractual adjustments year ending december  in thousands beginning balance accrued medicare cap contractual adjustments medicare cap contractual adjustments medicare cap contractual adjustments discontinued operations payments to medicare fiscal intermediaries reclassification to accounts payable ending balance accrued medicare cap contractual adjustments on august   the centers for medicare medicaid services cms issued change request transmittal publishing the final medicare per beneficiary cap amount of  for the medicare cap year ended october  and indicated that the cap amount for the medicare cap year ended october  was incorrectly computed 
this cap amount was lower than the estimated cap amount that we used for due to cms s error in computing the cap amount for the medicare cap year 
as a result  the accrued medicare cap contractual adjustment of million includes million for the lower medicare cap amount and an additional million for the and medicare cap years for the estimated impact of the revised cap amounts 
includes additional accrual of million related to the medicare cap year 

table of contents includes additional accrual of million related to the medicare cap year 
medicare cap contractual adjustments reclassified to discontinued operations are related to all programs that we have discontinued and sold during and amounts were reclassified from accrued medicare cap contractual adjustments to accounts payable in december and were paid in january to the medicare fiscal intermediary 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
compliance with laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
insurance risks general and professional liability costs for the healthcare industry have increased and become more difficult to estimate 
in addition  insurance coverage for patient care liabilities and other risks has become more difficult to obtain 
insurance carriers often require companies to increase their liability retention levels and pay higher policy premiums for reduced coverage 
hired and non owned auto liability costs are a significant risk area for us  because almost all of our services are provided where our patients reside rather than in facilities that we operate 
we require our employees to maintain the state required minimum liability coverage on their vehicles 
our current hired and non owned auto liability coverage has a deductible of  per claim 
we continue to evaluate options to address this insurance risk area  however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to find cost effective insurance coverage to address this insurance risk area 
in our consolidated financial statements  we reserve for potential contingencies associated with the uninsured portion of our general and professional liability risks and hired and non owned auto liability risks  based on our experience  consultation with our attorneys and insurers and our existing insurance coverage 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired in an acquisition 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators arise 
we determine the fair value of the reporting units  which are our reportable business segments see note to our consolidated financial statements  using multiples of ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  then an indication of impairment exists 
the amount of the impairment would be the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and the fair value of the goodwill 
no impairment charges have been recorded as of december  we cannot predict that we will not incur impairment charges in the future or whether any impairment charges recorded will negatively impact our results of operations or financial position in the future

when an adr is received from one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries the claim associated with that adr is delayed until the medicare fiscal intermediary evaluates the information that we provide in response to the adr 
if a claim is denied  then we usually appeal the denial which delays payment of the claim 
until the claim subject to the adr is processed  we do not submit additional claims related to the patient s whose claim was the subject to the adr 
these factors lead to an increase in our days outstanding due to adrs from our medicare fiscal intermediaries

we reached an agreement in principle with the doj in february to permanently settle for million its investigation of certain of our patient certification  patient referral and coordination of benefits practices 
final resolution and approval of a definitive settlement and corporate integrity agreements were completed in july we also paid the million settlement pursuant to the settlement agreement on july  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we offered equity interests in our savannah  georgia and augusta  georgia hospice programs to third party investors of approximately each 
we received approximately million in proceeds from our investors from the offerings 
at december   we had invested million in tax exempt ars which we classified as current assets 
the ars held by us are private placement securities with stated maturities of no more than six months for which the interest rates are reset every days 
the reset dates have historically provided a liquid market for these securities as investors historically could readily sell their investments 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  we have not been able to liquidate any ars since early february of subsequent to december   we successfully liquidated million of these securities in january these securities generally have not experienced payment defaults and are backed by student loans which carry guarantees as provided for under the federal family education loan program of the us department of education and all were aaa aaa rated at december  to date we have collected all interest payments on all of our ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
if the uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or these markets deteriorate further  these securities may not provide liquidity to us when needed 
currently  there is a very limited market for these securities and further liquidations at this time  if possible  would likely be at a significant discount 
if we had to liquidate any ars at this time  we would incur significant losses 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity for our current needs without selling any ars and do not currently intend to attempt to further liquidate these securities until market conditions improve 
if our currently available resources are not sufficient for our needs and we are not able to liquidate any ars on acceptable terms on a timely basis  it could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that our principal liquidity requirements will be for medicare cap contractual adjustments  debt service  acquisition and implementation of a new integrated billing system  working capital  new hospice program and inpatient development  hospice acquisitions  stock repurchases and other capital expenditures 
we expect that our existing funds  cash flows from operating activities  operating leases  normal trade credit terms  our existing revolving line of credit under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our principal liquidity requirements for at least months following the date of this annual report on form k 
our future liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including receipt of payments for our services  changes in the medicare per beneficiary cap amount  changes in medicare payment rates  regulatory changes and compliance with new regulations  expense levels  capital expenditures  development of new hospices and acquisitions  government and private party legal proceedings  integration of the recently acquired vistacare hospice programs and operations and investigations and our ability to liquidate our investments in ars 

table of contents contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations as of december  that could impact our liquidity as summarized below payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt software license fees new billing system operating leases total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
interest rate and foreign exchange risk interest rate risk 
our credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate  which exposes our cash flows and results of operations to risk related to changes in market interest rates 
we are currently evaluating strategies to manage interest rate market risk 
we invest excess cash balances in money market accounts with average maturities of less than days and our short term investments generally are variable rate or contain interest reset features which causes their face value to be relatively stable 
foreign exchange 
we operate our business within the united states and execute all transactions in us dollars

payment  legislative and regulatory changes we are highly dependent on payments from the medicare and medicaid programs 
these programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  possible retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  rate freezes and funding reductions 
reductions in amounts paid by these programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services could materially adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
for the year ended december   medicare and medicaid services constituted and of our net patient service revenue  respectively 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures designed to curb increases in operating expenses 
however  our operating expenses are increasing more rapidly due to expected inflationary pressures than our rate increases and growth in patient census 
this dynamic is putting increasing pressure on our operating margins 
we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates would affect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt instruments but would not have an impact on our earnings or cash flows 
as of december   we did not have any variable rate debt instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates on any future variable rate debt instruments  which are tied to the prime rate  would affect our earnings and cash flows but would not affect the fair market value of the variable rate debt
