investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we had another year of growth and increased scalability in each of the measures we use to determine the success or failure of our business showed improvement on a year over year basis 
our revenues for the full year increased to million from million in our revenues exceeded our projections 
the million increase is a forty one percent year over year increase in revenues 
from to  our revenues had grown thirty four percent 
revenues from all of our products increased in while the majority of our revenues continue to come from our base vtl and ipstor enterprise software offerings  the percentage of revenues from our other products increased in we consider this an additional indicator of future growth 
we are pleased with the development of our company and we anticipate further revenue growth in net income for the year was million  compared with a loss of million in approximately one third of our net income number million was attributable to a net income tax benefit  which included a non recurring million tax benefit which we recorded for the year this income tax benefit is discussed below 
our income before income taxes grew approximately million from the previous year 
we had stock based compensation expense which relates to stock options and restricted stock we grant to employees  officers and directors as part of our incentive compensation plan  and to some consultants as payment for services of million in and million in  which is reflected in the net income number for each year 
we look to operating income as another measure of our progress 
this number enables us to measure and to compare our results of operations from one year to the next 
operating income for was million  compared with a loss of million in these numbers again include stock based compensation expense 
another important measure of our business is gross margin 
among other things  gross margin measures our ability to scale our business 
unlike manufacturers of hardware  our incremental cost for each additional unit of software licensed is a small percentage of the software license revenue 
thus  our gross margins tend to increase as our software license revenue increases 
we incur research and development expenses before the product is offered for licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and testing  but also include other items such as the depreciation and amortization of hardware and software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our gross margin for was compared with for the impact of the equity based compensation expense on gross margin in and was equivalent to and  respectively 
we believe that our gross margin in and the increase in our gross margin from demonstrate that we were successful in our ability to scale our business 
operating margin is a measure of operating efficiency 
our operating margin also increased 
in  our operating margin was  compared with in the impact of the equity based compensation expense on operating margin in and was equivalent to and  respectively 
in sum  each of the key measures of our business revenues  net income  operating income  gross margin  and operating margin increased from to as it has been in the past  our focus for will continue to be on managing our business with a view towards long term success and growth 
in  we continued to invest in research and development and other areas to build on our momentum  to design new products  and to enhance our existing products to position the company for future growth 
we will continue to invest in these areas in and we anticipate that our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses will all increase in 
table of contents to continue to create industry leading  cutting edge network storage solutions  we hired additional software development engineers and quality assurance engineers 
these software engineers design and test the software products that are or will be sold by our oem partners and resellers 
continuing to deliver new and enhanced products to meet the demands of the storage market is necessary if we are to remain competitive and to continue our growth 
we also increased our sales force and our technical support team 
an increased sales force should expand the market exposure for our products 
the expanded technical support team responds to questions and technical issues from end users of our products and from our resellers and oem partners 
providing top notch technical support to these groups enhances our ability to continue to make sales 
end users who are satisfied with our technical support are more likely to order additional products from us 
resellers and oem partners who are happy with our technical support  and whose end users are satisfied  will be more likely to recommend our current products and less likely to consider other providers for future products 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects continue to be our sales pipeline  our ability to establish and to expand relationships with key industry oems  and sales by those oems  our ability to establish and to expand relationships with resellers  and sales and re orders by those resellers  growth in deferred revenue  re orders from existing customers  sales of our new products  and the growth of the overall market for storage solutions 
our sales pipeline consists of inquiries from end users and resellers for possible purchases of our products 
our overall sales pipeline steadily increased for each quarter of compared with the corresponding quarter in oem relationships continue to be important to us for two main reasons first  sales by our oem partners contribute to our revenues 
overall  revenue from oems accounted for approximately forty eight percent of our revenues in revenues from emc rose thirty four percent from to  but the percentage of our revenues for which emc was responsible declined to twenty six percent in from twenty seven percent in sun accounted for twelve percent of our revenues in and our revenues from sun in increased by seventy six percent over the previous year 
we regard the simultaneous year over year increase in revenues from emc and year over year decline in the percentage of our revenues attributable to emc to be an indicator of the health of our business 
it shows that even as our most significant customer continues to grow the market for solutions powered by our technology  we are diversifying our product mix and our sales channels 
we anticipate that oems will again account for over forty percent of our revenues in we expect that at least two oems will account for at least ten percent of our revenues in accordingly  the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
second  having our products selected by respected  established industry leaders signals to customers  resellers and other potential oem partners that our products are quality products that add value to their enterprise 
before licensing software  oem partners typically undertake broad reviews of many of the competing software solutions available 
the choice of our products by major industry participants validates both the design and the capabilities of the products and our product roadmaps 

table of contents in  both sun and emc launched new ranges of products that incorporate our vtl technology 
several of our oem customers also indicated to us their intent to offer our singe instance repository sir de duplication technology 
in  we entered into oem agreements with other companies  including companies in asia and companies focused on the smb market 
we also renewed or extended agreements with existing oem partners 
we will continue to seek additional oem opportunities in the future 
we do everything we can to assure that our products meet the needs of our oem partners and their customers 
however  we cannot control decisions by our oem partners to change their product or marketing mix in ways that impact sales of products licensed by the oems from us 
over our history  we have entered into oem agreements with two tier oem companies  and with another significant company in the computer  networking and communications products business  only to see those oem partners change their strategies and make significant reductions in their commitments to the products that incorporate our technology 
resellers are expected to remain a significant channel for sales of our products 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these resellers typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  or combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning as promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customers are not satisfied with the level of support they are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
sales from our resellers in the united states rebounded in after falling below our expectations in increasing sales from resellers remains an area of focus for us 
steps we have taken to increase sales from resellers include the addition of sales  marketing and support personnel focused on those accounts 
we also have instituted  and we will be instituting further  support  training and incentive programs intended to increase sales by our resellers 
in  we signed agreements with new resellers worldwide 
we also terminated relationships with resellers who we believed were not properly selling our products 
we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts attributable to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfaction with our products and our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december  we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in the level of re orders from existing end users of our products is another measure of customer satisfaction 
information technology professionals will only order additional products and services for their companies if they determine that the products have reduced total cost of ownership and have provided a good return on investment 
re orders are thus an indication that our products are delivering as promised and that our support is meeting the end user s needs 
in  many end users ordered additional copies of our products  or additional products or ordered additional options 
if re orders decline  it would indicate that future sales might also decline 
as the percentage of our revenues from oems increases  our ability to gauge re orders decreases because our oem partners typically do not provide us with information identifying the end user for each order 
consolidation in the network storage market continued in the consolidation did not have a significant impact on our revenue 

table of contents the storage solutions market continued to grow in in addition to growth based on demand for storage server consolidation and replication  there was growth in backup acceleration 
given the general downturn in economic activity at the end of and the beginning of  we cannot predict whether the market for network storage solutions will continue to grow in we successfully introduced a number of products in in the fall of  falconstor released the first certified cdp virtual appliance for vmware virtual infrastructure  complementing our line of cdp products 
this product allows virtual environments to receive the same level of data protection as physical environments 
the release of this product was followed by the release of a vtl virtual appliance  demonstrating our commitment to providing data protection to all environments whether enterprise or smb  physical or virtual  local or remote 
in addition  falconstor introduced the sir de duplication technology embedded into a vtl storage appliance designed for the smb and remote office 
the vtl storage appliances integrate with vtl enterprise edition 
for the past two years  we have had initiatives in the small medium business smb and small office home office soho markets 
we have experienced some disappointments in this area  including a change in direction by a significant oem partner shortly after a product launch in  and revenues from this market segment have not been as high as we have anticipated 
we will continue to target the smb soho markets in to this end  in  we signed several new partners  such as acer  inc  v electronics  and synnex corporation  who will either oem our smb soho software or who will distribute our smb soho software either on a standalone basis or as a part of an appliance 
while we expect revenue growth in from our smb soho products  it is too early to estimate whether revenues from these markets will be significant contributors to our revenues in another area of focus in  and one that will remain an area of focus in  was the china market 
in we expanded our oem agreement with a chinese company that is a leader in telecommunications networks 
in early  we signed a joint development and research agreement with the computer network information center  chinese academy of sciences cnic  cas to establish a laboratory to develop data protection and remote disaster recovery solutions for the chinese government and enterprises with the goal of providing our data protection services throughout china 
we also entered into an oem agreement with inspur group  the largest server manufacturer and solution provider in china 
inspur will leverage the falconstor virtualtape library vtl technology to deliver proven  comprehensive  high performance vtl solutions with efficient data de duplication 
also in we entered into a joint venture agreement with the institute of computing technology of the chinese academy of science cas and others to establish a company that will research  produce  and market enterprise class storage  archiving and compliance solutions domestically and internationally 
other investors in the company  to be known as tianjin zhongke blue whale information technologies co  ltd 
blue whale  include the tianjin hi tech industry park hi tech investment management co  ltd 
blue whale will be located in the tianjin hi tech industry park 
the joint venture will develop san solutions that leverage the award winning falconstor ipstor storage infrastructure software to augment blue whale s san based clustered file system with enterprise class snapshot  replication  and de duplication services as we had anticipated  we saw the greatest increase in revenues from our virtualtape library software 
we continue to be pleased with our ability to contain the increase of expenses in our operating expenses increased from million in to million in included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we will continue to invest in infrastructure and personnel to maintain and enhance our leading edge designs and to support our customers  but we will continue to do so in a controlled  cost effective manner 
as mentioned above  our net income for was increased by a non recurring tax benefit of million included within our net tax benefit of million primarily due to our recognition of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of our cumulative positive operating results over the past three years and projections for taxable income in the future 

table of contents in addition  during  we received the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards  which reduced the amount of income taxes that we would have been required to pay 
the availability of these net operating losses are limited 
as of december   we had approximately million of us federal net operating losses available for use to offset future taxable income 
although there can be no assurance  we anticipate that our taxable income will be significantly in excess of this amount and that we will have a material tax liability in the future 
we also expect to continue to be affected by seasonality of the information technology business on a quarterly basis 
historically  information technology spending has been higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewhat slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
our quarterly results reflected this seasonality in  and we anticipate that our quarterly results for will show the effects of seasonality as well 
accounting rules relating to share based compensation expense continued to have a negative impact on our earnings in on an on going basis we weigh the impact of the expense on our consolidated financial statements against the impact of discontinuing the grant of equity based compensation to our worldwide workforce 
it continues to be our view that the opportunity to participate in the growth of our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
we will thus continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in the past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation to our employees 
for the management of our business and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results before share based compensation expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in making operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to day operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating and comparing our results across different periods 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  accounting for share based compensation and deferred income taxes 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract for nonrefundable royalty advances received from oems or a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
the software license fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms generally range from to days  depending on regional billing practices 
when a customer licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider historical return rates  specific past due accounts  analysis of our accounts receivable aging  customer payment terms  historical collections  write offs and returns  changes in customer demand and relationships  concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent level of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
with the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   the company is required to record the fair value of share based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
we estimate expected stock price volatility based primarily on a simple average historical volatility of the underlying stock over a period equal to the expected term of the option  but also consider whether other factors are present that indicate that exclusive reliance on historical volatility may not be a reliable indicator of expected volatility 
we estimate expected forfeiture rates based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and estimated future employee turnover 
we may adjust share based compensation expense on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on this review and recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate in the period in which we revised the forfeiture estimate 
with regard to our estimate of expected term  as adequate information with respect to historical share option exercise experience is not available  we primarily consider the vesting term and original contractual term of the options granted 

table of contents consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred income taxes  and report such assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods over which temporary differences reverse  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities  past and projected taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
during  as discussed above and in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements  we recorded a net deferred tax benefit of  primarily as a result of our recognition of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
as of december   we recorded million of deferred tax assets  net of million of valuation allowances 
finally  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin  on january  we are required to assess whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it meets the more likely than not threshold that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the adoption of fin did not result in any adjustment to the recognized benefits from our uncertain tax positions 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the year ended december  our operating expenses increased from million in to million in included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  included in our net income for the year ended december   was an income tax benefit of million  that primarily consisted of a reversal of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of our continuing positive operating results and financial projections 
included in our net loss for the year ended december   were i a litigation settlement charge of million relating to a contingent purchase price dispute associated with an acquisition we made in  and ii an income tax provision of million 
the growth in revenues was due to significant increases in our software license  maintenance revenues and software services and other revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily driven by increases in i demand for our network storage solution software  ii maintenance revenue from new and existing customers and iii sales from our resellers and oem partners 
revenue contribution from our oem partners increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in revenue from resellers and distributors also increased in absolute dollars for the year ended december   as compared with the same period in expenses increased in all aspects of our business to support our continued growth 
in support of our continued growth and expansion both domestically and internationally  we increased our worldwide headcount to employees as of december  as compared with employees as of december  finally  we continue to invest in our infrastructure by increasing our capital expenditures particularly with purchases of equipment for support of our existing and future product lines 

table of contents revenues year ended december  revenues software license revenue maintenance revenue software services and other revenue total revenues year over year percentage growth software license revenue maintenance revenue software services and other revenue total percentage growth software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sold through our oems  value added resellers and distributors to end users and  to a lesser extent  directly to end users 
these revenues are recognized when  among other requirements  we receive a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold and the software and permanent key codes are delivered to the customer 
we sometimes receive nonrefundable royalty advances and engineering fees from some of our oem partners 
these arrangements are evidenced by a signed customer contract  and the revenue is recognized when the software product master is delivered and accepted  and the engineering services  if any  have been performed 
software license revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software license revenue represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of broader market acceptance of our software applications and increased demand for our products from our expanding base of customers  we continue to experience increased sales from both our oem and reseller partners  which were the primary drivers of the increase in software license revenue 
software license revenue increased from both our oem partners and from our resellers 
revenue from our oem partners increased as a percentage of total revenue 
we expect our software license revenue to continue to grow in future periods 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenues are comprised of software maintenance and technical support  professional services primarily related to the implementation of our software  engineering services  and sales of computer hardware 
revenue derived from maintenance and technical support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance term 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the related services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily related to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenue from engineering services is recognized in the period in which the services are completed 
during and  we had transactions in which we purchased hardware and bundled this hardware with our software and sold this bundled solution to our customer base 
a portion of the contractual fees is recognized as revenue when the hardware or software is delivered to the customer based on the relative fair value of the delivered element s 
maintenance revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software services and other revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the major factor behind the increase in maintenance  software services and other revenue was an increase in the number of maintenance and technical support contracts  professional services contracts and bundled hardware solutions we sold 
as we are in business longer  and as we license more software to new customers and grow our installed 
table of contents customer base  we expect these revenues will continue to increase 
maintenance revenues increased primarily because i the majority of our new customers purchase maintenance and support contracts  and ii the majority of our growing existing customer base renewed their maintenance and support contracts after their initial contracts expired 
the increase in software services and other revenue was partially attributable to our hardware sales  which increased from million in to million in this increase was the result of an increase in demand from our customer base for bundled solutions  in which we purchase hardware and bundle this hardware with our software solutions 
growth in our professional services sales  which increased from million in to million in  also contributed to the increase in software services and other revenues 
this increase in professional services revenue was related to the increase in our software license customers who elected to purchase professional services 
we expect maintenance  software services and other revenues to continue to increase 
cost of revenues year ended december  cost of revenue amortization of purchased and capitalized software cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue total cost of revenues gross profit cost of revenues gross profit gross profit growth rate gross margin gross profit gross margin amortization of purchased and capitalized software to remain successful in the network storage solutions market  we must continually upgrade our software by enhancing the existing features of our products and by adding new features and products 
we often evaluate whether to develop these new offerings in house or whether we can achieve a greater return on investment by purchasing or licensing software from third parties 
based on our evaluations we have purchased or licensed software for resale since as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of purchased software licenses  net of accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively  that is being amortized over three years 
for each of the years ended december  and  the total amortization cost recorded was less than of total revenues 
we will continue to evaluate third party software licenses and may make additional purchases from time to time  which would impact the amount we record as amortization expense in future periods 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel and other costs associated with providing software implementations  technical support under maintenance contracts  training  and share based compensation expense associated with sfas no 
r 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues also includes the cost of hardware purchased that was resold 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue was primarily due to i the increased number of transactions in which we bundled purchased hardware with our software and sold the bundled solution  resulting in the increase of associated hardware costs from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   and ii the increase in personnel and related costs for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in as a result of our increased sales from maintenance and support contracts  we hired additional employees to provide technical support 
consequently  our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue will continue to grow in absolute dollars as our revenues from these services also increase 

table of contents gross profit increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  gross margins increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in our gross profit and corresponding gross margins was primarily due to our continued revenue growth and to our continued focus on our cost structure 
generally  our gross margins may fluctuate based on several factors  including i revenue growth levels  ii changes in personnel headcount and related costs  and iii our product offerings and service mix of sales 
share based compensation expense included in the cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue decreased in absolute dollars to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
share based compensation expense was equal to and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
software development costs software development costs consist primarily of personnel costs for product development personnel  share based compensation expense associated with sfas no 
r  and other related costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  quality assurance and testing 
software development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in the major contributing factors to the increase in software development costs were higher salary and personnel related costs as a result of increased headcount to enhance and test our core network storage software product and to develop new innovative features and options 
share based compensation expense included in software development costs decreased in absolute dollars to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
share based compensation expense included in software development costs was equal to and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we intend to continue recruiting and hiring product development personnel to support our software development process 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel and related costs  share based compensation expense associated with sfas no 
r  travel  public relations expense  marketing literature and promotions  commissions  trade show expenses  and the costs associated with our foreign sales offices 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to i higher commissions paid as a result of our increase in revenue  ii higher salary and personnel related costs as a result of increased sales and marketing headcount and iii higher advertising and marketing related expenses as a result of our new product offerings enhancements and related advertising and marketing of such product s 
share based compensation expense included in selling and marketing decreased in absolute dollars to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
share based compensation expense included in selling and marketing expenses was equal to and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  we continued to hire new sales and sales support personnel and to expand our worldwide presence to accommodate our anticipated revenue growth 
we anticipate that as we continue to grow sales  our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in support of such sales growth 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of general and administrative functions  share based compensation expense associated with sfas no 
r  public company related costs  directors and officers insurance  legal and professional fees  and other general corporate overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to i higher professional fees as a result various tax related activities which commenced for fiscal year  and ii increased compensation and personnel related costs as a result of increased headcount to support our general and administrative needs 
share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses was equal to and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  as our revenue and number of employees increase  our legal and professional fees and other general corporate overhead costs have increased and are likely to continue to increase 

table of contents litigation settlement charge in january  we resolved claims brought against us by two former shareholders of ip metrics  inc ip metrics 
when we purchased ip metrics in july  part of the contractual consideration was payments to be made in and to the former ip metrics shareholders based on sales of ip metrics products and or payments to be made if certain events occurred 
we made payments to all four former shareholders in and two of the former shareholders alleged that they were entitled to additional payments based on the alleged occurrence of certain contingent events and they brought an action against us 
this action was resolved in january without any admission of liability  by the payment of an additional million to the two former shareholders 
this amount was recorded as an operating expense as of december  all claims in the lawsuit have since been dismissed 
interest and other income we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in government securities and other low risk investments 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as compared with million as of december  interest and other income increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the higher average cash balance invested during as compared with resulted in increased interest income 
the interest income in both and was offset partially by other non operating expenses 
income taxes for the year ended december   our provision for income taxes included a net deferred tax benefit of million primarily related to a substantial reversal of our deferred income tax valuation allowance 
also included in our provision for income taxes were us and foreign taxes  state income taxes and us federal alternative minimum taxes 
during the year ended december   we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our prior history of cumulative pre tax losses and uncertainty about the timing of and ability to generate taxable income in the future and our assessment that the realization of the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 
during the year ended december   based upon our generation of cumulative taxable income over the past three years and our expectations for taxable income in future years  we determined that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable 
accordingly  we recognized a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of december   our deferred tax asset  net of a valuation allowance was million 
we have approximately an additional million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards relate to excess compensation deductions from exercises of stock options and the resulting benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
for the year ended december   our provision for income taxes consisted of us taxes  foreign taxes  us federal alternative minimum taxes and state minimum taxes that were expected to be incurred primarily as a result of the limitations on our ability to utilize net operating losses under the alternative minimum tax system and the non deductibility of certain share based compensation expense for income tax purposes that had been recognized for financial statement purposes and foreign taxes

maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software services and other revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the major factor behind the increase in maintenance revenue was an increase in the number of maintenance and technical support contracts we sold 
as a result of being in business longer  and as we license more software  we continue to experience increases in maintenance revenues 
the majority of our new customers purchase maintenance and support and most customers renew their maintenance and support after their initial contracts expire 
the increase in software services and other revenue was partially attributable to our hardware sales  which increased from million in to million in this increase was the result of an increase in demand from our customers for bundled solutions 
growth in our professional services sales  which increased from million in to million in  also contributed to the increase in software services and other revenues 
this increase in professional services revenue was related to the increase in our software license customers who elected to purchase professional services

see item a of part i  risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  deferred income taxes and accounting for share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract for nonrefundable royalty advances received from oems or a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold for each software license resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
the software license fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range from to days  depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of our customers extended payment terms 
when a customer licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value based on the contractual maintenance renewal rate 
accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we i consider historical return rates  ii specific past due accounts  iii analysis of our accounts receivable aging  iv customer payment terms  v historical collections  write offs and returns  vi changes in customer demand and relationships  and vii concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent level of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
deferred income taxes 
consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred income taxes  and report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable  and we have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  the effect of temporary differences  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities  past and projected taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
during the year ended december   based on positive evidence from our earnings trends  we recognized a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of december   our deferred tax asset  net of a valuation allowance  was million 
as of december   we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our prior history of pre tax losses and uncertainty about the timing of and ability to generate taxable income in the future and our assessment that the realization of the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 

table of contents accounting for share based payments 
as discussed further in note share based payment arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share based compensation expense 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of share based compensation expense reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors 
additionally  we estimate forfeiture rates based primarily upon historical experiences  adjusted when appropriate for known events or expected trends 
we may adjust share based compensation expense on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of these events and trends  and recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization after january  in the period in which we revised the forfeiture estimate 
if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the share based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december  and could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions or estimates are used in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future

sfas no 
also stipulates that  as a market based measurement  fair value should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
adoption was originally required as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  the fasb subsequently deferred the adoption of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to the fiscal year beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the provisions of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks 
our return on our investments in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities which aggregated to million as of december   is subject to interest rate risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to manage the market risk of our marketable securities 
if interest rates were to change by from the levels at december   the effect on our financial results would be insignificant foreign currency risk 
we have several offices outside the united states 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have not been material since our inception 
if foreign currency exchange rates were to change by from the levels at december   the effect on our other comprehensive income would be insignificant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure
