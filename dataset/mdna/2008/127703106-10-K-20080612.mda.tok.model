item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand cagle s inc  our operations and our present business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes notes 
general we are in a highly stratified industry with the top five producers accounting for percent of poultry production in this country and the next fifteen accounting for percent 
our company currently produces ready to cook product of million pounds per week  placing it in the top twenty integrated broiler companies ranked by ready to cook pounds 
cagle s produces a product which differentiates itself from the average broiler company  as industry live weights approach pounds per head  and our birds weigh approximately pounds per head 
while this difference impacts the fixed cost per unit of our operations  we believe it serves our company by allowing us to compete for a value added customer profile namely the fast food  institutional  and deli markets 
we believe this is a market segment that we excel in and can provide our customers with distinctive  quality product to fit their needs at margins necessary to offset the higher cost per unit brought about by the smaller live weight 
for the fiscal year ending the company reported a loss of million or per diluted share compared to a profit of 
million or per diluted share for fiscal net sales for fiscal were million as compared to for fiscal poultry sales pounds for the year increased coupled with an average price per pound increase of when compared to fiscal fiscal market prices compared to fiscal for boneless breast  leg quarters  wings  and boneless thighs were   respectively 
as a company we continue to focus on niche markets where we can react to our customer needs in a quick and efficient manner 
given our bird size and production facilities we continue to exploit our expertise in the deli fast food arena 
cost of production for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal an increase of 
feed prices which account for approximately of our total cost increased for the year reflected as a increase in cost of sales 
in general a 
per bushel price change in corn or a per ton price change in soybean meal impacts our cost of sales by million dollars per year 
our workforce is made up of  dedicated employees who are encouraged to freely share suggestions to improve all phases of our operations 
we stress safety in our operations as reflected by current results of million man hours without a lost time accident in our alabama facility and over million miles driven by our transportation group without a preventable dot chargeable accident 
our injury and illness rates are consistently to below industry averages 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year as compared to million in fiscal representing an increase of 
the increase is the result of increased energy costs  higher professional fees incurred in complying with section a of the sarbanes oxley act of and outside storage costs experienced as one of our freezers was being reworked 
interest expense of million reflects a decline in fiscal as a result of lower debt obligations 
financially our company remains strong 
at the end of our fiscal year our stockholder s equity was million with a net working capital of million 
total debt of million reflected an increase of or million this fiscal year to support higher inventory values brought about by increased feed ingredient costs 
our company and the protein industry in general will continue to be challenged to increase market prices at a pace equal to  or greater than  our cost of feed and as a result we no longer offer flat price sales contracts that can not be price protected for grain cost increases 
we continue to explore capital opportunities that will improve operational efficiencies and product quality to insure our ability to provide excellent service to our customers at a competitive price 
it is our expectation that capital expenditures will be funded by cash on hand and cash generated through operations 
year compared to the company had available million unused in established lines of credit as of march  and million unused in availability as of march  interest expense was reduced in by thousand  a reduction  as compared to the same period a year ago 
poultry pounds produced for the were greater than  pounds marketed increased by and sales revenue increased 
cost of sales increased as compared to  after adjusting for an asset valuation adjustment to an inactive facility  cost of sales increased 
selling  general and administrative costs compared to increased by 
this increase is the result of increased energy costs  higher professional fees incurred in complying with section a of the sarbanes oxley act of and outside storage costs experienced as one of our freezers was being reworked 
year compared to the company had available million unused in established lines of credit as of march  and million unused in availability as of april  interest expense was reduced in by thousand  a reduction  as compared to the same period a year ago 
poultry sales for the year were basically unchanged correlated to a reduction in pounds marketed of and an increase in average market price of 
cost of sales increased as compared to  due to a million asset valuation adjustment to an inactive facility noted in the company s second quarter q 
when adjusted for the inactive facility charge  cost of sales remained relatively flat with an increase of versus the same period last year 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year as compared to million in fiscal representing an increase of 
of the increase experienced in fiscal bad debt expense was responsible for  salaries and benefits for and a decrease of fees earned thorough outside accounting services had an impact of 
the company s share of earnings in the unconsolidated affiliate decreased by due to the sale of the affiliate on august  income taxes were adjusted as a result of the sale of the unconsolidated affiliate 
this transaction changed the income tax position of the company 
as a result of the loss of the continuing income from the subsidiary  certain recoverable state tax assets which could expire before being realized were adjusted 
year compared to the company had available million unused in established lines of credit as of april  versus million unused in availability as of april  interest expense was reduced in by thousand  a reduction  as compared to the same period a year ago 
revenues declined by as compared to this decrease can be attributed to two factors 
a decrease in our average selling price of for the twelve months of  quoted market prices declined approximately for the same period  and a increase in production tonnage for compared to this increase was impacted by a decrease in production tonnage for the fourth quarter of gross margins were for as compared to for fiscal gross margins were impacted by settlements received by the company as a result of litigation involving manufacturers of vitamins utilized in the feeding of our live birds in the amount of thousand 
when this settlement is removed  the gross margin was for the deterioration from to is due primarily to market price pressures caused by overproduction by the industry and the impact of avian influenza on export markets 
this caused the lowest breast market pricing in recent history and created an abundance of freezer stocks  at the same time energy costs experienced recent historical highs 
freight costs also rose dramatically toward the end of the year 
the company has increased the capacity of its hatchery  through an addition to the existing building 
during the year ended april   thousand  funded through cash flow  was expended on this construction 
this addition increased our hatchery capacity by 
finished feed costs averaged lower than the previous year 
selling and delivery expenses increased by  as compared to this reflects increases in fuel costs  payroll costs  and commission expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  as compared to this decrease reflects reductions in payroll costs and professional expenses 
other general expense is primarily from the gain on sale of fixed assets and increased by as compared to interest expense for was lower than for  resulting from lower debt levels throughout the year 
other income expense is primarily from interest earned on excess cash  and increased by as compared to the company s share of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by as compared to  due to the affiliates decreases in volumes processed 
the company records deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts 
effective in fiscal  the revenue act of rescinded the cash basis method of accounting for tax purposes previously used for the company s farming operations 
previously recorded income tax liabilities of million were indefinitely deferred 
under tax laws enacted in  such liabilities are required to be amortized into taxable income over a year period 
the company has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of million  which are available to reduce income taxes through realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period 
due to the significant amount of income that would be needed to fully utilize the credits available  the company has recorded a valuation allowance for a significant portion of the deferred tax asset associated with the tax credit carryforwards 
financial condition liquidity analysis of cash flows we expect that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations  to make all payments of principal and interest when due  and to fund capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
for the year ended march   the company used cash in its operating activities of million  due primarily to the increase in inventories  which resulted from increases in grain costs 
cash was used in investing activities  in the amount of million  to purchase property  plant and equipment 
cash was provided by financing activities by drawing on lines of credit in the amount of million 
for the year ended march   the company used cash in its operating activities of million  due primarily to the operating loss during the year 
cash was provided from investing activities  in the amount of million  due primarily from the cash received from the sale of an affiliate 
cash flow used in financing activities of million reflects the retirement of long term debt 
for the year ended april   the company provided cash from operating activities of million  due primarily to a reduction in accounts payables and to non cash charges of depreciation and amortization 
cash used in investing activities of million is primarily due to the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
cash flow used in financing activities of 
million reflects the retirement of long term debt 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations contractual obligations at march  were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon product shipment and transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of any discounts  allowances or promotions 
estimates for any special pricing arrangements  promotions or other volume based incentives are recorded upon shipment of the product in accordance with the terms of the promotion  allowance or pricing arrangements 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts reflecting estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
due to the nature of the industry and the short term nature of these accounts  there have not been material revisions in these estimates of management 
inventories 
live bird and hatching egg inventories are stated at cost and breeder hens are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  consistent with industry standards 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over the productive lives using the unit of production method 
finished poultry products  feed  and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we record valuations and adjustments for our inventories and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting the inventories obsolescence  including significantly aged products  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts  which are carried in inventories at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected at cost or market  whichever is lower 
for inventory valuation purposes  costs include live production costs principally feed  chick cost  medications and other raw materials  labor and production overhead 
not all broilers and breeders survive to maturity or disposition  normal losses are not expensed directly because total costs of the project are assigned to the survivors 
the company would record adjustments to reduce the values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market values if market prices for poultry or feed grains moved substantially lower  this would increase our cost of sales 
the company has not experienced material revisions to its inventory costs 
property  plant and equipment 
the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i future cash flows estimates expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in the company s operations  and estimated salvage values  and ii estimated fair market value of the assets 
contingent liabilities 
the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
accrued self insurance 
insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits is estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
certain categories of claim liabilities are actuarially determined 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet  primarily operating loss carry forwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on april  fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax provision is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
the company had no significant unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption or at march  accordingly  the company does not have any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
however  if interest or penalties were to be incurred related to uncertain tax positions  such amounts would be recognized in income tax expense 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this statement amends arb no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
before this statement was issued  limited guidance existed for reporting noncontrolling interests 
as a result  considerable diversity in practice existed 
so called minority interests were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities or in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity 
this statement improves comparability by eliminating that diversity 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  that is  january   for entities with calendar year ends 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the company s management does not anticipate that this pronouncement will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is intended to improve financial reporting transparency regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities by providing investors with a better understanding of their effects on financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas no 
applies to all entities and is effective for consolidated financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  with early adoption encouraged 
the company s management does not anticipate that this pronouncement will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk factors industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken 
profitability in the chicken industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of chicken and feed ingredients  which are determined by supply and demand factors  which result in cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens  and deliver products 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past 
we periodically seek  to the extent available  to enter into advance purchase commitments for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed costs 
the use of such instruments may not be successful 
leverage 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and expect to continue to have  an amount of indebtedness 
our indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds  and failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are beyond our control 
additional borrowings available 
despite our indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness in the future 
contamination of products 
if our products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
livestock and poultry disease 
outbreaks of livestock diseases  in general  and poultry disease  in particular  can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreak of disease  could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  to or from our suppliers  facilities  or customers  or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation  and prospects 
insurance 
we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage  and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited  and potentially inadequate 
market sensitive derivatives and financial instruments commodity futures and swap contracts are used to manage cost exposures on certain raw material purchases resulting in relatively stable costs for these commodities 
the company does not consider commodity price risk to be material to consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effect of change in fair value in millions grain significant competition 
competition in the chicken industry with other vertically integrated poultry companies could adversely affect our business 
government regulation 
regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken industry is subject to federal  state  and local governmental regulation  including health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations  and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future
