kellogg company is the world s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods  including cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit snacks  frozen waffles  and veggie foods 
kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 
we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments  comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
beginning in  the asia pacific segment includes south africa  which was formerly a part of europe 
prior years were restated for comparison purposes 
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets 
during the periods presented these targets were low single digit for internal net sales  low to mid single digit for internal operating profit  and high single digit for net earnings per share

in combination with an attractive dividend yield  we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders 
we plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business  expanding our snacks business  and pursuing selected growth opportunities 
we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profit rich  sustainable sales growth  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital 
we believe our steady earnings growth  strong cash flow  and continued investment during a multi year period of significant commodity and energy driven cost inflation demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model

internal sales of our asia pacific operating segment which represents approximately of our consolidated results were approximately even with the prior year  as solid growth in asian markets was offset by weak performance in our australian business 
consolidated operating profit for grew  with internal operating profit up versus for  europe contributed a strong internal growth rate  driven by increased sales and stronger gross margins  as well as lower up front costs 
despite a strong sales performance  operating profit in our north american segment was dampened by continued commodity cost pressures and significantly higher up front costs associated with cost reduction initiatives  as more fully discussed on page as previously predicted  our latin america and asia pacific operating segments suffered operating profit declines  primarily driven by lower gross margins due to increased commodity costs  as well as the previously mentioned weak performance in our australian business 
our current year operating profit growth was also affected by significant cost pressures as discussed in the margin performance section beginning on page expenditures for brand building activities increased at a mid single digit rate  this rate of growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional campaigns

the significant growth achieved by our north america snacks business represented nearly one half of the total dollar increase in consolidated internal net sales for the growth in north america retail cereal sales was on top of growth in and represented the th consecutive year in which we ve increased our dollar share of category sales 
although north america consumer retail cereal consumption remained steady throughout  our shipment revenues declined in the fourth quarter of by approximately versus the prior year period 
we believe this decline was largely attributable to year end retail trade inventory adjustments  which brought inventories in line with year end levels after several successive quarters of slight inclines 
our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately or on an internal basis  with leading dollar contributions

consolidated operating profit for grew  with internal operating profit up versus as discussed on page  our measure of internal operating profit growth is consistent with our measure of internal sales growth  except that during  internal operating profit growth also excluded the impact of incremental stock compensation expense associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we used this non gaap financial measure during our first year of adopting this fasb standard in order to assist management and investors in assessing the company s financial operating performance against comparative periods  which did not include stock option related compensation expense 
accordingly  corporate selling  general  and administrative sga expense was higher and operating profit was lower by million for  reducing consolidated operating profit growth by approximately four percentage points 
refer to the section beginning on page entitled stock compensation for further information on the company s adoption of sfas no

although total up front costs of million were not significantly changed from the amount of million  a year over year shift in operating segment allocation of such costs affected relative segment performance 
the versus change in project cost allocation was a million decline in north america improving segment operating profit performance by approximately and a million increase in europe reducing segment operating profit performance by approximately 
for  operating profit growth was affected by significant cost pressures as discussed in the margin performance section 
expenditures for brand building activities increased at a low single digit rate  this rate of growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional campaigns 
within our total brand building metric  advertising expenditures grew at a high single digit rate for margin performance margin performance is presented in the following table 
change vs 
prior year pts 
gross margin a sga b operating margin a gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold 
b selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales 
we strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in brand building and innovation expenditures 
our strategy for increasing our gross profit is to manage external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements  productivity savings  and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging 
for  our gross profit was up over  an increase of million 
our gross margin performance for and reflects the impact of significant fuel  energy  and commodity price inflation experienced throughout most of that time  as well as increased employee benefit costs in in the aggregate  these input cost pressures reduced our consolidated gross margin by approximately basis points for and basis points in for  our gross margin performance was also unfavorably impacted by incremental logistics and innovation start up costs related to the significant sales growth within our north america operating segment 
the majority of the inflationary pressure during and was commodity and energy driven 
total active and retired employee benefits expense was approximately million in versus million in and million in for  the combined effect of favorable trust asset performance in prior years and rising discount rates is expected to have a moderating effect on underlying benefit cost inflation 
as a result  we expect benefits expense to be approximately lower than for  we expect inflationary trends to accelerate  with net input cost fuel  energy  commodity  and benefits pressures forecasted to exceed realized savings 
as compared to results  we currently expect incremental cost inflation  primarily associated with the prices of our ingredient purchases to be greater than 
per share 
accordingly  we believe our consolidated gross margin could decline by approximately basis points which includes an approximately basis point reduction related to our acquisitions and an approximately basis point 
table of contents reduction due to higher up front costs expected in cost of goods sold 
in addition to external cost pressures  our discretionary investment in cost reduction initiatives refer to following section has created variability in our gross margin performance during the periods presented 
although total annual program related charges were relatively steady over the past several years  the amount recorded in cost of goods sold varied by year in millions   additionally  cost of goods sold for includes a charge of approximately million  related to a lump sum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our us cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the company covering the four year period ended october for both our sga and operating margin were affected by our fiscal adoption of sfas no 
r 
during  we reported incremental stock compensation expense of million which increased our sga and reduced our operating margin by approximately basis points in refer to the section beginning on page entitled stock compensation for further information on this subject 
for  our sga was negatively impacted by the reorganization of our direct store door delivery dsd operations 
total program costs of million were recorded in sga expense  as discussed further in the exit or disposal plans section 
exit or disposal plans we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in meeting long term growth targets 
initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion 
each cost reduction initiative is normally one to three years in duration 
upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs  the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation  which is then reinvested in the business 
certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal plans for which material charges will be incurred 
we include these charges in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the net sales and operating profit section beginning on page in  we commenced a multi year european manufacturing optimization plan to improve utilization of our facility in manchester  england and to better align production in europe 
based on forecasted foreign exchange rates  the company currently expects to incur approximately million in total up front costs  including million recorded in  and million recorded in  with the remainder to be incurred in the cost is comprised of approximately cash expenditures and non cash asset write offs 
the cash portion of the total up front costs results principally from management s plan to eliminate approximately hourly and salaried positions from the manchester facility by the end of through voluntary early retirement and severance programs 
the pension trust funding requirements of these early retirements are expected to exceed the recognized benefit expense impact by approximately million  most of this incremental funding occurred in during the program  certain manufacturing equipment will also be removed from service 
all of the costs for the european manufacturing optimization plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the company s european operating segment

commencement of this plan follows consultation with union representatives at the bremen facility regarding the elimination of approximately employee positions 
this reorganization plan is specifically intended to improve manufacturing and distribution efficiency across our continental european operations  and is expected to be completed by mid based on forecasted foreign exchange rates  we expect to incur approximately million of total project costs  comprised of approximately asset write offs and employee separation benefits and other cash costs 
the company recorded million of costs in  with the remaining to be incurred in

this dsd reorganization plan is intended to integrate the company s southeastern sales and distribution regions with the rest of its us direct store door operations  resulting in greater efficiency across the nationwide network 
in preparation for this initiative  in june  the company began to extend offers to exit approximately distribution route franchise agreements with independent contractors  which were substantially accepted as of july the plan resulted in the involuntary termination or relocation of approximately employee positions 
total project costs incurred were million  principally consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise settlements and to a lesser extent  for employee separation  relocation  and reorganization 
this initiative was substantially complete by the end of all of the costs for the us dsd reorganization plan have been recorded in selling  general  and administrative expense within the company s north america operating segment

during  we implemented several short term initiatives to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our us cereal manufacturing network and streamlined our sales distribution system in a latin american market 
in  we undertook an initiative to consolidate us snacks bakery capacity  resulting in the closure and sale of two facilities by mid these initiatives were substantially complete at december  details of each initiative are described in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
for  the company recorded total program related charges of approximately million  comprised of million of asset write offs  million for severance and other exit costs including route franchise settlements  million for other cash expenditures  and million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability 
approximately million of the total charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the europe operating segment results  with approximately million recorded in sga expense within the north america operating results

the company s operating segments were impacted as follows in millions north america  europe for  total program related charges were approximately million  comprised of million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability  million of asset write offs  million in severance and other exit costs  and million for other cash expenditures 
all of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within our north america operating segment 

table of contents for the periods presented  cash requirements to implement these programs approximated the exit costs and other cash charges incurred in each year  except for approximately million of incremental pension trust funding that occurred in in connection with the european manufacturing optimization plan 
at december   the company s remaining cash commitments to complete the executed programs were comprised of exit cost reserves of million expected to be paid out in  and estimated multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities of million  which will not be finally determined until and once determined  are payable to the pension fund over a year maximum period 
we expect these cash requirements to be funded by operating cash flow 
our earnings target includes total projected charges related to in progress and potential cost reduction initiatives of approximately million or 
per share 
approximately one third of this total is allocated to the aforementioned european projects 
however  the specific cash versus non cash mix or cost of goods sold versus sga expense impact of the remainder has not yet been determined 
other potential initiatives to be commenced in are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as we commit to these discretionary investments 
interest expense as illustrated in the following table  annual interest expense for the period has been relatively steady  which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time 
interest income recorded in other income has trended upward from approximately million in to million in  resulting in net interest expense of approximately million for we currently expect that our net interest expense will be comparable to the amount 
change vs 
prior year dollars in millions reported interest expense a amounts capitalized gross interest expense a reported interest expense for and includes charges of approximately and respectively related to the early redemption of long term debt 
other income expense  net other income expense  net includes non operating items such as interest income  charitable donations  and gains and losses related to foreign exchange and commodity derivatives 
other income expense  net for the periods presented was in millions   
the variability in other income expense  net  among years reflects the timing of certain significant charges explained in the following paragraph 
other expense includes charges for contributions to the kellogg s corporate citizenship fund  a private trust established for charitable giving  as follows in millions   other expense for also includes a charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to estimated selling value 
this facility was sold in august income taxes our long term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 
in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of  we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our target 
excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of repatriating foreign earnings  our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for was approximately  with the rate for and at approximately 
we currently expect our sustainable rate to be approximately  in line with our objective 
our reported rates of approximately for and for were lower than the sustainable rate due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements  international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate changes 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
for  we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 
this could be impacted however  if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows  supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
this cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
during  we believe our company s financial strength has been especially evident in the face of the recent us sub prime mortgage market crisis and its pervasive effect on general credit market liquidity 
for the year  we continued to have access to the us commercial paper market without significant increase in our effective short term borrowing rate  and our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings have not been affected 
our annual interest expense for the period has been relatively steady  which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time 
we have not had any significant new borrowings under our euro or canadian commercial paper programs since june  which has limited our exposure to non us credit market illiquidity during this turbulent period 
operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding is relatively short  equating to approximately days for the trailing day period ended december   an improvement to the comparable prior year period which was days 
as a result  our operating cash flow should generally reflect our net earnings performance over time  although  as illustrated in the following schedule  specific results for any particular year may be significantly affected by the level of benefit plan contributions  working capital movements operating assets and liabilities and other factors 
dollars in millions operating activities net earnings year over year change items in net earnings not requiring providing cash depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes other a net earnings after non cash items year over year change pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions changes in operating assets and liabilities core working capital b other working capital total net cash provided by operating activities year over year change a consists principally of non cash expense accruals for employee compensation and benefit obligations 
b inventory and trade receivables less trade payables 
our net cash provided by operating activities for was million higher than the comparable period of  due primarily to growth in cash basis earnings and favorable total working capital performance 
operating cash flow for was approximately million higher than  due primarily to lower benefit plan contributions  partially offset by unfavorable working capital movements 
the decline in benefit plan contributions for and  as compared to  reflects the improved funded position of our major benefit plans that was achieved through a significant amount of funding in the period 
on august   the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states 
the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax qualified plans 
most of these provisions are first applicable to our us defined benefit pension plans in on a phased in basis 
the ppa will ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our us plans 
however  due to our historical funding practices  we currently believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under the new ppa requirements until after accordingly  we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the next several years  with total us and foreign plan contributions currently estimated at approximately million 
actual contributions could exceed our current projections  as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  renewals of union contracts  or 
table of contents higher than expected health care claims cost experience 
additionally  our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
as compared to  the favorable movement in core working capital during was related principally to higher trade payables  which are due in part  to increased payment terms in international locations 
during  our trade payables balance increased by almost from year end in contrast  our december  trade payables balance was within of the balance at year end for the trailing fifty two weeks ended december   core working capital was of net sales  consistent with year end  as compared to as of year end we have been able to maintain this level through the timely collection of accounts receivable and extension of terms on trade payables  offset by slightly higher inventory levels 
in comparison to  the unfavorable movement in core working capital during was related to trade payables performance and higher inventory balances 
the higher inventory balance was principally related to higher commodity prices for our raw material and packaging inventories and to a lesser extent  the overall increase in the average number of weeks of inventory on hand 
our consolidated inventory balances were unfavorably affected by us capacity limitations during as presented in the table on page  other working capital was a use of cash in versus a source of cash in the difference relates to year over year increase in the amount of income tax payments 
the favorable movement in other working capital in as compared to was attributable to several factors including lower debt related currency swap payments in as well as business related growth in accrued compensation and promotional liabilities 
investing activities our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchase 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change our cash flow as defined performance during the periods presented reflects increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our company s strong sales growth over the past several years 
this increased capital spending represented of net sales in and of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in for  we currently expect property expenditures to remain at approximately of net sales  which is consistent with our long term target for capital spending 
this forecast includes expenditures associated with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in kutno  poland and expansion of our global research center in battle creek  michigan which together represents approximately of our capital plan 
the facility in poland will help us meet consumer demand for our ready to eat cereals in the emerging central and eastern european markets 
the expansion of the w 
k 
kellogg institute for food and nutrition research reflects our commitment to research and innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business 
for  we are expecting cash flow to be broadly in line with our results 
we expect to achieve our target principally through operating profit growth  and prudent management of our working capital 
as discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements  our property additions for include approximately million for the purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in chicago  illinois 
as discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements  in order to support the continued growth of our north america operating segment  the company completed two separate business acquisitions in late for a total of approximately million in cash  including related transaction costs 
on november   a subsidiary of the company acquired of the equity interests in bear naked  inc  a leading seller of premium branded natural granola products 
on november   the company acquired certain assets and liabilities of the wholesome hearty foods company  a us manufacturer of veggie foods marketed under the gardenburger brand 

table of contents to expand the company s presence in eastern europe  on january   subsidiaries of the company acquired substantially all of the equity interests in ojsc kreker doing business as united bakers and consolidated subsidiaries for approximately million in cash  including transaction fees incurred to date  and million in assumed debt 
the company expects to acquire the remaining minority interests through tender offers initiated during united bakers is a leading producer of cereal  cookie  and cracker products in russia  with  employees  six manufacturing facilities  and a broad distribution network 
the business realized approximately million of revenues in due to various factors including accounting principle conformity  these revenues are not necessarily indicative of the pro forma incremental effect on the company s consolidated net sales  assuming this business combination had been completed at the beginning of the purchase agreement between the company and the seller provides for the payment of a currently undeterminable amount of contingent consideration at the end of three years  provided certain financial performance metrics are achieved 
such payment would be recognized as additional purchase price when the contingency is resolved 
as part of the aforementioned initial purchase price for this acquisition  the company incurred approximately million in transaction fees and cash advances during  which we classified as business acquisition related investing cash outflows in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  in order to support the continued growth of our north american fruit snacks business  we completed two separate business acquisitions during for a total of approximately million in cash  including related transaction costs 
in june  we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from kraft foods inc the facility is located in chicago  illinois and employs approximately active hourly and salaried employees 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a washington state based manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks 
financing activities for  our board of directors authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to million  which we spent to repurchase approximately million shares 
pursuant to similar board authorizations applicable to those years  we paid million in to repurchase approximately million shares  and million in to repurchase approximately million shares 
the activity consisted principally of a february private transaction with the w 
k 
kellogg foundation trust the trust to repurchase approximately million shares for million 
the activity consisted principally of a november private transaction with the trust to repurchase approximately million shares for million 
for  our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million 
our company paid dividends to shareholders in in the amount of per common share 
this represented a increase from the previous level of per common share paid in the increase was due to the board s authorization to pay quarterly dividends in the amount of 
per common share beginning in september  this increase is consistent with our current plan to maintain our dividend pay out ratio between and of reported net earnings 
in december  the company issued million of five year fixed rate us dollar notes  using the proceeds from these notes to replace a portion of our us commercial paper 
these notes were issued under an existing shelf registration statement 
the effective interest rate on these notes  reflecting issuance discount and swap settlement  is 
the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and our restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease back transactions as well as a change in control provision 
also in december  we redeemed approximately million of notes issued in march   otherwise due in during november  subsidiaries of the company issued approximately million of foreign currency denominated debt in offerings outside of the united states  consisting of euro million of floating rate notes due the euro notes and approximately c million of canadian commercial paper 
these debt issuances were guaranteed by the company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the american jobs creation act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company  as well as for general corporate purposes 
to utilize excess cash and reduce financing costs  on february   we redeemed the euro notes otherwise due may  for million 
to partially refinance this redemption  we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million or its equivalent in alternative currencies 
the notes may have maturities ranging up to days and are senior unsecured obligations of the applicable issuer  with subsidiary issuances guaranteed by the company 
in connection with these financing activities  we increased our short term lines of credit from billion at december  to approximately billion at december  this increase was 
table of contents achieved via a million unsecured day credit agreement effective january  the day agreement contains customary covenants  warranties  and restrictions similar to those applicable to our existing billion five year credit agreement  which expires in our credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper back up  although we do not currently anticipate any draw down of the facilities 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt issuances and credit facilities 
the million credit agreement expired at the end of january  and the company did not renew it 
at december   our total debt was approximately billion  approximately even with the balance at year end during  we reduced the company s common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately  and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 
similarly  during  we further reduced our common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 
primarily due to the prioritization of these uses of cash flow  the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity  as well as pursue selective acquisition opportunities  we did not reduce our total debt balance during the past two years  but remain committed to net debt reduction total debt less cash over the long term 
we currently expect the total debt balance at year end to be slightly higher than the year end level 
although we presently observe a general recovery of liquidity within the commercial paper market and improved pricing in the corporate bond market  we cannot reasonably predict the extent and duration of the continuing sub prime mortgage market crisis  the economic environment  nor their potential indirect effect on our sector 
however  we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions  through our strong cash flow  our program of issuing short term debt  and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis 
our significant long term debt issues do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in the company s credit ratings could limit our access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our aforementioned credit facilities 
in addition  assuming continuation of the present market conditions  we believe it would be possible to term out certain short term maturities or obtain additional credit facilities such that the company could further extend its ability to meet its long term borrowing obligations through off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december  the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements were limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately million and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of dsd route franchises up to million 
during  we terminated the operating lease and purchased the facility 
see note within the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through as follows  critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
 which affects our process for estimating tax benefits and liabilities  as further discussed in the income taxes section beginning on page the initial application of fin no 
resulted in a net decrease to accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately million  with an offsetting increase to retained earnings 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on fin no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements in order to establish a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is intended to result in increased consistency and comparability in fair value measurements 
sfas no 
also expands disclosures about fair value measurements  with the intention of improving the quality of information provided to users of financial statements 
the standard applies whenever other authoritative literature requires or permits certain assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value 
sfas no 
was originally effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted 
in early  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas  which delays by one year  the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the delay pertains to items including  but not limited to  non financial assets and non financial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination  reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of evaluating goodwill for impairment under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment under sfas no 
 and long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we plan to adopt the portion of sfas no 
that has not been delayed by fsp fas as of the beginning of our fiscal year  and plan to adopt the balance of its provisions as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
for the company  balance sheet items carried at fair value on a recurring basis to which sfas no 
applies in consist primarily of derivative financial instruments 
balance sheet items carried at fair value on a non recurring basis to which sfas no 
will apply in consist of assets held for sale and exit liabilities 
relevant to the intangibles section beginning on page  we also use fair value concepts to test various long lived assets for impairment and to initially measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 
we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
in to have a material effect on the measurement of the company s financial 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact the standard will have on the determination of fair value related to non financial assets and non financial liabilities in post years 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised business combinations and sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  these new standards represent the completion of the fasb s first major joint project with the international accounting standards board iasb and are intended to improve  simplify  and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests formerly minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt these standards at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the effect of adoption will generally be prospectively applied to transactions completed after the end of our fiscal year  although the new presentation and disclosure requirements for pre existing noncontrolling interests will be retrospectively applied to all prior period financial information presented 
sfas no 
r retains the underlying fair value concepts of its predecessor sfas no 
 but changes the method for applying the acquisition method in a number of significant respects including the requirement to expense transaction fees and expected restructuring costs as incurred  rather than including these amounts in the allocated purchase price  the requirement to recognize the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date  rather than the expected amount when the contingency is resolved  the requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired in process research and development assets at the acquisition date  rather than immediately expensing  and the requirement to recognize a gain in relation to a bargain purchase price  rather than reducing the allocated basis of long lived assets 
because this standard is generally applied prospectively  the effect of adoption on our financial statements will depend primarily on specific transactions  if any  completed after we are currently evaluating the effects that sfas no 
r is likely to have on potential post transactions 
under sfas no 
 consolidated financial statements will be presented as if the parent company investors controlling interests and other minority investors noncontrolling interests in partially owned subsidiaries have similar economic interests in a single entity 
as a result  the investment in the noncontrolling interest  previously recorded on the balance sheet between liabilities and equity the mezzanine  will be reported as equity in the parent company s consolidated financial statements  subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
furthermore  consolidated financial statements will include of a controlled subsidiary s earnings  rather than only the parent company s share 
lastly  transactions between the parent company and noncontrolling interests will be reported in equity as transactions between shareholders  provided these transactions do not create a change in control 
previously  acquisitions of additional interests in a controlled subsidiary generally resulted in remeasurement of assets and liabilities acquired  dispositions of interests generally resulted in a gain or loss 
management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on the company s financial statements 
presently  there are no significant noncontrolling interests in any of the company s consolidated subsidiaries 
therefore  we currently believe that the impact of sfas no 
 if any  will primarily depend on the materiality of noncontrolling interests arising in future transactions  including those entered into during  to which the financial statement presentation and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
will apply 
our critical accounting estimates  which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements  are discussed in the following sections on pages promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve in store displays and events  feature price discounts on our products  consumer coupons  contests  and loyalty programs  and similar activities 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than 

of our company s net sales 
however  as our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented nearly of net sales  the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
intangibles we follow sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in evaluating impairment of intangibles 
we perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment testing first 
table of contents requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction 
similarly  impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we also follow sfas no 
in evaluating the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized  an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
at december   intangible assets  net  were billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company 
within this total  approximately billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived  comprised principally of keebler trademarks 
while we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our north american snacks business or the weighted average cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses and or amortization expense 
stock compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment  which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r as of the beginning of our fiscal year  using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  prior years were not restated 
with the adoption of this pronouncement  stock based compensation represents a critical accounting policy of the company  which is further described in note within notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  our adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in an increase in the company s corporate sga expense and a corresponding reduction to earnings and net earnings per share  due primarily to the recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants 
no such expense was recognized under our previous accounting method in pre periods  however we were required to disclose pro forma results under the alternative fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
using reported results for and pro forma results for  the comparable impact of stock compensation expense is presented in the following table stock based compensation expense diluted eps millions  except per share data pre tax net of tax impact as reported comparable sfas no 
r adoption impact as reported total as reported comparable pro forma incremental pro forma total accounting for stock compensation under sfas no 
r represents a critical accounting estimate  which requires significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements 
due to the need to determine the grant date fair value of equity instruments that have not yet been awarded  the actual impact on future results will depend  in part  on actual awards during any reporting period and various market factors that affect the fair value of those awards 
additionally  while the timing and volume of grants associated with a particular year s long term incentive compensation are within our control  the timing and volume of reload option grants are not 
reload options are awarded to eligible employees and directors to replace previously owned company stock used by those individuals to pay the exercise price  including related employment taxes  of vested pre option awards containing this accelerated ownership feature 
under sfas no 
r  these reload options result in additional compensation expense in the year of grant and for and  represented approximately one third of the company s total stock option expense 

table of contents the company has not granted options containing an accelerated ownership feature since  however  the potential requirement to award reload options over the contractual year term of the original grants could continue to significantly impact the amount of our stock based compensation expense for a number of years 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using a lattice based option valuation model for annual grants and a black scholes model for reload grants 
these models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility  employee exercise behavior  and dividend yield 
our methods for selecting these valuation assumptions are explained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
in particular  our estimate of stock price volatility is based principally on historical volatility of the options granted  and to a lesser extent  on implied volatilities from traded options on the company s stock 
for the lattice based model  historical volatility corresponds to the year contractual term of the options granted  whereas  for the black scholes model  historical volatility corresponds to the expected term  which is currently years 
we decided to rely more heavily on historical volatility due to the greater availability of data and reliability of trends over longer periods of time  as compared to the terms of more thinly traded options  which rarely extend beyond two years 
at year end  historical volatilities using weekly price observations ranged from approximately for years to for years  while implied volatilities averaged approximately for traded options with terms in excess of six months 
based on this data  our weighted average composite volatility assumption for purposes of valuing our option grants during was  as compared to for all other assumptions held constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in our volatility assumption would increase or decrease the grant date fair value of our option awards by approximately 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions  we are not required to true up grant date fair value based expense to final intrinsic values 
however  these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options  as explained in the following two paragraphs 
furthermore  as historical data has a significant bearing on our forward looking assumptions  significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions  which could then significantly impact the year over year comparability of stock based compensation expense 
sfas no 
r also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or ve sting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit will be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow 
if this standard had been adopted in  operating cash flow would have been lower and financing cash flow would have been higher by approximately million as a result of this provision 
for and  the corresponding reduction in operating cash flow attributable to windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow was million and million respectively 
the actual impact on future years operating cash flow will depend  in part  on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 
for balance sheet classification purposes  realized windfall tax benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value within the consolidated balance sheet 
realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits  if any  and then charged directly to income tax expense  potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate 
under the transition rules for adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  we were permitted to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits 
we completed such study prior to the first period of adoption and currently have sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls  such that earnings are not currently expected to be affected by this provision 
however  as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control  the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we follow sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits 
table of contents provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees active working life 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom  and canada 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are generally not revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equated to approximately the th percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign trust investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan assets 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december   a basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
correspondingly  a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss 
any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
under this recognition method  a basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in for each of the three fiscal years  our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions   to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately million 
any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years  resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by sfas no 
the net experience gain arising from recognition of claims experience was approximately million 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities  with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index for our us plans 
to test the appropriateness of these indices  we periodically conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities  consisting principally of aa rated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions non callable issues with at least million principal outstanding 
the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to 
table of contents pay benefits as they become due 
for those years where no suitable bonds are available  the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years 
as of three different interim dates during and four different dates during  this matching exercise for our us plans produced a discount rate within basis points of the equivalent dated citigroup pension liability index 
the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our company s fiscal year end 
thus  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of december   we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 
billion  as compared to approximately 
billion at december  the year over year decline in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of rising discount rates on our benefit obligations 
of the total unamortized amounts at december   approximately was related to discount rate reductions prior to  with the remainder primarily related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate 
for  we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately million lower than the actual amount of approximately million 
as discussed on page  total employee benefits expense for is expected to be slightly lower than the amount  due to increases in the discount rate environment and the on going phase in of favorable asset returns 
assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions  annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would decrease versus the amount 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit should be recognized in our income tax expense 
we establish tax reserves in accordance with fin no 
which we adopted at the beginning of 
fin no 
is based on a benefit recognition model  which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain circumstances 
prior to the adoption of fin no 
 our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
the initial application of fin no 
resulted in a net decrease to the company s consolidated accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately million  with an offsetting increase to retained earnings 
the company evaluates a tax position in two steps in accordance with fin no 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the position 
in weighing the technical merits of the position  we consider the facts and circumstances of the position  we assume the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position  and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance 
the second step is measurement  a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
while reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes  the company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
for the periods presented  our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately million 
reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded of earnings before income taxes annually 
significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
the current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities 
likewise  the current portion of related interest reserves are presented in the balance sheet within accrued other liabilities  with the amount expected to be settled after one year recorded in other noncurrent liabilities 

table of contents future outlook our forecasted consolidated results are generally based on our long term annual growth targets as discussed on page  although we currently expect our internal net sales could increase at a mid single digit rate  slightly exceeding our low single digit growth target 
we expect this higher than targeted growth to come principally from previously announced pricing initiatives  improved product mix and continued innovation 
despite a projected decline in gross margin of approximately basis points  which is being negatively impacted by basis points due to acquisitions and basis points due to up front costs recorded in cost of goods sold  we believe the higher than targeted sales growth will support mid single digit consolidated operating profit growth 
as discussed on page  net interest expense for is expected to be comparable to expense  and our consolidated effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 
finally  as discussed in more detail on page  our fiscal year will benefit from a rd week 
the benefit associated with this extra week will be largely invested in emerging markets and various acquisitions in the united states 
these factors are expected to provide the growth necessary to achieve our target of high single digit growth in net earnings per share 
in addition  we remain committed to reinvesting in brand building  cost reduction initiatives  and other growth opportunities 
lastly  we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting cash flow to be approximately even with our results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  intercompany loans and product shipments 
our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and enter into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end and million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
interest rate risk our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
note within notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on our significant debt issues 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year end and assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in and million in price risk our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  paperboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 
table of contents months 
during  we entered into two separate year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes 
the notional amount of the swaps totaled million as of december  and equates to approximately of our north america manufacturing needs 
at year end  the notional amount was million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement receivable of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  the settlement receivable would decrease by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  this settlement obligation would increase by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
in addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above  we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure 
it should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company
