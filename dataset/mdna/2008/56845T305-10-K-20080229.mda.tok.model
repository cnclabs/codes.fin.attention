table of contents item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to the oil and natural gas industry and to our business oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and a decline in oil and natural gas prices would reduce our revenues  profitability and cash flow and impede our growth 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow depend substantially upon the prices and demand for oil and natural gas 
the markets for these commodities are volatile and even relatively modest drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results and impede our growth 
oil and natural gas prices are currently at or near historical highs and may fluctuate and decline significantly in the near future 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  price and quantity of foreign imports  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other state controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls  level of consumer product demand  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  political conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  including the current conflicts in the middle east and conditions in south america and russia  weather conditions  technological advances affecting oil and natural gas consumption  overall us and global economic conditions  and price and availability of alternative fuels 
further  oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other 
to the extent that oil or natural gas comprises more than of our production or estimated proved reserves  our financial results may be more sensitive to movements in prices of that commodity 
lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis  but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item business estimated proved reserves 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the quantities and present value of our reserves  which may lower our bank borrowing base and reduce our access to capital 
estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise 
it requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions  including price and other economic conditions 
in preparing estimates we project production rates and timing of development expenditures 
we also analyze the available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
this process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of 
table of contents which are beyond our control 
at december   of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped 
if the interpretations or assumptions we use in arriving at our estimates prove to be inaccurate  the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover may differ materially from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves shown in this report 
see item business estimated proved reserves for information about our oil and gas reserves 
in estimating future net revenues from estimated proved reserves  we assume that future prices and costs are fixed and apply a fixed discount factor 
if any such assumption or the discount factor is materially inaccurate  our revenues  profitability and cash flow could be materially less than our estimates 
the present value of future net revenues from our estimated proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves on fixed prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
in addition  discounted future net cash flows are estimated assuming that royalties to the mms  with respect to our affected offshore gulf of mexico properties  will be paid or suspended for the life of the properties based upon oil and natural gas prices as of the date of the estimate 
see item business royalty relief and item legal proceedings 
since actual future prices fluctuate over time  royalties may be required to be paid for various portions of the life of the properties and suspended for other portions of the life of the properties 
the timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor that we use to calculate the net present value of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with sec rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry  in general  will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor in arriving at an accurate net present value of future net cash flows 
if oil and natural gas prices decrease  we may be required to write down the carrying value and or the estimates of total reserves of our oil and natural gas properties 
accounting rules applicable to us require that we review periodically the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment 
based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans  production data  economics and other factors  we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
a write down constitutes a non cash charge to earnings 
we may incur non cash charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
we may also reduce our estimates of the reserves that may be economically recovered  which could have the effect of reducing the value of our reserves 
we need to replace our reserves at a faster rate than companies whose reserves have longer production periods 
our failure to replace our reserves would result in decreasing reserves and production over time 
unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proven reserves  our estimated proved reserves will decline as reserves are depleted 
producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors 
high production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties during the initial few years of production 
a significant portion of our current operations are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
production from reserves in the gulf of mexico generally declines more rapidly than reserves from reservoirs in other producing regions 
as a result  our need to replace reserves from new investments is relatively greater than those of producers who produce their reserves over a longer time period  such as those producers whose reserves are located in areas where the rate 
table of contents of reserve production is lower 
if we are not able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production  our production rates will decline even if we drill the undeveloped locations that were included in our estimated proved reserves 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are dependent on our success in economically finding or acquiring new reserves and efficiently developing our existing reserves 
approximately of our total estimated proved reserves are either developed non producing or undeveloped and those reserves may not ultimately be produced or developed 
as of december   approximately of our total estimated proved reserves were developed non producing and approximately were undeveloped 
these reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced 
furthermore  not all of our undeveloped or developed non producing reserves may be ultimately produced during the time periods we have planned  at the costs we have budgeted  or at all  which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
any production problems related to our gulf of mexico properties could reduce our revenue  profitability and cash flow materially 
a substantial portion of our exploration and production activities is located in the gulf of mexico 
this concentration of activity makes us more vulnerable than some other industry participants to the risks associated with the gulf of mexico  including delays and increased costs relating to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes  which are common in the gulf of mexico during certain times of the year  drilling rig and other oilfield services and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations 
our exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes  which are common in the gulf of mexico during certain times of the year  compliance with governmental regulations  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  and limitations in the market for oil and natural gas 
if any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular project  we could lose all or a part of our investment in the project  or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the project  either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our exploratory drilling projects are based in part on seismic data  which is costly and cannot ensure the commercial success of the project 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists and geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon 
table of contents indicators 
d seismic data do not enable an interpreter to conclusively determine whether hydrocarbons are present or producible economically 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies require greater predrilling expenditures than other drilling strategies 
because of these factors  we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures 
poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows  ability to replace reserves and results of operations 
oil and gas drilling and production involve many business and operating risks  any one of which could reduce our levels of production  cause substantial losses or prevent us from realizing profits 
our business is subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  uncontrollable flows of underground natural gas  oil and formation water  natural events and natural disasters  such as loop currents  and hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occurs  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations and repairs to resume operations 
our offshore operations involve special risks that could increase our cost of operations and adversely affect our ability to produce oil and natural gas 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or leasehold acquisitions  or result in loss of equipment and properties 
exploration for oil or natural gas in the deepwater gulf of mexico generally involves greater operational and financial risks than exploration on the shelf 
deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies  involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs 
moreover  deepwater projects often lack proximity to the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  necessitating significant capital investment in subsea flow line infrastructure 
subsea tieback production systems require substantial time and the use of advanced and very sophisticated installation equipment supported by remotely operated vehicles 
these operations may encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant cost overruns 
as a result  a significant amount of time and capital must be invested before we can market the associated oil or natural gas  increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations 
because of the lack and high cost of infrastructure  some reserve discoveries in the deepwater may never be produced 
table of contents economically 
see item business properties gulf of mexico deepwater operations in this annual report on form k for information about our use of tieback technology 
our hedging transactions may not protect us adequately from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and may limit future potential gains from increases in commodity prices or result in losses 
we typically enter into hedging arrangements pertaining to a substantial portion of our expected future production in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
these financial arrangements typically take the form of price swap contracts and costless collars 
hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including situations when the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract or production is less than expected 
during periods of high commodity prices  hedging arrangements may limit significantly the extent to which we can realize financial gains from such higher prices 
our hedging arrangements reduced the benefit we received from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas by approximately million in  increased the benefit we received by million in  and increased the benefit we received by million in although we currently maintain an active hedging program  we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions in the future 
as a result  we may be affected adversely during periods of declining oil and natural gas prices 
counterparty contract default could have an adverse effect on us 
our revenues are generated under contracts with various counterparties 
results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of non performance by any of these counterparties of their contractual obligations under the various contracts 
a counterparty s default or non performance could be caused by factors beyond our control such as a counterparty experiencing credit default 
a default could occur as a result of circumstances relating directly to the counterparty  such as defaulting on its credit obligations  or due to circumstances caused by other market participants having a direct or indirect relationship with the counterparty 
defaults by counterparties may occur from time to time  and this could negatively impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
properties we acquire may not produce as projected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 
properties we acquire may not produce as expected  may be in an unexpected condition and may subject us to increased costs and liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
the reviews we conduct of acquired properties  prior to acquisition  are not capable of identifying all potential adverse conditions 
generally  it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition 
ordinarily  we will focus our review efforts on the higher value properties or properties with known adverse conditions and will sample the remainder 
however  even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems or permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their condition  any deficiencies  and development potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as ground water contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation or the remote location of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
in deepwater operations  the availability of a ready market depends on the proximity of  and our ability to tie into  existing production platforms owned or operated by others and the ability to negotiate commercially satisfactory arrangements with the owners or operators 
we may be required 
table of contents to shut in wells or delay initial production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system capacity 
when that occurs  we are unable to realize revenue from those wells until the production can be tied to a gathering system 
this can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and natural gas and realization of revenues 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or personnel could affect adversely our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within budget  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
increased drilling activity since has resulted in service cost increases and shortages in drilling rigs  personnel  equipment and supplies in certain areas 
shortages in availability or the high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or personnel could delay or affect adversely our exploration and development operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
increases in drilling activity in the united states or the gulf of mexico could exacerbate this situation 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours  giving them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
many of our competitors are major and large independent oil and natural gas companies and possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
financial difficulties encountered by our farm out partners  working interest owners or third party operators could adversely affect our ability to timely complete the exploration and development of our prospects 
from time to time  we enter into farm out agreements to fund a portion of the exploration and development costs of our prospects 
moreover  other companies operate some of the other properties in which we have an ownership interest 
liquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our partners and co owners of our properties may lead to a delay in the pace of drilling or project development that may be detrimental to a project 
in addition  our farm out partners and working interest owners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due 
in the case of a farm out partner  we may have to obtain alternative funding in order to complete the exploration and development of the prospects subject to the farm out agreement 
in the case of a working interest owner  we may be required to pay the working interest owner s share of the project costs 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the capital necessary in order to fund either of these contingencies 
we cannot control the timing or scope of drilling and development activities on properties we do not operate  and therefore we may not be in a position to control the associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have a limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted 
table of contents returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities 
the success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that are outside of our control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells and selection of technology 
compliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could affect production negatively 
exploration for and development  production and sale of oil and natural gas in the united states and the gulf of mexico are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with these environmental and other requirements 
matters subject to regulation include  among others  environmental assessment prior to development  discharge and emission permits for drilling and production operations  drilling bonds  and reports concerning operations and taxation 
under these laws and regulations  and also common law causes of action  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of pollutants and hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with required permits may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to remedial obligations  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
we cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations  whether additional or more stringent laws and regulations will be adopted or the effect these interpretations and adoptions may have on our business or financial condition 
for example  the opa imposes a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  environmental laws or regulations promulgated pursuant to the opa could have a material adverse impact on us 
further  congress or the mms could decide to limit exploratory drilling or natural gas production in additional areas of the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item business regulation for more information on our regulatory and environmental matters 
compliance with mms regulations could significantly delay or curtail our operations or require us to make material expenditures  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
a significant portion of our operations are located on federal oil and natural gas leases that are administered by the mms 
as an offshore operator  we must obtain mms approval for our exploration  development and production plans prior to commencing such operations 
the mms has promulgated regulations that  among other things  require us to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications  restrict the flaring or venting of natural gas  govern the plug and abandonment of wells located offshore and the installation and removal of all production facilities and govern the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases 
our insurance may not protect us against our business and operating risks 
we maintain insurance for some  but not all  of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business 
for some risks  we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
as a result of the losses sustained in from hurricanes katrina and rita  as well as other factors affecting market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies  including windstorm insurance  have increased substantially 
in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
as a result  we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 

table of contents although we maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice  we are not fully insured against all risks  including drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we have not yet been able to determine the full extent of our insurance recovery and the net cost to us resulting from the hurricanes 
see item business insurance matters and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information 
risks relating to significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions the evaluation and integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult 
we periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves  properties  prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy 
significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve many risks  including diversion of our management s attention to evaluating  negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions  challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations  information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business  our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses  operations or properties  possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations  including assumptions relating to reserves  future production  volumes  revenues  costs and synergies  difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations  and challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process  which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business 
if our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process  or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process  our business could suffer 
if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a significant acquisition  our results of operations may be lower than we expect 
the success of a significant acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities from combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours 
even if a combination is successful  it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves  production volume  cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame 
anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices  or in oil and natural gas industry conditions  or by risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations  or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties 
if we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
financing and other liabilities of a significant acquisition may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or be dilutive to stockholders 
future significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions could result in our incurring additional debt  contingent liabilities and expenses  all of which could decrease our liquidity or otherwise have a material 
table of contents adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  an issuance of securities in connection with such transactions could dilute or lessen the rights of our current common stockholders 
risks relating to financings we will require additional capital to fund our future activities 
if we fail to obtain additional capital  we may not be able to implement fully our business plan  which could lead to a decline in reserves 
we may require financing beyond our cash flow from operations to fully execute our business plan 
historically  we have financed our business plan and operations primarily with internally generated cash flow  bank borrowings  proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties  exploration arrangements with other parties  the issuance of debt securities  privately raised equity and borrowings from affiliates 
in the future  we will require substantial capital to fund our business plan and operations 
we expect to meet our needs from our excess cash flow  debt financings and additional equity offerings 
sufficient capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we cannot obtain additional capital resources  we may curtail our drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms 
the issuance of additional debt would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other competitors 
additionally  if revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties or declines in reserves  our ability to obtain the capital necessary to undertake or complete future exploration and development programs and to pursue other opportunities may be limited 
this could also result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could result in a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
we may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations 
we expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to price volatility 
as a result  the amount of debt that we can manage  in some periods  may not be appropriate for us in other periods 
additionally  our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments  including the notes 
any insufficiency could negatively impact our business 
a range of economic  competitive  business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance and  as a result  our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt 
many of these factors  such as oil and natural gas prices  economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of our competitors  are beyond our control 
our debt level and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt obligations 
our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt could have important consequences for our operations  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on debt  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other activities  limiting management s discretion in operating our business  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  
table of contents detracting from our ability to withstand  successfully  a downturn in our business or the economy generally  placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors  and making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  because debt under our bank credit facility will  in some cases  vary with prevailing interest rates 
we may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances 
if we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt  it could lead to an event of default and the consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt 
our ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic and financial conditions 
in addition  under the terms of our bank credit facility and the indentures governing our two series of senior unsecured notes  we must comply with certain financial covenants  including current asset and total debt ratio requirements 
our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance  which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  market and competitive factors  in particular the selling prices for our products and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy 
the breach of any of the covenants in the indentures or the bank credit facility could result in a default under the applicable agreement  which would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders  as the case may be  to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
if we are unable to repay our debt out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering 
we cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or those future borrowings  equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
the terms of our debt  including our bank credit facility  may also prohibit us from taking such actions 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock  a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions  the value of our assets and our operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure that any such offerings  refinancing or sale of assets could be successfully completed

item legal proceedings 
mariner and its subsidiary  mariner energy resources  inc meri  own numerous properties in the gulf of mexico 
certain of such properties were leased from the mms subject to the rra 
this act relieved lessees of the obligation to pay royalties on certain leases until a designated volume was produced 
two of these leases held by the company and one held by meri contained language that limited royalty relief if commodity prices exceeded predetermined levels 
since  commodity prices have exceeded some of the predetermined levels  except in the company and meri believe the mms did not have the authority to include commodity price threshold language in these leases and have withheld payment of royalties on the 
table of contents leases while disputing the mms authority in pending proceedings 
the company has recorded a liability for of its estimated exposure on these leases  which at december  was million  including interest 
the potential liability of meri under its lease relates to production from the lease commencing july   the effective date of mariner s acquisition of meri 
legal and administrative proceedings include in april  the interior board of land appeals denied mariner s administrative appeal of the mms april order asserting royalties were due for production during calendar year because price thresholds had been exceeded 
in october  mariner filed suit in the us district court for the southern district of texas seeking judicial review of the dismissal 
upon motion of the mms  the company s lawsuit was dismissed on procedural grounds 
in august  the company filed an appeal of such dismissal 
in august  the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed the dismissal on procedural grounds 
the fifth circuit s dismissal is now final and unappealable 
however  the company believes the royalties asserted in the mms april order are covered by its may order noted below  which the company is appealing 
in may  the mms issued an order asserting price thresholds were exceeded in calendar years   and and  accordingly  that royalties were due under such leases on oil and gas produced in those years 
mariner has filed and is pursuing an administrative appeal of that order 
the mms has not yet made demand for non payment of royalties alleged to be due for calendar years subsequent to on the basis of price thresholds being exceeded

we used million of the remaining net proceeds of approximately million to repay borrowings drawn on our bank credit facility  and the balance to pay down million of a million promissory note payable to a former affiliate

the energy markets have historically been very volatile 
commodity prices are currently at or near historical highs and may fluctuate significantly in the future

production shut in and deferred because of the hurricanes impact totaled approximately to bcfe during 
table of contents the last two quarters of as of december  approximately mmcfe per day of production remained shut in awaiting repairs  primarily associated with our green canyon baccarat property  which was brought back on line in january while physical damage to our existing platforms and facilities was relatively minor from both hurricanes  the effects of the storms caused damage to onshore pipeline and processing facilities that resulted in a portion of our production being temporarily shut in  or in the case of our viosca knoll swordfish project  postponed until the fourth quarter of in addition  hurricane katrina caused damage to platforms that host three of our development projects mississippi canyon pluto  mississippi canyon rigel  and mississippi canyon ochre 
our rigel project recommenced production in the first quarter of  and our pluto and ochre projects recommenced production in the third quarter of production in the gulf of mexico increased to bcfe for from bcfe for  while onshore production increased to bcfe for from bcfe for natural gas  oil and ngl revenues total natural gas  oil and ngl revenues increased to million for compared to million for natural gas revenues were million and million for and  respectively 
total oil and ngl revenues for were million compared to million for natural gas prices excluding the effects of hedging for averaged mcf compared to mcf for oil prices excluding the effects of hedging for averaged bbl compared to bbl for for  hedges increased average natural gas pricing by mcf to mcf and increased average oil pricing by bbl to bbl  resulting in a net recognized hedging gain of million 
the cash activity on contracts settled for natural gas and oil produced during resulted in an million gain 
an unrealized gain of million was recognized for related to the ineffective portion of open contracts that were not eligible for deferral under sfas due primarily to the basis differentials between the contract price  which is nymex based for oil and henry hub based for gas  and the indexed price at the point of sale 
in addition  the fair value of oil and natural gas derivatives acquired through the forest merger resulted in a million non cash gain 
the fair value of the acquired derivatives was fully recognized in lease operating expense including workover expenses was million for compared to million for the increase primarily was attributable to the consolidation of the forest gulf of mexico operations and increased costs attributable to the addition of new productive wells onshore 
per unit operating expenses rose to per mcfe for compared to per mcfe for continued shut in production from the impact of the hurricanes contributed to the increased per unit operating costs 
severance and ad valorem taxes were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased production and appreciated property values on west texas properties 
for and  severance and ad valorem taxes were and per mcfe  respectively 
transportation expense for was million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe  for the increase in expense was primarily due to increased production 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million from million for and  respectively 
the increase was a result of increased production due to the consolidation of the forest gulf of mexico operations  as well as an increase in the unit of production depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
the per unit rate increased to mcfe from mcfe for and  respectively 
the per unit increase was primarily due to an increase in deepwater development activities and the forest gulf of mexico operations  as well as increased accretion of asset retirement obligations due to the forest gulf of mexico operations 
general and administrative expense totaled million for  compared to million for g a expense includes charges for share based compensation expense of million for compared to million for for  million of share based compensation expense resulted from amortization of the cost of restricted stock granted at the closing of mariner s equity private placement in march 
table of contents and the remaining related to the amortization of new grants issued in with vesting periods of three to four years 
the restricted stock related to mariner s equity private placement fully vested by may and there will be no future charges related to those stock grants 
the share based compensation expense relates solely to the amortization of the restricted stock granted under mariner s private equity placement 
included in the g a expenses are severance  retention  relocation and transition costs of million related to the acquisition of the forest gulf of mexico operations

net interest expense increased to million from million for and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels to million for from million for the increased debt was primarily the result of the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due  the assumption of debt in the forest merger of million  hurricane repairs and related abandonment costs of million  and acquisition of interests in west cameron for million 
additionally  the amendment and restatement of the bank credit facility on march  was treated as an extinguishment of debt for accounting purposes  and resulted in a charge of million to interest expense 
capitalized interest increased from million in to million in income before taxes and minority interest increased to million from million for and  respectively 
this increase was primarily the result of higher operating income attributed to the forest gulf of mexico operations 
provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of for as compared to an effective tax rate of for the comparable period of the increase in the effective tax rate for was primarily a result of the texas margins tax  which was enacted during the second quarter of for all properties located in texas

table of contents reconciliation of non gaap measure operating cash flow operating cash flow ocf is not a financial or operating measure under gaap 
the table below reconciles ocf to related gaap information 
we believe that ocf is a widely accepted financial indicator that provides additional information about our ability to meet our future requirements for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital  but ocf should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity

the increase was due to greater operating revenue due to increased production of mmcfe per day or million and an increase in the realized price per mcfe of or million  offset by higher lease operating expense and an increase in hurricane related expenditures 
as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of million  including non cash current derivative assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  working capital is negatively impacted by accrued capital expenditures 
this deficit will be funded by cash flow from operating activities and our bank credit facility  as needed 
net cash flows used in investing activities increased to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increased capital expenditures of approximately million attributable to increased activity in our drilling programs 
this increase was partially offset by million of restricted cash received in january from the sale of our interest in cottonwood and million of forest merger acquisition costs paid in net cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in the million decrease was due primarily to repayment of million of debt under our bank credit facility offset by proceeds from our issuance in april of million aggregate principal amount of notes due in and financings in  which were primarily used to fund the forest merger 
on march   mariner also paid the remaining balance of a term note payable to a former affiliate 

table of contents uses of capital 
our primary uses of capital during were as follows funding capital expenditures excluding hurricane repairs and acquisitions of approximately million  funding hurricane repairs and hurricane related abandonment expenditures of approximately million  paying interest of approximately million  paying the purchase price for west texas assets of approximately million  and paying routine operating and administrative expenses

hurricane expenditures 
during the year ended  we incurred approximately million in hurricane expenditures resulting from hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita  of which million were repairs and million were hurricane related abandonment costs 
substantially all of the costs incurred pertained to the gulf of mexico assets acquired from forest 
since  we have incurred approximately million in hurricane expenditures from hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita  of which million were repairs and million were hurricane related abandonment costs 
net of our deductible of million and insurance proceeds received of million  our insurance receivable at december  was million  of which million is expected to be settled within the next months 
however  due to the magnitude of hurricanes katrina and rita and the complexity of the insurance claims being processed by the insurance industry  the timing of our ultimate insurance recovery cannot be ascertained 
we expect to maintain a potentially significant insurance receivable for the indefinite future  while we actively pursue settlement of our claims to minimize the impact to our working capital and liquidity 
any differences between our insurance recoveries and insurance receivables will be recorded as adjustments to our oil and natural gas properties 
sources of capital 
our primary sources of capital during were as follows cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility  and proceeds from our issuance of million aggregate principal amount of notes 

table of contents bank credit facility effective january   mariner further amended its bank credit facility to  among other things  increase the maximum credit availability to billion for revolving loans  including up to million in letters of credit  with a million borrowing base as of that date 
as amended  the bank credit facility will mature on january  on january   the company borrowed million under its bank credit facility to finance its gulf of mexico shelf acquisition  bringing total outstanding borrowings thereunder to million as of that date 
mariner s obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties and certain other assets in favor of the lenders under the agreement 
during  the borrowing base under the bank credit facility was million 
as of december   million was outstanding under the bank credit facility  and the interest rate was 
in addition  four letters of credit totaling million excluding the dedicated letter of credit discussed below were outstanding  of which million is required for plugging and abandonment obligations at certain of the company s offshore fields 
the outstanding principal balance of loans under the bank credit facility may not exceed the borrowing base 
if the borrowing base falls below the sum of the amount borrowed and uncollateralized letter of credit exposure  then to the extent of the deficit  the company must prepay borrowings and cash collateralize letter of credit exposure  pledge additional unencumbered collateral  repay borrowings and cash collateralize letters of credit on an installment basis  or effect some combination of these actions 
on march   mariner obtained under its bank credit facility a dedicated million letter of credit in favor of forest to secure mariner s performance of its obligations to drill and complete wells under a drill to earn program the dedicated letter of credit 
the dedicated letter of credit was not included as a use of the borrowing base and reduced periodically by an amount equal to the product of million times the number of wells exceeding that were drilled and completed 
as of december   mariner drilled and completed all wells under the program and the dedicated letter of credit was cancelled in january the dedicated letter of credit balance as of december  was million 
the bank credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and other usual and customary terms and conditions  including limitations on the payment of cash dividends and other restricted payments  the incurrence of additional debt  the sale of assets and speculative hedging 
the financial covenants under the bank credit facility require the company to  among other things maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets plus the unused borrowing base to consolidated current liabilities of not less than to  and maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  of not more than to the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the bank credit facility as of december  the company must pay a commitment fee of to per year on the unused availability under the bank credit facility 
senior notes mariner has outstanding the following two issues of debt issued in registered transactions  referred to collectively as the notes million principal amount of senior notes due issued in march million principal amount of senior notes due issued in april the notes are senior unsecured obligations of mariner  rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness  rank equally in right of payment with each other and with mariner s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to mariner s senior secured indebtedness  including its obligations under its bank credit facility  to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness  and to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any non guarantor subsidiaries

table of contents costs associated with the notes offering were approximately million  excluding discounts of million 
costs associated with the notes offering included aggregate underwriting discounts of approximately million and offering expenses of approximately million 
future uses of capital 
our identified needs for liquidity in the future are as follows funding future capital expenditures  funding hurricane repairs and hurricane related abandonment operations  financing any future acquisitions that mariner may identify  paying routine operating and administrative expenses  and paying other commitments comprised largely of cash settlement of hedging obligations and debt service 
capital expenditures 
we anticipate that our base operating capital expenditures for will be approximately million excluding hurricane related expenditures and acquisitions  including an acquisition in january totaling approximately million  with significant potential expansion contingent on drilling success and cash flow experience during the year 
approximately of the base operating capital program is planned to be allocated to development activities  to exploration activities  and the remainder to other items primarily capitalized overhead and interest 
in addition  we expect to incur additional hurricane related abandonment costs during related to hurricanes katrina and rita of approximately million that we believe is covered under applicable insurance  although complete recovery or settlement is not expected to occur during the next months 
obligations and commitments consolidated contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period thereafter total in millions debt obligations letters of credit interest obligations operating leases abandonment liabilities mms royalty liabilities seismic obligations capital accrual obligations other liabilities total contractual cash commitments as of december   we had incurred debt obligations under our bank credit facility and under our notes and notes 
interest obligations represent interest due on the senior unsecured notes at and 
future interest obligations under our bank credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate on fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility as of december   million  million and million would be due under the bank credit facility by  and  respectively 
other liabilities include accrued loe of million  accrued liabilities of million  gas balancing of million  oil and gas payable of million  accrued compensation of million and other liabilities for million 

table of contents adequacy of capital sources and liquidity future capital resources 
our anticipated sources of liquidity in the future are as follows cash flow from operations in future periods  proceeds under our bank credit facility  proceeds from insurance policies relating to hurricane repairs  and proceeds from future capital markets transactions as needed 
in  we intend to tailor our operating capital program exclusive of hurricane related expenditures and acquisitions within our projected operating cash flow so that our operating capital requirements are largely self sustaining under normal commodity price assumptions 
we anticipate using proceeds under our bank credit facility only for working capital needs or acquisitions and not generally to fund our operations 
we would generally expect to fund future acquisitions on a case by case basis through a combination of bank debt and capital markets activities 
based on our current operating plan and assumed price case  our expected cash flow from operations and continued access to our bank credit facility allows us ample liquidity to conduct our operations as planned for the foreseeable future 
the timing of expenditures especially regarding deepwater projects is unpredictable 
also  our cash flows are heavily dependent on the oil and natural gas commodity markets  and our ability to hedge oil and natural gas prices 
if either oil or natural gas commodity prices decrease from their current levels  our ability to finance our planned capital expenditures could be affected negatively 
amounts available for borrowing under our bank credit facility are largely dependent on our level of estimated proved reserves and current oil and natural gas prices 
if either our estimated proved reserves or commodity prices decrease  amounts available to us to borrow under our bank credit facility could be reduced 
if our cash flows are less than anticipated or amounts available for borrowing are reduced  we may be forced to defer planned capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements mariner s bank credit facility has a letter of credit subfacility of up to million that is included as a use of the borrowing base 
as of december   four such letters of credit totaling million were outstanding 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of mariner s financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  oil and gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  goodwill  abandonment liabilities  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  depreciation  depletion and amortization  share based compensation  and full cost ceiling calculation 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents oil and gas properties our oil and gas properties are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized  including certain general and administrative expenses 
depletion of oil and gas properties is provided using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the sale or disposition of oil and gas properties unless the sale or disposition represents a significant quantity of oil and gas reserves  which would have a significant impact on the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
at the end of each quarter  a full cost ceiling limitation calculation is made whereby net capitalized costs related to proved properties less related deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from estimated proved reserves plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less estimated future production and development costs and related income tax expense 
the full cost ceiling limitation is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves 
we use derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas to hedge against the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices and  in accordance with sec guidelines  we include estimated future cash flows from our hedging program in our ceiling test calculation 
if net capitalized costs related to proved properties less related deferred income taxes were to exceed this limit  the excess would be impaired and a permanent write down would be recorded on our consolidated statements of operations 
additional guidance was provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic d c  primarily regarding the use of cash flow hedges  asset retirement obligations  and the effect of subsequent events on the ceiling test calculation 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
estimated proved reserves our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
estimates of proved reserves are key components in determining our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by ryder scott company  lp unproved properties the costs associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development are not initially included in the full cost depletion base 
some unevaluated costs include but are not limited to unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress  wells pending determination and capitalized interest costs associated with these projects 
unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the depletion base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a lease 
geological and geophysical costs  including d seismic data costs  are included in the full cost depletion base as incurred when such costs cannot be associated with specific unevaluated properties for which we own a direct interest 
seismic data costs are associated with specific unevaluated properties if the seismic data is acquired for the purpose of evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold interest owned by us 
we make this determination based on an analysis of leasehold and seismic maps and discussions with our chief exploration officer 
geological and geophysical costs included in unproved properties are transferred to the full cost depletion base along with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the depletion base once a determination is made whether or not 
table of contents estimated proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
costs of dry holes are transferred to the depletion base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
all items included in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of liabilities assumed in the acquisition 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires an annual impairment assessment and a more frequent assessment if certain events occur that indicate impairment may have occurred 
we performed the goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of the initial impairment assessment compares mariner s net book value to its estimated fair value 
if impairment is indicated  then mariner is required to make estimates of the fair value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value of goodwill is based on many factors  including future net cash flows of estimated proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration and development of unproved reserves 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  then a measurement of the loss is performed with any excess charged to expense 
to date  no impairment to goodwill has been recorded 
income taxes our provision for taxes includes both state and federal taxes 
mariner records its federal income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry forwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be recovered 
we apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from these estimates  which could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  in may  the state of texas enacted substantial changes to its tax structure beginning in by implementing a new margin tax of to be imposed on revenues less certain costs  as specified in the legislation 
abandonment liability sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we adopted sfas on january  sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  we employ a present value technique  which reflects certain assumptions  including our credit adjusted risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 

table of contents hedging program we use derivative instruments in the form of natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements and costless collar arrangements in order to manage the price risk associated with future crude oil and natural gas production and fixed price crude oil and natural gas purchase and sale commitments 
such agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges whereby gains and losses resulting from these transactions  recorded at market value  are reported in other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
once the physical production that was hedged by the contracts is delivered  then the gain or loss is recognized in net income in our consolidated statements of operations 
we are required to assess the effectiveness of all our derivative contracts at inception and at every quarter end 
if open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting  mark to market accounting is utilized and changes in the fair value of open contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
not qualifying for hedge accounting may cause volatility in net income 
fair value is assessed  measured and estimated by obtaining market quotes  credit adjusted risk free interest rates and estimated volatility factors from independent third parties 
in addition  forward price curves and estimates of future volatility factors are used to assess and measure the effectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period 
the fair values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the net cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as oil and gas revenues and presented in cash flows from operations 
if the hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity  gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period as the physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered 
the conditions to be met for a derivative instrument to qualify as a cash flow hedge are the following i the item to be hedged exposes mariner to price risk  ii the derivative reduces the risk exposure and is designated as a hedge at the time the derivative contract is entered into and iii at the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedge period there  is a high correlation of changes in the market value of the derivative instrument and the fair value of the underlying item being hedged 
when the designated hedged item associated with a derivative instrument matures  is sold  extinguishes or terminates  derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale or settlement of the underlying item 
when a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if correlation no longer exists  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in income to the extent the future results have not been offset by the effects of price or interest rate changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge 
revenue recognition our natural gas  crude oil and ngl revenues are recorded using the entitlement method 
under the entitlement method  revenue is recorded when title passes based on mariner s net interest or nominated deliveries 
mariner records its entitled share of revenues based on entitled volumes and contracted sales prices 
the sales price for natural gas  crude oil and ngls are adjusted for revenue deductions 
the revenue deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment 
subsequently  these revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third party documents 
historically  these adjustments have been insignificant 
since there is a ready market for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  mariner sells the majority of its products soon after production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
as a result  mariner maintains a minimum amount of product inventory in storage 
gas imbalances occur when mariner sells more or less than its entitled ownership percentage of total gas production 
any amount received in excess overproduction of mariner s share is treated as a liability 
if mariner receives less than it is entitled  the shortage underproduction is recorded as a receivable 
imbalances are reduced either by subsequent recoupment of over and under deliveries or by cash settlement  as required by applicable contracts 
production imbalances are marked to market at the end of each month at the lowest of i the price in effect at the time of production  ii the current market price or iii the contract price  if a 
table of contents contract exists 
mariner s gas imbalances are not material  as oil and natural gas volumes sold are not significantly different from its share of production 
share based compensation expense we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based awards on the grant date  which requires judgment in estimating the expected life of the option and the expected volatility of our stock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  and these differences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to the critical estimates discussed above  estimates are used in accounting and computing depreciation  depletion and amortization  the full cost ceiling  accruals of operating costs and production revenues 
reclassifications and use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements some amounts from the previous years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of consolidated financial statements 
these reclassifications do not affect net income 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements  which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  fasb issued sfas no

the statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not determined the effect that the application of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements

sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value  and thereby mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements

we are evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices and related hedging activities our major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
the sales price of our production is primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for our natural gas and oil production have been volatile and unpredictable 
hypothetically  if production levels were to remain at levels  a increase in commodity prices from those as of december  would increase our cash flow by approximately million for the year ended december  the energy markets have historically been very volatile  and we can reasonably expect that oil and gas prices will be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of oil and natural gas on our operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and natural gas prices from time to time primarily through the use of commodity price swap agreements and costless collar arrangements 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits future gains from favorable movements 
in addition  forward price curves and estimates of future volatility are used to assess and measure the ineffectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period 
if open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting  the mark to market change in fair value is recognized in oil and natural gas revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
not qualifying for hedge accounting and cash flow hedge designation will cause volatility in net income 
the fair values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 

table of contents hedge gains and losses are recorded by commodity type in oil and natural gas revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the effects on our oil and gas revenues from our hedging activities were as follows year ended december  in thousands cash gain loss on settlements gain loss on hedge ineffectiveness non cash gain on hedges acquired total unrealized gain loss recognized in natural gas revenue related to the ineffective portion of open contracts that are not eligible for deferral under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  due primarily to the basis differentials between the contract price and the indexed price at the point of sale

hedges with counterparties that are lenders under our bank credit facility are secured under the bank credit facility 
interest rates borrowings under our bank credit facility as further amended in january  discussed above  mature on january   and bear interest at either a libor based rate or a prime based rate  at our option  plus a specified margin 
both options expose us to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market rates 
we have not entered into interest rate hedges that would mitigate such risk 
during  the interest rate on our outstanding bank debt averaged 
if the balance of our bank debt at december  were to remain constant  a increase in market interest rates would decrease our cash flow by approximately million for the year ended december
