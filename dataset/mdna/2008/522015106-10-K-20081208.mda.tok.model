overview nature of the business 
learning tree international is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider to business and government organizations for the training and education of their managers and information technology professionals 
since our founding in  we have provided high quality training to nearly million managers and it professionals 
in fiscal year we trained  course participants from more than  organizations worldwide  including large national and multinational companies  government organizations  and small and medium size companies 
as of october   we offered a broad proprietary library of intensive instructor led courses from two to five days in length  comprising different course titles representing  hours of training  including information technology course titles and management titles 
learning tree courses provide both breadth and depth of education and training across a wide range of technical and management disciplines  including operating systems  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  web development  programming languages  software engineering  open source applications  project management  business skills  leadership and professional development 
we market and present our courses through local operations in the united states  the united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generate over half of our revenues internationally 
each operating subsidiary is staffed by local personnel responsible for the sale and delivery of learning tree courses in that country 
our infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow us to coordinate  plan and deliver our courses at our own education centers  external hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal year  we presented courses in countries 
we use a well defined systematic approach to develop and update the learning tree course library so as to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
after assessing market need  courses are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
our proprietary course development process also allows us to customize our courses for delivery at our customers sites 
we design our own vendor independent it courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective regarding software and hardware products and the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors 
all learning tree courses are highly interactive  and incorporate extensive hands on exercises or case study workshops 
while addressing core concepts and theory  all of our technical and management courses focus primarily on providing skills  tools  and technologies that participants can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs 
to accomplish this objective  many of our realityplus management courses utilize extensive multi media simulations to teach practical management techniques 
this innovative 
table of contents methodology provides an environment in which realityplus course participants learn entirely by doing 
throughout these courses  they gain extensive experience applying new management skills in life like  challenging situations  within the confines of the classroom and under the guidance of an expert instructor 
as a result  realityplus course participants achieve greater mastery of effective management techniques as well as the confidence needed to apply them  and thus return to their jobs both ready and willing to immediately apply their expanded skills in their workplaces 
we had instructors as of october   who are practicing professionals with expert subject knowledge  and who average over years of hands on  real world experience 
learning tree instructors teach an average of approximately course events per year on an as needed basis 
during the rest of the year they apply the skills that they teach  either as full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
when they are not teaching  learning tree instructors are using and honing their management and it skills as either full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
we offer our proprietary courses through wholly owned local subsidiaries in the united states  the united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generate over half of our revenues internationally 
each operating subsidiary is staffed by local personnel responsible for the sale and delivery of our courses in that country 
our infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow us to coordinate  plan and deliver our courses at learning tree education centers  external hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal year  we presented courses in countries 
we have structured our business so that the majority of our course delivery costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
we schedule our course events throughout the year based on our assessment of demand 
since learning tree instructors typically work full time or as consultants for other business and industry employers  or in the case of management instructors as industry consultants and facilitators  they teach our course events as needed and thus  our instructor related costs are largely variable 
however  expenses associated with our own education centers and course equipment are largely fixed 
we adjust our expenditures for sales and marketing depending on our strategic objectives  which generally include an assessment of our expectations for influencing future customer demand  market conditions and other factors 
however  if our expectations regarding the results of our marketing efforts prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
during fiscal year we continued to make progress toward our goals of increasing revenue growth and profitability 
our growth plan includes a number of core growth initiatives  which were intended to increase our revenues and profitability by leveraging our fixed cost infrastructure 
we began implementing these initiatives in late fiscal year and continued that implementation throughout fiscal year following is a summary of our core growth initiatives  and some information on our progress to date significantly increase the rate of introduction of our new course titles 
in fiscal year we began working to accelerate our revenue growth through the rapid expansion of our course library  which we believe will allow us to serve more customers by meeting a broader set of professional development needs 
performance of new titles has a well established historical track record  and new titles typically grow to full revenue contribution levels approximately two years after introduction 
in fiscal years and we introduced an average of new titles each year 
in fiscal year  we introduced new course titles 
in fiscal year we now anticipate introducing approximately new course titles  of which we had started developing in fiscal year develop and provide blended learning solutions 
while we remain firmly committed to the value of instructor led classroom training as the center point of our business model  we believe there is an opportunity in certain situations to further increase the value of that training by integrating elements of e learning together with our classroom training in blended learning solutions 
as a result  we believe that we can capture greater market share through offering these blended learning solutions to customers where 
table of contents appropriate 
we are actively developing and testing blended learning programs to determine formats that are both educationally effective and commercially viable 
we have also recently developed and introduced a hybrid learning training model  in which students at remote sites can participate real time via the web in an instructor led class being conducted in one of our classrooms or at a customer location 
we have received positive feedback from our customers based on our initial efforts  and expect to expand our experimentation with this approach in the coming months 
continue to improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing 
in recent years  we have used our proprietary post system of cutting edge business intelligence techniques to improve the return on our investment in catalog based direct marketing by between fiscal years and we are now using our post methods to continue improving the effectiveness of our telesales force  to evaluate our investments in marketing  and to identify productive ways to use our database to expand our marketing efforts 
significantly grow our direct sales force 
we continue to believe we have a substantial opportunity to increase our market share of courses held at customer locations  particularly for large  enterprise level customers 
during fiscal year we increased our sales force 
we are now carefully monitoring the productivity and effectiveness of that investment in the current economic environment prior to making further sales staff increases 
provided that we see evidence of productivity from our staffing increases  we intend to continue our investments in this regard 
recent trends 
as we have for the past years  we continue to emphasize excellence in educating and training managers and it professionals from government and commercial organizations around the world 
we believe that quality is a significant differentiator in the eyes of our customers  and that learning tree s proven long term record of exceptional performance is a reason for our clients tremendous loyalty 
it is worth noting that all of our top customers from five years ago in our fiscal year were still learning tree customers five years later in fiscal year we continue our emphasis on excellence by focusing on our core strengths our expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms  application of technology to education  and worldwide course delivery systems 
in fiscal years and  course participants gave our instructors and courses their highest quality ratings in our history 
adjusting our course evaluation scale to a typical grading scale with a maximum possible of  in fiscal years and  our instructors received an average grade of over from their participants 
learning tree customers have continued to respond positively to our increase in the breadth and depth of our management course offerings 
at october   we offered titles in our management curriculum representing of our entire course library  compared to titles  which represented of the learning tree course library at the same point in fiscal year we intend to meet the demand for management education by continuing to develop additional management course titles  and by increasing the sales and marketing for our management course programs 
in response to customer demand and the expressed need for management education that is more relevant to real world business challenges  in fiscal year we introduced our reality plus line of management courses 
we believe that these courses represent a significant advancement in providing state of the art management education 
the current economic climate is having an effect on our business  and many economists are predicting a long  challenging period for the global economy 
we believe that effective training in information technology and management skills improves our customers competitiveness  and many of our customers will continue to invest in training their personnel in these critical competencies 
however  we also expect that some customers will reduce their spending on training services as part of their response to the current economic conditions 
we therefore believe we must manage our business with the expectation that these conditions will adversely affect our revenues  an impact that will only be partially offset by the positive effects of the growth initiatives we instituted last year 
however  there is no guarantee that these approaches will be successful

table of contents we follow a or week fiscal year 
our year end and quarter end dates are on the friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter 
accordingly  our fiscal year ended on september   fiscal year ended on september   and fiscal year ended on october  each of those years comprised weeks  except fiscal year  which was a week fiscal year 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  september  october  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  our revenues increased by to million compared to million in fiscal year income from operations increased by to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net income for fiscal year decreased by to million compared to million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues increased by compared to fiscal year the increase in revenues is primarily due to a increase in the number of participants in our courses  a increase in average revenue per participant and a increase due to higher classroom rental revenues than in fiscal year the increase in revenue per participant was primarily the result of a effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and  to a lesser degree  price increases 
these increases were partly offset by a higher percentage of participants at courses held at customer locations  where the average revenue per participant is lower than for courses held in our own education centers  and by a higher percentage of participants at our management courses  which have a shorter average length than our it courses and accordingly a lower average revenue per participant 
during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training an increase of from the  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses in fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a increase over the  attendee days in fiscal year in our it courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a increase from the  attendee days in fiscal year because of our week accounting convention  our fiscal year had weeks  while fiscal year had 
table of contents revenues in the united states increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year revenues from our international operations increased from million in fiscal year to million fiscal year cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
during fiscal year  we presented  events compared to  events during fiscal year our cost of revenues for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year our cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues declined to for fiscal year from in fiscal year changes in exchange rates do not materially affect our gross profit percentages since exchange rates have essentially the same impact on both revenues and cost of revenues in any time period 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year reflects a increase in average revenue per event partly offset by a increase in average cost per event 
the increase in our average revenue per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  is the result of a increase in average participants per event and the increase in average revenue per participant discussed earlier 
the increase in average cost per event is due primarily to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the increase in participants per event 
gross profit in the united states increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year gross profit from our international operations increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year course development expenses 
we maintain a disciplined process to develop new courses and update our existing courses 
all costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred and are included in course development expenses 
in fiscal year  we began a strategic initiative aimed at significantly increasing the rate at which we develop new course titles  and we began introducing new titles at an accelerated rate in the second quarter of that year 
in fiscal year we introduced new course titles  compared with new course titles introduced in fiscal year of which had their initial public offering during the year 
during fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  we increased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year this increase reflects the costs associated with the development of the greater number of new titles in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
we introduced new management course titles in each of fiscal years and during fiscal year we introduced new it courses  compared with in fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the increase in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate no longer justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  we may or may not develop more titles than we retire in any period 
at october   we had management titles in our course library  compared with management titles at the same point a year earlier 
our library of it titles numbered as of october  compared to titles at the end of fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include the cost of designing  producing and distributing direct mail and media advertisements  marketing e mails and our website  compensation and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  and the cost of information systems to support these activities 

table of contents our sales and marketing expense  and in particular our expenditure on course catalogs  is one of our largest expenditures 
we have adjusted the market segments to which we mail our catalogs  and are presently evaluating a number of additional ways to increase the efficiency of our marketing expenditures by spending less without materially affecting the response to that marketing 
at the same time  we have been increasing our sales staff in our operating units 
our sales and marketing expenses were and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal year included million in personnel related expenses  million in professional service fees  million in advertising expense and million for increases in travel and living  general office expenditures and other items 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in costs associated with printing and mailing our catalogs 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million and represented of revenues compared to in fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increases in professional service fees of million including amounts for tax assistance in conjunction with the implementation of fin million  financial advisory services million and additional legal fees million  and increases of million in personnel related costs including compensation and benefits million  one time charges related to employee compensation for gains on expired stock options million  increases in stock compensation expense million  and an increase in severance expense million  offset by decreases in incentive compensation million

included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal year was million associated with a process to explore the potential sale of the company including employee non contingent transaction contribution bonuses million  and legal  investment banker and board fees million 
we initiated that process on may  and terminated it on october  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in fiscal year decreased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million 
these changes included foreign currency exchange losses as opposed to prior year gains million and a decrease in proceeds from the liquidation in fiscal year of our investment in collegis  inc million  partly offset by a decrease in loss on disposal of assets million and reductions in interest expense million 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year is compared to in fiscal year the low effective rate for fiscal year was attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to our us deferred tax assets which reduced our tax provision by million and million from favorable adjustments from an audit of our canadian subsidiary 
as of the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reversed the valuation allowance for certain state deferred tax assets because we determined it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets were 
table of contents recoverable because of the improved financial performance in the relevant jurisdictions 
the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a net benefit of approximately million 
as of october   we continued to maintain valuation allowances in the us related to foreign tax credit carryovers  and we continued to maintain valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction 
we intend to maintain these valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 
profits and losses incurred in the us and in the foreign jurisdiction will affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowances 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of fin the cumulative effect of the adoption was a million reduction to retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate if recognized 
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of the date of adoption  we had million accrued for interest and million accrued for penalties 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes of international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of october   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings were approximately million as of october  if these earnings were distributed  we would incur approximately million of foreign withholding taxes 
because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  our revenues were million compared to million in fiscal year income from operations was million in fiscal year compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal year net income for fiscal year was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues increased by compared to fiscal year this increase was the result of a increase in revenue per participant which was partially offset by a decrease in the number of participants for our courses 
the increase in revenue per participant was primarily the result of a positive effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  price increases  and lower attendance under the discounted passport programs and higher attendance under the higher priced regular and voucher programs 
during fiscal year  we trained  course participants  a decrease from the  participants that were trained during the prior fiscal year 
for fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training versus the  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a increase over the  attendee days in the corresponding period during fiscal year in our it courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a decrease from the  attendee days during fiscal year cost of revenues

the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to the prior year is due to an increase in average revenue per event of  offset slightly by an increase of in average cost per 
table of contents event 
the increase in our average revenue per event results principally from the increase in average revenue per participant discussed above  a increase in average participants per event  and a slight decrease in the proportion of events held at customer locations  which typically have a lower average revenue per event than events held in our own education centers 
the increase in average cost per event results from the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates  mostly offset by reductions in education center costs and reduced instructor expenses  compared to the prior year 
course development expenses 
during fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during the prior year 
in fiscal year  we decreased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  we had significantly increased our spending on course development primarily in conjunction with the development and updating of our management course curriculum  and the conversion of a significant number of management courses to incorporate our new realityplus format 
during fiscal year we converted management course titles to the realityplus methodology compared to management courses converted in fiscal year we introduced new management course titles in fiscal year compared with new management course titles introduced in fiscal year during fiscal year we introduced it courses  the same as in fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising over  hours of training compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the increase in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate no longer justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  we may or may not develop more titles than we retire in any period

our library of it titles numbered as of september  compared to titles at the end of fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses were and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease due to a reduction in the quantity of catalogs mailed  offset by a million increase in sales compensation expense including incentive compensation  a million increase associated with a provision for use taxes due on catalogs and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million and represented of revenues compared to in fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  a million increase in salary expense  a million increase in incentive compensation expense  a one time increase of million in personnel expense  an expense of million associated with subleasing and facilities arrangements in our united kingdom education center  offset by a decrease of million in professional service fees

table of contents other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of interest income 
during fiscal year  other income  net totaled million  compared to million in fiscal year the increase principally relates to higher interest rates earned on higher invested balances 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year is compared to in fiscal year the low effective rate for fiscal year is attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to our us deferred tax assets which reduced our tax provision by million and million from favorable adjustments from an audit of our canadian subsidiary 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year is unusually high because of the provision related to the canadian transfer pricing tax examination  a worldwide transfer pricing contingency reserve  and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for our us and french operating subsidiaries 
during fiscal year  our canadian subsidiary underwent a transfer pricing tax examination by the canada revenue agency cra with respect to fiscal years and in september  cra proposed a preliminary assessment in the amount of million for additional taxes and interest 
in december  we accepted the proposed assessment and included this amount in our tax provision for fiscal year in july  we requested that cra adjust our canadian income taxes for fiscal years    and in a manner consistent with the adjustments cra required for tax years and in addition  we filed our canadian income tax return for tax year consistent with that methodology 
the impact of adjusting the four additional years and filing the return consistently with the adjusted years  when netted against the assessments for and  resulted in a net benefit to us of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  we established valuation allowances for portions of the deferred tax assets of our us entities and one entity in a foreign jurisdiction 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of these deferred tax assets are recoverable  based on the improved financial performance of the us entities during fiscal year and our expectations for the future 
accordingly  we released the valuation allowance for the assets of the us entities  except for the assets related to foreign tax credit carryovers and the deferred tax assets for certain state jurisdictions 
this release of the valuation allowance resulted in a net benefit of approximately million recognized in the fiscal year tax provision 
our total valuation allowance decreased by million  with the additional decrease attributable to fiscal year results from operations 
as of september   we continued to maintain valuation allowances in the us related to the foreign tax credit carryovers and certain state deferred tax assets  and we continued to maintain a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction 
we intend to maintain these valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 
profits or losses incurred in the us and in the foreign jurisdiction will affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowances 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes of international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of september   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings were approximately million as of september  if these earnings were distributed  we would incur approximately million of foreign withholding taxes 
because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested 
geographic data learning tree education centers are located in six countries and we have historically derived roughly half of our revenues from outside the united states 
the united states operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year revenues from our european operations were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year canadian 
table of contents operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year and our asian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on segment reporting 
although our consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  all of our subsidiaries other than in the us have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on our results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on our foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on our foreign expenses  and vice versa 
the impact of future exchange rates on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore we continue to be subject to such risks 
in the future  we may undertake such hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques we implement would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
see item a 
inflation inflation and changing prices do not have a significant impact on our net sales  revenues and income from continuing operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements but applies to other standards that require fair value measurement 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no  effective data of fasb statement no 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we will adopt fsp beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year in october  the fasb issued fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  to clarify the application of sfas to financial assets in a market that is not active 
fsp became effective when issued and will be adopted along with sfas beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year we will adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and that is expected to continue in the future 
the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as i the frequency of course events  ii the number of weeks during which courses can be conducted in a quarter  iii the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of and response to our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  iv the timing of the introduction of new course titles  v the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins  vi competitive forces within markets we serve  vii our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  viii currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  ix natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and x general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results also occur as a result of differences in the timing of our spending on the marketing and development of our courses 
see item a 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million to sales and marketing expense for use taxes due on catalogs as well as million of marketing expense that related to the third quarter 
also in the fourth quarter of we recorded a reduction in tax expense associated with a transfer pricing examination by the canada revenue agency and we released the deferred tax valuation allowance previously recorded for us entities 
see note liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents on hand of million at october  during fiscal year  the total of our cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
current available for sale securities decreased by million  reflecting net purchases of million of these securities during fiscal year  and the change in the classification of million to non current available for sale securities 
due to this reclassification  partly offset by net income and other factors  net working capital current assets minus current liabilities decreased million during the same time period 
cash flows 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at october  from million at september  fiscal year ended net change september  september  october  vs

the effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  primarily reflecting the decline in exchange rates for the british pound  euro and canadian dollar as applied to our international cash balances 

table of contents liquidity 
at october  our net working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million  a million decrease from our working capital balance at september  the change in net working capital was primarily due to the reclassification of million of auction rate securities ars to non current assets  and million in net purchases of available for sale securities 
this was partially offset by an increase to cash and cash equivalents of million 
excluding the reclassification of auction rate securities and the temporary impairment of auction rate securities discussed below  net working capital increased by million since the end of fiscal year we have no outstanding debt or line of credit agreements 
we anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on our balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations to finance our operating cash needs 
we believe that such funds will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
at october   we had million in face value of auction rate securities 
this compares to million in ars at september  our ars are long term debt instruments backed by municipal bonds and student loans 
none of our ars are mortgage backed debt 
all of our ars had credit ratings of aaa or aa when purchased 
historically  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rates every  or days to provide liquidity at par 
as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  it has been difficult to sell ars in the open market 
however  in fiscal year  we did sell million of our auction rate securities at their stated value 
also  in the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold an additional million of our auction rate securities at their stated value  including million which we sold to wachovia securities pursuant to a repurchase agreement 
we have also signed a repurchase agreement with ubs under which we have the right to sell our remaining million of auction rate securities at their stated value at any time during the period from june  through july  we do not believe that the failure of periodic auctions affects the value of the collateral underlying our ars  and there have been no defaults on the underlying collateral 
we continue to earn and receive interest at contractually set rates in a timely manner 
we can finance our operations even if our ars investments were to be illiquid for an extended period of time 
based on a valuation performed by an independent expert  houlihan smith company  inc houlihan smith  we concluded there was a temporary impairment of million in the fair value of our ars at the end of the second fiscal quarter on march  this valuation is updated at the end of each quarter 
at the end of the third fiscal quarter on june   they determined that the temporary impairment had declined to million 
at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter on october   houlihan smith determined that the temporary impairment had declined to million 
because we believe we will be able to redeem these securities at par in the foreseeable future  we do not consider the impairment to be other than temporary or to be permanent 
we recorded a reduction of million on an after tax basis for the impairment of the ars to other comprehensive income for our second quarter of in our third quarter of fiscal year  we revised our estimate of the temporary impairment in fair value and recorded an increase of on an after tax basis for a net year to date reduction of million on an after tax basis to other comprehensive income 
in our fourth quarter of fiscal year  we revised our estimate of the temporary impairment in fair value and recorded an increase of million on an after tax basis for a net year to date reduction of on an after tax basis to other comprehensive income 
because we have been unable to liquidate the remaining million of ars  and because of continued liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  we continue to classify these ars as non current assets as of october  capital requirements 
during fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of million for the purchase of equipment worldwide  mostly computers 
we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to accommodate any increased customer demand  to continue improving the quality and effectiveness of our course 
table of contents delivery  and to incorporate significant changes in technology 
we have a number of operating leases for our administrative offices and education center classroom facilities located worldwide 
these leases expire at various dates over the next years 
in addition to requiring monthly payments for rent  some of the leases contain asset retirement provisions whereby we are required to return the leased facility back to a specified condition at the expiration of the lease 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year fiscal years fiscal and years fiscal more than years fiscal operating leases i purchase commitments other lease contractual obligations ii total i amounts exclude future minimum sublease rental proceeds of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
ii represents estimated cash flows to satisfy contractual obligations to restore leased space to specified conditions at expiry of the leases 
amounts include million expected to be recovered from subtenants 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting estimates and policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting estimates and policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in a course is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the weighted average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport 
table of contents attendance rate is reviewed at least semi annually  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 
we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 
for newer passport products for which historical utilization data is not available  we assume that the estimated average number of courses to be attended is equal to the number of courses available on the passport 
this assumed utilization rate may be revised in future periods after sufficient time has passed to amass historical trends 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we use estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  based on our analysis of various factors  including our historical collection experience  current trends  specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful and a percentage of our past due accounts receivable 
although our estimates for this reserve have in the past been reasonably accurate  these estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment 
our trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
lease termination costs 
we lease education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements 
certain of these operating leases include space that is not used and which is currently subleased 
we calculate and record a liability related to those leases based on the difference between the present value of the net aggregate sublease rental income and the present value of the prime lease costs for the subleased space throughout the remaining term of the leases 
periodically  we evaluate the nature and extent of each of the individual provisions and make adjustments as appropriate  as new information becomes available or subsequent developments occur 
in  we entered into a year lease on a building in london to house our united kingdom education center 
this building has space in addition to that required for our current needs  which we attempt to sublet 
when space is vacant from time to time  we must estimate the fair value of the liability for the vacant space based upon the remaining lease costs as defined by our operating lease agreement reduced by estimated future sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property based upon prevailing real estate market conditions 
the computed long term portion of such liabilities is recorded as deferred facilities rent in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with the short term portion being recorded in other accrued liabilities 
amounts are paid under the master lease to the landlord  netted against subtenant sublease receipts  and applied to our accrued lease liability  reducing the amount of liability recorded with an offset to general and administrative expenses 

table of contents asset retirement obligations 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas which requires us to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated future cost to retire an asset 
for us  most asset retirement obligation aro liabilities are primarily associated with education facilities leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are obligated to remove in order to restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease agreement 
at the inception of such a lease  we record the aro as a liability and also record a leasehold improvement asset in an amount equal to the fair value of the liability 
the capitalized leasehold improvement asset is then depreciated on a straight line basis over years or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
any difference between the actual costs incurred for the eventual retirement and the estimated liability previously recorded will be recognized as a gain or loss in our statement of operations at the termination of the lease 
the fair value of any such aro liability is estimated in three steps the costs of leasehold restoration are estimated as if they were to be performed at the inception of the lease  the cost is forecast into the future by applying an inflation rate in effect at the time of adoption together with a market risk premium for a contractor s risk for performing the work in the future  and the present value of this future cost is computed by discounting it at our credit worthiness interest rate determined at the inception of the lease 
the aro liability is subsequently increased annually by interest accretion throughout the term of the lease 
in future periods we may also make adjustments to the aro liability as a result of the availability of new information  technology changes  changes in labor costs and other factors 
the estimate of aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
we cannot predict what revisions to these assumptions will be required in future periods 
the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
these include estimates for expected future cash flows related to contractual obligations  primarily to restore leased space back to open floor layouts as required by the lease agreements  our credit adjusted risk free rate that considers our estimated credit rating as of the date of lease inception  the market risk premium that we determine based on the length of the individual leases  and the relevant inflation factor in each affected country 
for the more significant aros we obtain third party restoration estimates specific to those leases 
we cannot predict the type of revisions to these assumptions that will be required in future periods due to the availability of additional information  technology changes  the price of labor costs and other factors 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
learning tree course events range from two to five days  with an average duration of approximately four days 
we use a or week fiscal year in order to better align our external financial reporting with the way we operate our business 
under this method  each fiscal quarter ends on the friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter 
since all courses have a duration of five days or less  and all courses begin and end within the same calendar week  under the or week fiscal year method all revenues and related direct costs for each course event are recognized in the week and the fiscal quarter in which the event takes place 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in a course is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the weighted average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed at least semi annually  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 

table of contents we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 
for newer passport products for which historical utilization data is not available  we assume that the estimated average number of courses to be attended is equal to the number of courses available on the passport 
this assumed utilization rate may be revised in future periods after sufficient time has passed to amass historical trends 
in addition to our learning tree training passports  we also offer a multiple course sales discount referred to as learning tree training vouchers 
with learning tree training vouchers  a customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a six to twelve month period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
if a training voucher has unused seats at the time of expiration of the voucher  we record the pro rata selling price of the expired unused seat as revenue 
at times we make a business decision to extend a voucher beyond the normal month expiration date 
to provide additional flexibility to meet our customers training needs  we offer a multiple training day sales discount referred to as learning tree day passes 
with learning tree day passes  a customer buys the right to take up to days of training over a one year period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance day 
if a day pass has unused days at expiration  we record the pro rata value of the unused days as revenue 
stock based compensation 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility  expected term  risk free interest rates  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we analyzed our historical volatility to estimate the expected volatility consistent with sfas r 
the risk free interest rate assumption is an average of the three and five year us treasury rates at the date of grant  which most closely resembles the four year expected life of our options 
the estimated expected life represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and has been determined based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated pre vesting forfeitures 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

table of contents long lived assets 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as equipment  property and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of long lived assets 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as of the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted fin the cumulative effect of the adoption was a million reduction to retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate if recognized 
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of the date of adoption  we had million accrued for interest and million accrued for penalties 
outlook effect of exchange rates 
one of the effects of the recent economic turmoil has been the substantial strengthening of the us dollar between mid august and now 
approximately half of our business annually is conducted in currencies other than us dollars and fluctuations in exchange rates will affect future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if the exchange rates of december  remain constant for the remainder of the first quarter of fiscal year  we would expect to report an unfavorable effect of approximately on our revenues during our first quarter of fiscal year compared to the same quarter of fiscal year we would also see a favorable  though lesser  effect on our expenses during that quarter 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates is somewhat less pronounced on operating expenses than on revenues and cost of sales primarily due to a greater proportion of dollar denominated corporate operating expenses  including corporate management and our centralized it  marketing and course development activities which are located here in the united states and which support our worldwide operations 
calendar effects 
in fiscal year  our first quarter began on september  and included weeks available for training  as the final week in that quarter was christmas week  in which we conducted no class events 
however in fiscal year  because of our week accounting convention  our first quarter began 
table of contents on october   and includes both christmas and new year s weeks 
our first quarter in fiscal year will therefore have only weeks during which we conduct class events  an effective reduction in available training time of approximately  which we expect will reduce our revenues in the quarter by between and compared to our first quarter last year 
revenues 
for our first quarter of fiscal year  we currently expect revenues to be between million and million  compared to revenues of million in our first quarter of fiscal year  a reduction of between and 
we expect approximately of that reduction to be attributable to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  and approximately to be attributable to the calendar placement of our first quarter in fiscal year the remaining reduction will be due to reduced sales compared to fiscal year  partly offset by the effect of price increases 
first quarter gross profit 
we expect a gross profit percentage in our first quarter of fiscal year of between and compared to in our first quarter of fiscal year the lower percentage will primarily result from allocating the fixed costs of our education centers and classroom equipment to fewer expected events in our first quarter of fiscal year than we held in our first quarter of fiscal year we expect to maintain about the same number of participants per event in our first quarter of fiscal year that we achieved in the same quarter of fiscal year first quarter operating expenses 
operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year will include million of expenses associated with the potential sale of the company and million associated with severance costs for the staff reductions previously discussed 
we expect overall operating expenses for our first quarter of fiscal year to be between million and million  a reduction of between and compared to million in the same quarter a year earlier 
we expect approximately of that reduction to be due to the expected effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  and another to be due to certain one time expenses we incurred in our first quarter of fiscal year which will not recur in our current quarter 
the one time expenses in our first quarter of fiscal year were primarily for professional services and consulting fees  and employee expenses related to stock option expense and severance 
in addition to the million of one time expenses noted above for our first quarter of fiscal year  annual salary increases that went into effect at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year will cause operating expenses to be about higher than the first quarter of fiscal year first quarter operating income 
as a result of the above factors  we expect first quarter operating income to be between million and million compared with operating income of million in the first quarter of fiscal year first quarter interest income 
we expect first quarter interest income of approximately million 
first quarter pre tax income 
overall  we expect to report pre tax income for our first quarter of fiscal year of between million and million  compared with pre tax income of million in the first quarter of the prior year 
effective tax rate 
our projected effective tax rate for our first quarter and full fiscal year is approximately 
fiscal year is a week year  and will have seven fewer calendar days than fiscal year on a quarterly basis  our fourth quarter of fiscal year will have weeks  compared to weeks in the same quarter in fiscal year our first  second  and third quarters of fiscal year will have weeks  the same as in fiscal year 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents and available for sale securities are diversified and consist primarily of investment grade securities of high quality financial institutions and corporations 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly affected by either a increase or decrease in the rates of interest due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in canada  the united kingdom  sweden and france 
for our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can have an impact on the united states dollar value of their reported earnings as well as on the intercompany transactions with the united states and other subsidiaries 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the united states dollar may have a significant impact on our reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into united states dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies in our major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits become lower or higher respectively 
a hypothetical appreciation of the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and swedish krona of would result in a million increase to our consolidated fiscal year results 
this was estimated using a appreciation factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to the net income or loss for each of our subsidiaries in the respective period 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can have an impact on the united states dollar amount of our stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate of the balance sheet for the respective reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
due to unfavorable changes in the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  the euro  the british pound and the swedish krona  the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income declined million during fiscal year additionally  we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency gains or losses due to short term intercompany transactions between the united states and its consolidated subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
these balances generated a foreign exchange loss of million in fiscal year to perform a sensitivity analysis  we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical change in the value of foreign currencies  assuming no change in interest rates 
as of october   the result of a uniform change in the values of foreign currency exchange rates against the united states dollar for intercompany exposures with all other variables held constant would be immaterial to our results of operations 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
in the future  we may undertake such transactions  however  any hedging techniques we might implement might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
see item a 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in available for sale securities  restricted interest bearing long term investments and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount 
table of contents of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies and government agencies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry  and no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues on an annual or quarterly basis 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for any potential credit losses related to our trade receivables 
we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies and we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as discussed in note and in the liquidity and capital resources section  we held million in auction rate securities at october  due to the turmoil in the worldwide credit markets since mid february  we were not able to sell these securities in the scheduled auctions that occur every  or days 
since the end of fiscal year  we have sold million of our auction rate securities that were redeemed at their stated value pursuant to a repurchase agreement signed with wachovia securities  and redeemed an additional million through tender calls at par 
we have also signed a repurchase agreement with ubs under which we have the right to sell our remaining million of auction rate securities at their stated value at any time during the period from june  through july
