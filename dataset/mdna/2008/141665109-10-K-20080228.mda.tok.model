our business overview we are a dynamic educational services company committed to quality  career focused learning and led by passionate professionals who inspire individual worth and lifelong achievement 
with approximately  students  we are one of the world s leading on ground providers of private  for profit  postsecondary education and have a substantial presence in online education 
our schools and universities prepare students for professionally and personally rewarding careers through the operation of more than on ground campuses located throughout the united states and in france  canada  italy  and the united kingdom and three fully online academic programs 
we evaluate our business based on our operating segments  which we define as our operating divisions 
each of our school and university operating divisions represents a group of for profit  postsecondary schools that offer a variety of degree and non degree academic programs and are differentiated based on a variety of criteria including  but not limited to  brand name  academic offerings  and geographic location 
as of december   we had six school reportable segments  consisting of academy  colleges  culinary arts  health education  international and university 
academy includes our international academy of design and technology iadt campuses that collectively offer academic programs primarily in the career oriented discipline of visual communications and design technologies in an online  classroom or laboratory setting 
colleges includes schools that collectively offer academic programs in our core career oriented disciplines of business studies  health education  information technology  and visual communications and design technologies in a classroom or laboratory setting 
culinary arts includes our le cordon bleu lcb and kitchen academy schools that collectively offer culinary arts programs in the career oriented disciplines of culinary arts  baking and pastry arts  and hotel and restaurant management primarily in a classroom or kitchen setting 
health education primarily includes our sanford brown schools that collectively offer academic programs in the career oriented disciplines of health education  business studies  visual communications and design technologies  and information technology in a classroom or laboratory setting

overview 
was a year of considerable change for us  including the addition of new senior management  including  president and chief executive officer  gary e 
mccullough  executive vice president and chief financial officer  michael j 
graham  senior vice president  general counsel  jeffrey d 
ayers  senior vice president and chief marketing and admissions officer  leonard a 
mariani  and senior vice president organization effectiveness and administration  thomas g 
budlong  along with other key positions  the acquisition of istituto marangoni in january we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of istituto marangoni for million 
istituto marangoni is a world renowned postsecondary fashion and design school with locations in milan  london and paris 
the acquisition expands our european operations and marks our entry into the italian market  in december  we announced that aiu had been removed from probation by the commission on colleges of the southern association of colleges and schools sacs 
sacs placed aiu on probation in december  setting in motion extensive actions taken by aiu to meet the accrediting agency s concerns  favorable outcomes in a number of regulatory and legal matters 
in january  we were notified by the us department of education ed that it had lifted restrictions it imposed in june that had prevented us from acquiring domestic schools and opening additional branch campuses of our existing domestic schools 
in march  the united states district court for the northern district of illinois dismissed the amended complaint in mcsparran v 
larson  et al  a stockholder derivative suit  and  in april  the court dismissed the third amended consolidated complaint in the in re career education corporation securities litigation  a securities class action suit 
in addition  the us department of justice in chicago notified us on april   that it was declining prosecution and closing its grand jury investigation of us  the enhancement of controls and procedures throughout our operations to ensure quality performance and adherence to regulatory and ethical standards  and the alignment of the our future actions around five strategic choices grow our core educational institutions  enter new markets  improve academic and operational effectiveness  build our reputation and external relationships  and grow and develop our people 
total revenue from continuing operations during was billion  a decrease of million  or  from total revenue during of billion 
operating income during was million  a decrease of million  or  from operating income during of million 
income from continuing operations during was million  or per diluted share  compared to income from continuing operations during of million  or per diluted share  an increase of million  or 
the decline in our operating results represents a continuation of declining operating performance experienced in recent periods  which has been influenced by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the continued probation status of our aiu schools  which was eventually lifted in december  general competitive pressures for student leads and enrollments experienced by some of our schools  the ed s general restrictions on our ability to open new branch campuses  which were eventually lifted in january  the continued negative impact of legal and regulatory matters  and the related negative publicity and negative press coverage regarding us and certain of our schools 
in addition  the current year operating results include expenses of approximately million related to the probable settlement of certain legal matters 
operating income as a percentage of total revenue from continuing operations declined from during to during the decrease in operating profit margin percentage during was primarily attributable to disproportionately larger revenue declines in our university segment  which produced the highest operating profit margins during  a decrease in operating profit margin percentage generated by our university segment  driven primarily by a decline in revenue  caused  in part  by declining aiu student population and price reductions within our aiu online associate degree programs  an increase in administrative expenses  and the disproportionate growth of ctu online associate degree programs  and increased occupancy expense and other fixed costs as a percentage of revenue due to declines in revenue 
operating income in both and was impacted by impairment charges for long lived assets 
during  we recorded a million impairment charge related to writing down certain of our tangible assets to their respective fair value as a result of the decision to teach out our academy segment s iadt toronto  canada and iadt pittsburgh  pa schools  as well as the colleges segment s brooks college campuses 
during  we recorded million of impairment charges related to the write down of goodwill and assets within the health education segment and the impairment of tangible assets within the colleges segment 
we expect to continue to be a period of significant transition and renewal 
while our results continue to be negatively affected by a number of near term factors  including cash and non cash charges related to the teach out of underperforming schools and the significant change in student lending markets  we believe that the steps we have taken to realign and refocus our business will both position us in the short term as an innovative leader in the delivery of high quality postsecondary education and allow us to cost effectively leverage our assets to build long term value 
we continue to be committed to delivering value over the long term to our students  employees  and stockholders 
current business and industry opportunities  challenges  and risks in addition to the risk factors discussed in part i  item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  we have identified a number of key factors and trends related to our business and industry that represent opportunities  challenges  and risks 
sale plan for certain of our schools and campuses 
as of december   we were in negotiations with a potential buyer to sell all or some of the schools and campuses held for sale at that time 
the plan included the anticipated sale of our nine gibbs division campuses  which collectively comprised our entire gibbs reportable segment  mcintosh college mcintosh and lehigh valley college lehigh 
as of december   the plan also included two campuses of brooks college 
in june  we decided to retain the two campuses of brooks college and teach out these campuses because we were not able to identify a suitable buyer that we believed would support the best interests of the campus students and faculty 
the two campuses of brooks college are no longer held for sale and the results of operations of brooks college are no longer reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our two brooks college campuses are no longer included in current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
all current and prior period financial statements and the related notes included herein have been restated to include the results of operations and financial position of brooks college in the colleges segment of our continuing operations 
on february   we announced plans to teach out all programs at mcintosh college  lehigh valley college and seven of the campuses that were part of the gibbs division  gibbs colleges in cranston  ri  boston  ma  livingston and piscataway  nj  and norwalk  ct  and katharine gibbs schools in new york  ny and norristown  pa 
each campus will employ a gradual teach out process  enabling it to continue to operate while current students complete their programs 
the campuses will no longer enroll new students 
the other two schools held for sale at december   gibbs college vienna  va and katharine gibbs school  melville  ny will remain with us 
the campuses will be converted to sanford brown schools focusing on allied health programs 
the results of operations for these two schools will be reported within the health segment 
our results included a million charge  net of income tax benefit of million  to write down to fair value the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets of the campuses held for sale as of december  the results of operations of the schools and campuses included in the sale plan have been classified as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations and note subsequent events of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting for discontinued operations 
impact of sallie mae financing decision 
on january   we received notification that sallie mae would be terminating its recourse loan program with us  and more broadly within all of the postsecondary education market 
sallie mae also notified us that while it intends to continue their non recourse programs with us  sallie mae is also reviewing various aspects of such programs  including underwriting criteria 
sallie mae agreed to extend the recourse loan program past the day termination period to march  during the extension period the discount fee on loans certified during that period increases from to 
our efforts to work with sallie mae to arrange continued funding for active students that currently utilize sallie mae recourse loans past march  were not successful 
we were notified by sallie mae on february  that it would no longer continue to offer recourse to existing students entering their second or subsequent academic term 
we are working with third parties as well as internally to implement a funding program that will assist these students in continuing their program of study 
we have estimated that up to million of annual revenue was related to programs provided to new students who are impacted by the sallie mae decision to terminate its recourse loan program 
students attending cec schools and universities retain the option to work with sallie mae to secure federal family education loan ffel program and non recourse loans 
we believe that we have the financial ability with our balance sheet and credit line to meet the obligations of any of the alternatives being considered

also included in educational services and facilities expense are costs of other goods and services provided by our schools  including  among other things  costs of textbooks  laptop computers  dormitory services  restaurant services  contract training and cafeteria services 
general and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits of personnel in corporate and school administration  marketing  admissions  financial aid  accounting  human resources  legal and compliance 
costs of promotion and development  advertising and production of marketing materials  occupancy of the corporate offices and bad debt expense are also included in this expense category

health education segment student starts exclude sbi springfield  ma  which was taught out in september academy segment student starts exclude iadt pittsburgh  pa and iadt toronto  canada  which are currently being taught out 
in january  we purchased istituto marangoni 
the results of its operations are included in our consolidated results from january  forward 
total revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or from the overall decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to decreases in revenue generated by the university and colleges segment  offset  in part  by increases in revenue generated by our culinary arts  health education  academy and international segments 
university segment revenue 
the university segment revenue decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in average revenue per student as well as a decline in average population as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in average revenue per student was attributable to a population mix change that included an increase in ctu students  which has a lower revenue per student than aiu  and an increase in students in our university segment s fully online associate degree programs  which offer lower tuition rates than those of our university segment s fully online bachelor s degree and master s degree programs 
the increase in online associate degree seeking students was a result of a pricing reduction in our aiu online associate programs and strong student population growth at ctu online 
the decline in average population was driven by a decline in average population for both aiu online and on ground being partially offset by an increase in the average ctu online population 
we believe that the declines in the aiu student population and student starts are primarily attributable to the continuing effects of the sacs probation status  which was lifted in december the sacs probation status that remained in place during the majority of the academic school year negatively impacted those schools ability to recruit new students 
the effects of the sacs probation status resulted in a decrease in student population and revenue at each of our aiu universities 
the combined revenue for our university segment schools fully online platforms  including aiu online and ctu online decreased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  culinary arts revenue 
the culinary arts segment revenue increased slightly primarily due to an increase in student enrollments and student starts during  relative to student starts enrollments and student starts during colleges revenue 
the colleges segment revenue decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in student population as well as a decline in student starts and enrollments during as compared to we believe that revenue has also been negatively impacted by certain legal and regulatory matters and the related negative publicity  negative press coverage regarding certain of our colleges segment schools  and general competitive pressures for student leads and enrollments experienced by certain of our colleges segment schools 
health education revenue 
the health education segment revenue increase is primarily attributable to tuition price increases affected during  an increase in average student population during  relative to average student population during  a continued strengthening in student enrollments at our health education segment schools  and a shift in student enrollment mix that resulted in higher average revenue per student 
academy revenue 
the academy segment revenue increase is primarily attributable to an increase in average student population and student starts during  relative to average student population and student starts during international revenue 
the international segment revenue increase is primarily attributable to revenue of million generated by istituto marangoni  which we acquired in january  and a million increase in our inseec schools revenues during as a result of an increase in average student population during  relative to average student population during of the million increase in international segment revenues  approximately million was the result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the continued weakness in the us dollar in comparison to the eurodollar and the british pound sterling 
educational services and facilities expense the increase in educational services and facilities expense is primarily attributable to million of istituto marangoni costs included in as a result of their acquisition in january  increased occupancy costs across most of our segments and increased academic costs primarily within our international and culinary segments 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in other student related expenses  including the costs of laptop computers  textbooks  and other program materials  attributable to decreases in student population at most of our schools during the increase in the international segment educational services and facilities expense in addition to the istituto marangoni costs was primarily due to an increase in average student population in  relative to average student population in the increase in the culinary arts segment educational services and facilities expense is primarily attributable to a million increase in recourse loan fees and a million increase in occupancy expense primarily as a result of an increase in incremental costs associated with lcb  kitchen academy and four start up campuses during the increase in the academy segment educational services and facilities expense is primarily attributable to a million increase in academics expense and a million increase in occupancy expense primarily as a result of a larger average student population in  relative to  and the incremental expenses associated with the two iadt start up campuses in general and administrative expense the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in admissions  advertising and bad debt expenses incurred by our university segment and a decrease in administrative and admissions expense in corporate and other  partially offset by increases in the academy  culinary arts  health education and international segments 
the decrease in university segment administrative expenses during is primarily attributable to a million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of a decline in aiu student population and related student receivables and improved cash collections experience  a million decrease in admissions expense associated with admission headcount reductions along with lower average student population  and a million decrease in advertising costs as a result of a planned reduction in advertising spending based upon strategic initiatives utilizing a target marketing approach and more effective media sources 
the increases in administrative  advertising  marketing and admissions costs incurred by our academy segment  health education segment and culinary arts segment schools are primarily attributable to variable costs incurred to support an increase in student enrollments and starts 
the increase in the international segment is primarily attributable to million in general and administrative expenses incurred by istituto marangoni  which we acquired in january bad debt expense incurred by each of our reportable segments during the years ended december  and  was as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change of segment revenue of segment revenue vs 
bad debt expense by segment university segment culinary arts segment colleges segment health education segment academy segment international segment corporate and other n a  n a total bad debt expense the overall decrease in bad debt expense during is primarily attributable to a decrease in overall student receivable exposure at a majority of our schools  overall improvement in student retention  and improvement in our collections experience 
goodwill and asset impairment during  we recorded approximately million in asset impairment charges related to the reduction in asset carrying values for certain campuses within our colleges and academy segments  which are currently being taught out 
in  we recorded approximately million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to our health education segment and approximately million in asset impairment charges related to a reduction in asset values of our brooks campuses

as discussed above  we believe that the declines in university segment operating profit and operating profit margin percentage are primarily attributable to the negative effects of the sacs probation status of the university segment s aiu universities and increased competition 
aiu online s operating profit margin percentage declined from during to during as discussed above  declines in aiu online operations and student population had a disproportionately negative impact on overall university segment and cec consolidated operating profits and operating profit margin percentages 
operating profit and operating profit margin percentage information for the years ended december  and  for our university segments universities  including the universities online platforms  were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands operating profit loss on ground universities online platforms aiu online  ctu online  and stonecliffe college online combined total university segment operating profit operating profit loss margin percentage on ground universities online platforms aiu online  ctu online  and stonecliffe college online combined total university segment operating profit margin percentage aiu online ctu online and stonecliffe college online other income  net the increase in other income  net is primarily due to increased earnings from our au dubai affiliate along with a decrease in interest expense driven by lower average borrowings in the current year 
see note subsequent events of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our au dubai affiliate 
provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
the effective income tax rate for was attributable to the fact that only million of the total million health education segment goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized during were deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of these charges  our effective income tax rate for would have been 
we identify items that are not normal and recurring in nature and treat these as discrete events 
the tax effect of discrete items is booked entirely in the period in which the discrete event occurs 
additionally  tax legislation and tax examinations in the jurisdictions in which we do business may change our effective tax rate in future periods 
while such changes cannot be predicted  if they occur  the impact on our tax assets  obligations and liquidity will need to be measured and recognized in the financial statements 
loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations decreased million  or  from million during  to million during the loss from discontinued operations included goodwill and asset impairment charges of million  net of income tax benefit of million  and million  net of income tax benefit of million  for the years ended december  and  respectively

the overall decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to decreases in revenue generated by the university segment  the culinary art segment  and colleges segment  offset  in part  by increases in revenue generated by our health education segment  academy segment  and international segment 
the overall decline in revenue was caused primarily by decreases in student starts and student population during  but our revenue growth prospects were also hindered to a certain degree by our inability to open new branch campuses or acquire domestic campuses as a result of restrictions imposed on us by the ed 
these restrictions were lifted by the ed in january university segment revenue 
the overall university segment revenue decrease was primarily attributable to declines in student population and student starts during we believe the declines in university segment student population and student starts were primarily attributable to the effects of the ongoing sacs probation status of our aiu universities  which was announced by sacs on december   extended by sacs for one year on december   and continued to negatively impact our university segment schools ability to recruit new students 
the adverse effect of the sacs probation status  accompanied by increased competition  has resulted in a decrease in student population and revenue at each of our aiu universities and most dramatically impacted the operating results of aiu online  one of our most profitable businesses 
also  contributing  in part  to the decline in revenue was the impact of the aiu online associate degree program price reductions introduced during the third quarter of the decrease in university segment revenue associated with decreases in aiu revenue during was offset  in part  by an increase in revenue generated by our university segment s ctu online platform 
the increase in ctu online revenue was primarily due to an increase in ctu online student population during relative to ctu online student population during ctu online s student population growth was primarily attributable to its broadening penetration of the expanding online education market through increased investment in marketing activities and recruiting efforts and an expansion of program offerings and online platforms 
modest improvements in university segment student retention during also contributed positively to university segment revenue 
the combined revenue for our university segment schools fully online platforms  including aiu online and ctu online decreased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  culinary arts segment revenue 
the culinary arts segment revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in culinary arts segment schools average student population during  relative to culinary arts segment schools average student population during the decrease in average student population during was primarily attributable to declines in culinary arts segment conversion rates and show rates during we believe that the declines in conversion rates and start rates during were caused  in part  by strict credit standards implemented by all our schools to mitigate our bad debt exposure 
the existence of strict credit standards effectively limit the number of prospective culinary arts students who qualify for certain private financing options 
the strict credit standards generally have had a more significant effect on our culinary arts segment schools because these schools typically offer higher priced academic programs relative to academic programs offered by our other segment s schools 
during the third quarter of  we implemented changes in the credit standards for all of our schools students 
these changes  while in compliance with our overall principles of fiscal responsibility  were intended to mitigate  in part  the negative effects of our original tightening of credit standards for all schools 
colleges segment revenue 
the colleges segment revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in student population for our colleges segment schools during  a decline in colleges segment student starts during compared to colleges segment student starts during  and a continuation of weak operating performance experienced in recent periods by a many of our colleges segment schools 
we believe that the weak operating performance experienced by many of our colleges segment schools was primarily attributable to the continued negative impact of certain legal and regulatory matters and the related negative publicity  negative press coverage regarding certain of our colleges segment schools  and general competitive pressures for student leads and enrollments experienced by certain of our colleges segment schools 
health education segment revenue 
the health education segment revenue increase was primarily attributable to a modest increase in average student population during  which we believe was a result of changes in our credit standards for all schools implemented during the third quarter of  a strengthening of student starts at certain of our health education segment schools  and a shift in student enrollment mix that resulted in higher average revenue per student 
educational services and facilities expense the increase in educational services and facilities expense was primarily attributable to an overall increase in certain academic and occupancy costs incurred by our university segment schools  offset  in part  by decreases in other student related expenses  including the costs of laptop computers  textbooks  and other program materials  attributable to decreases in student population at most of our schools during the increase in university segment educational services and facilities expense was primarily attributable to increases in variable expenses incurred by ctu online necessary to support increases in student population 
the increase was also attributable to costs related to additional student service activities designed to improve retention  an increase in costs associated with curriculum development activities  and increased occupancy costs associated with facility expansions in support of university segment online platforms during and increases in occupancy costs incurred by our health education segment schools and culinary arts segment schools during in connection with recent facility expansions also contributed to the overall increase in education services and facilities expenses during the increase in educational services and facilities expenses during was mitigated  in part  by the continuation of cost cutting measures enacted during in response to the overall declines in average student population at a majority of our campuses 
general and administrative expense this increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in administrative  advertising  marketing and admissions costs incurred by our university  health education and culinary arts segment schools  and approximately million of share based compensation expense recognized during in connection with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the increase in university segment administrative expenses during the period was primarily attributable to costs incurred by aiu in connection with the university s efforts to remediate its probation status with its accrediting body 
the increase in university segment administrative expense was also attributable to increases in variable administrative costs incurred by ctu in response to increased student enrollments during the period 
the increase in university segment advertising  marketing  and admissions costs during the period was primarily attributable to costs incurred by ctu online in support of increased student lead  enrollment  and start volume 
the increases in administrative  advertising  marketing  and admissions costs incurred by our health education segment and culinary arts segment schools were primarily attributable to variable costs incurred to support student enrollments and starts 
the increases in general and administrative expenses during were also attributable to additional employee salary and benefit costs incurred during in connection with our accounting  financial aid processing and cash collections centralization efforts and increases in employee headcount within our corporate and school compliance departments and our corporate internal audit and legal departments 
additionally  included in general and administrative expenses during were charges of approximately million and million  respectively  attributable to future cash severance payments due to our former chairman and share based compensation expense recorded in connection with modifications made during the fourth quarter of to certain options held by our former chairman 
the increase in general and administrative expense discussed above was offset  in part  by an overall decrease in bad debt expense during of approximately million 
bad debt expense incurred by each of our reportable segments during the years ended december  and  was as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change of segment revenue of segment revenue vs 
bad debt expense by segment university segment culinary arts segment colleges segment health education segment academy segment international segment corporate and other  n a  n a total bad debt expense the overall decrease in bad debt expense during was primarily attributable to a decrease in overall student receivable exposure at a majority of our schools  primarily as a result of declines in student population during the period  overall improvement in student retention  and improvement in our collections experience 
the university segment schools generally experience higher bad debt expense levels than those of our other schools due primarily to the historically lower student retention rates at our university segment schools online platforms 
lower student retention generally results in a shift in the relative distribution of student receivables balances from in school student receivables to out of school student receivables 
out of school student receivable balances generally pose a greater credit risk than do in school student receivables and are subject to higher bad debt allowance percentages 
the increase in overall general and administrative expenses during was mitigated  in part  by the continuation of cost cutting measures enacted during in response to the overall declines in average student population at a majority of our campuses 
goodwill and asset impairment during  we recognized million in goodwill and asset impairment charges  of which million was attributable to our health education segment

also contributing to our decrease in operating profit during was non cash share based compensation expense of million incurred in connection with our adoption of sfas r  and the declines in university segment operating profit and operating profit margin percentage 
as discussed above  we believe that the declines in university segment operating profit and operating profit margin percentage were primarily attributable to the negative effects of the sacs probation status of the university segment s aiu universities and increased competition

the increased interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and a general increase in short term interest rates during provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate of reflected in our statement of income during was attributable to the fact that only million of our total million health education segment goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge  which is included in operating expenses  was deductible for income tax purposes

we reduced our effective income tax rate from during to during  excluding the effect of the non deductible health education segment goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 
the decrease in our effective tax rate was attributable to the impact of various tax planning strategies  favorable changes in the proportionate distribution of our total pretax income among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate  and an increase in tax exempt interest earned on invested cash balances 
future changes in the proportionate distribution of our total pretax income among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate may further impact our effective income tax rate

summary of significant accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our schools 
we generally segregate our revenue into two categories  tuition and registration fees and other 
tuition and registration fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our schools 
we generally bill a student for tuition and registration fees at the beginning of an academic term  and we recognize the tuition and registration fees as revenue on a straight line basis over the academic term  which includes any applicable externship period 
the portion of tuition and registration fees payments received from students but not earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet  as such amount represents revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term  we refund the portion of tuition and registration fees already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
our schools academic year is generally at least weeks in length but varies both by school and program of study and is divided by academic terms 
academic terms are determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending on the school and on the type of program and specific curriculum 
our students finance tuition costs through a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships  and cash payments 
other revenue consists of  among other things  bookstore sales  student laptop computer sales  dormitory revenue  restaurant revenue  contract training revenue  and cafeteria revenue 
revenue from dormitory and cafeteria services is generally billed to a student at the beginning of an academic term and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenue  as well as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  restaurant revenue  and contract training revenue  is billed and recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
certain of our schools bill students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies 
such billings  which we treat as a single accounting unit are recognized as tuition and registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit for tuition to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our schools 
based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
our standard allowance estimation methodology considers a number of factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on students credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source for example  federal loan or grant  state grant  private loan  student cash payments  etc  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study  and our overall collections history 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 
we monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables from operations as of december   would have resulted in a change in income from continuing operations of million during the year then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 
contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies  including  but not limited to  settlement of legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters  when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these matters 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results and cash flows and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
we monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment considerations and related charges we recognized during the year ended december  long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
discontinued operations we account for discontinued operations  including our schools and campuses currently held for sale  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the net assets of assets held for sale are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
the results of operations of discontinued operations are segregated from those of continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income 
see note discontinued operations and note subsequent events of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting for discontinued operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of sfas fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the initial application of fin to our tax positions had no effect on our stockholders equity 
liquidity  financial position  and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaled million 
our cash flows from operations have historically been adequate to fulfill our liquidity requirements 
we finance our operating activities and our organic growth primarily through cash generated from operations 
we finance acquisitions primarily through funding from credit facility borrowings and cash generated from operations 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with  among other things  our working capital needs  capital expenditures  and lease commitments through at least the next months primarily with cash generated by operations  existing cash balances  and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing credit agreements 
the ed requires that title iv program funds collected in advance of student billings be kept in a separate cash account until students are billed for the portion of their program related to those title iv program funds collected 
the ed further requires that title iv program funds be disbursed to students within three business days of receipt 
we do not recognize restricted cash balances on our consolidated balance sheet until all restrictions have lapsed with respect to those balances 
as of december  and  the amount of restricted cash balances recorded in separate cash accounts was not significant 
restrictions on cash balances have not affected  nor do we believe that such restrictions will affect  our ability to fund our daily operations 
sources and uses of cash operating cash flows during the year ended december  and  net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million and million  respectively 
our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is tuition collected from our students 
our students finance tuition costs through the use of a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships and cash payments 
the following table summarizes our us schools cash receipts from tuition payments by fund source as a percentage of total tuition payments received for the years ended december    and the percentages reflected therein were determined based upon our us schools cash receipts for the month period ended december for the year ended december  title iv program funding stafford loans grants plus loans total title iv program funding private loans non recourse loans sallie mae recourse loans stillwater recourse loans total private loans scholarships  grants and other cash payments total tuition receipts the total title iv program funding as a percentage of total tuition receipts reflected above was not computed on the same basis on which our rule ratios are computed 
in accordance with applicable regulations  certain tuition receipts included in the totals above were excluded from our rule ratio calculations 
for further discussion of title iv program funding and alternative private loan funding sources for our students  see student financial aid and alternative student financial aid sources in part i  item business of this annual report on form k 
our primary uses of cash to support our operating activities include  among other things  cash paid to employees for services  to vendors for products and services  to lessors for rents and operating costs related to leased facilities  to suppliers for textbooks and other school supplies  and to federal  state  and provincial governments for income and other taxes 
although we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy cash requirements for working capital needs  capital expenditures  and commitments through at least the next year primarily with cash generated by our operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing credit agreements  we are not able to assess the effect of loss contingencies on future cash requirements and liquidity 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these matters 
investing cash flows during the year ended december   net cash flows provided by investing activities totaled million compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  capital expenditures

under our us credit agreement  we may borrow up to the us dollar equivalent of million in us dollars and various foreign currencies under a revolving credit facility 
under our us credit agreement  we may borrow up to the us dollar equivalent of million in standby letters of credit in us dollars 
outstanding letters of credit were approximately million as of december   and reduced the availability of borrowings under the revolving credit facility  but are not included in the table above

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments is primarily attributable to cash flows provided by the net sale of available for sale investments and cash flows generated during operations  offset  in part  by cash outflows used for the acquisition of istituto marangoni and the repurchase of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program 
student receivables 
the increase in net student receivables is primarily attributable to an overall increase in student starts and student population in in comparison to our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables and days sales outstanding dso from operations as of and for the twelve months ended december    and were as follows as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables dso in days we calculate dso by dividing net receivables  including both student receivables and other receivables  by annual average daily revenue 
annual average daily revenue is computed by dividing total revenue for the twelve months ended december  by days 
the increase in dso to days as of december  as compared with days as of december   resulted from lower average revenue per day  which was partially offset by a higher net receivable balance in comparison to the prior year 
allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables decreased as of december  from december  due primarily to a higher gross receivable balance in comparison to the prior year 
other current assets 
the decrease in other current assets is primarily attributable to a decrease in our tenant improvement allowance receivable during the reduction was the result of the recognition of these tenant improvement allowances by our lessors as we made leasehold improvements to certain of our facilities during goodwill 
the increase in goodwill is primarily attributable to our acquisition of istituto marangoni 
on january   we acquired of the issued and outstanding common stock of istituto marangoni for approximately million 
deferred tuition revenue 
the increase in deferred tuition revenue is primarily attributable to approximately a million balance in deferred tuition revenue as a result of the istituto marangoni acquisition in january and an increase in deferred tuition balances in our inseec group schools in the international segments as a result of an increase in student population during  relative to student population in the increase in deferred tuition revenue was partially offset by a decrease in our culinary arts segment as a result of the timing of student starts 
deferred rent obligations 
the increase in deferred rent obligations is primarily attributable to tenant improvement allowances due or received from lessors during the year ended december   and normal increases in deferred rent obligations associated with lease arrangements with escalating rent payments 
share based awards subject to redemption 
as discussed in note share based compensation of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  a participant in our share based compensation plans has the right  or may be granted the right  upon occurrence of a change in control event  to surrender all or part of his or her stock option awards to us in exchange for cash 
upon our adoption of sfas r as of january   the grant date cash redemption value of each outstanding stock option award is recorded as share based awards subject to redemption on our consolidated balance sheets on a pro rata basis over the requisite service period 
the total grant date cash redemption value for each outstanding stock option award represents the intrinsic value of the stock option award as of the grant date  assuming that a change in control event occurred on the grant date 
share based awards subject to redemption as of december   recorded upon our adoption of sfas r as a reduction of retained earnings with no effect on income  represents the portion of the total grant date cash redemption value for all stock option awards outstanding as of december   earned by plan participants as a result of services rendered through such date 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  we were not required to record an amount for share based awards subject to redemption on our consolidated balance sheet 
treasury stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million at an average price of approximately per share 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors adopted a resolution to retire approximately million shares of our treasury stock 
the retirement of our treasury shares effectively reduces the number of shares of our common stock issued and also reduces the number of shares of our common stock held as treasury shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use various techniques to manage our market risk  including  from time to time  the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate exposure our borrowings under our credit agreements bear annual interest at variable rates tied to the prime rate and the eurocurrency rate 
the outstanding borrowings under these credit agreements were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we estimate that the book value of our investments  debt instruments  and any derivative financial instruments approximated their fair values as of december  and we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates is not significant 
foreign currency exposure we are subject to foreign currency exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into us dollar balance sheet accounts 
specifically  we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the value of the euro  the canadian dollar  and the british pound vis vis the us dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of december   was not significant  and the book values of the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations as of december   approximated their fair values 
in addition  as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under our us credit agreement of million denominated in million 
we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not significant
