the company s principal business activities are overseeing and directing the business of the bank and investing the net stock offering proceeds retained by the company 
the company s assets consist primarily of the outstanding capital stock of the bank  deposits held at the bank  and investment securities 
the bank s principal business activity is offering fdic insured deposit accounts to local customers through its branch offices and investing those deposits  together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  in residential and nonresidential real estate loans  construction loans  commercial business loans  consumer loans  investment securities  and mortgage backed securities 
the bank also acts as a broker in both the origination of loans secured by one to four family residences and in the sale of uninsured financial products see item business of this report 
our primary business strategy since our initial public stock offering in has been to transform the bank from a traditional savings bank to a full service community bank  offering a complete array of both commercial and retail loan and deposits  wealth management services  mortgage banking activities  brokerage services  and other related financial services 
in executing this strategy  the company has concentrated much of its lending efforts on nonresidential real estate and construction loans  originated substantially all fixed rate one to four family residential loans as a broker for a third party  and focused its deposit gathering efforts on core deposits demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts 
as a result  nonresidential real estate and construction loans comprised approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december   compared to approximately at december  also  during the same period  the company s portfolio of one to four family residential loans decreased from of the company s loan portfolio at december   to of the company s loan portfolio at december  core deposits have increased as a percentage of total deposits from at december  to at december  management expects to continue to execute this business strategy in on october   the company consummated the merger of trinity bank trinity into citizens south bank 
at the time of the acquisition  trinity had total assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million  borrowed money of million and equity of million 
trinity was headquartered in monroe  north carolina  which is approximately miles east of the company s headquarters 
trinity had three offices located in union county  north carolina  which had the fastest population growth of any county in north carolina based on the most current information available at the time of the acquisition 
the combined bank had full service locations and ranked th in the charlotte metropolitan statistical area in deposit market share as of december  under the terms of the merger agreement  the company issued a combination of common stock and cash for the outstanding common shares of trinity bank 
trinity shareholders were given the option of receiving shares of citizens south common stock for each share of trinity common stock  in cash for each share of trinity common stock  or a mixture of stock and cash for each trinity share  such that of the shares of trinity common stock will be exchanged for citizens south common stock 
on october   trinity shareholders received merger consideration of approximately  shares of common stock of the company subject to payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares and approximately million in cash including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares  resulting in a total transaction value of approximately million 
the transaction price represented approximately of trinity s book value 
additional information regarding this transaction may be obtained by reviewing the registration statement that the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on august   and amended september  in order to provide financing for the cash portion of the trinity acquisition  on october   the company completed a private placement of an aggregate amount of million in trust preferred securities  liquidation amount of  per security the preferred securities  through a newly formed delaware statutory trust subsidiary  csbc statutory trust i the trust 
in connection with the issuance of the preferred securities  on october   the company entered into an indenture by and between the company and wilmington trust company  as trustee 
the preferred securities mature on december   but may be redeemed beginning december   if the company exercises its rights to redeem the debentures 
the preferred securities require quarterly interest payments to the holders of the preferred securities  initially at a fixed rate of through december  and thereafter at a variable rate of three month libor plus  reset quarterly 
additional information regarding the preferred securities may be obtained by reviewing the form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on november  the bank s results of operations are heavily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also materially affected by the bank s provision for loan losses  noninterest income  and noninterest expense 
noninterest income includes fee income generated from deposit and loan accounts  mortgage banking fees  commissions earned from the sale of uninsured investment products  increases in the cash value of bank owned life insurance policies  net gains losses from the sale of assets and other noninterest income 
the bank s noninterest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  professional services  advertising  amortization of intangible assets and other noninterest expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in interest rates  and actions of regulatory and governmental authorities 
certain actions were taken that adversely impacted our results of operations for the years ended december  and in we acquired trinity bank  resulting in merger and computer conversion related expenses of  additional merger and conversion expenses totaling  were incurred in net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the earnings resulted in a return on average equity of in  compared to in  and a return on average assets of in  compared to in management s discussion and analysis is provided to assist in understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries

critical accounting policies the accounting and financial policies of the company and its subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
we consider accounting policies that require significant judgment and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
based on the size of the item or significance of the estimate  the following accounting policies are considered critical to our financial results 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb estimated probable loan losses inherent in the bank s portfolio at the measurement date 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires an estimate of the loss for each type of loan and for each impaired loan  an estimate of the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows  and an estimate of the value of the collateral 
the company has not been an originator or purchaser of option adjustable rate or no documentation portfolio loans and the company s loan portfolio does not include any mortgage loans that are considered sub prime 
management has established a systematic method for periodically evaluating the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish an allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and includes a review of all loans in the portfolio on which full collectibility may or may not be reasonably assured 
the loan review considers among other matters  the estimated fair value of the collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  our knowledge of inherent losses in the portfolio that are probable and reasonable estimable and other factors that warrant recognition in providing an appropriate loan loss allowance 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectibility 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because this evaluation involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
management periodically reviews all investment securities with significant declines in fair value for potential other than temporary impairment pursuant to the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fsp addressed the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also included accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amended sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and apb opinion  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
effective june   management evaluated the company s investment portfolio and determined that a  other than temporary impairment existed on a  equity investment in a closely held company 
the impairment was considered to be other than temporary due to the closely held company s continuing operating losses and deteriorating book value 
the company s remaining equity interest in the closely held company amounts to  effective december   management evaluated the company s investment portfolio and determined that all unrealized losses were the direct result of temporary changes in interest rates and that such losses may be recovered in the foreseeable future 
the company has the ability to hold these investments to maturity if necessary in order to recover any temporary losses that may presently exist 
as a result  management did not consider any additional unrealized losses as other than temporary as of december  comparison of financial condition for the years ended december  and total assets increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the majority of this growth was due to a million  or  increase in outstanding loans from million at december   to million at december  most of the company s loan growth was in loans secured by commercial real estate 
during  these loans  which include construction loans  multifamily residential loans  and nonresidential real estate loans  increased by million  or  to million at december  these loans are typically secured by owner occupied professional office buildings  retail properties  churches  speculative residential properties  or residential subdivisions located in the charlotte  north carolina metropolitan area  which is the company s primary lending area 
management does not generally pursue commercial real estate loans that are secured by hotels  motels  golf courses  or resort properties 
management plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial real estate loans in the company s primary lending area 
also during  the company s portfolio of one to four family residential loans decreased from million to million due to normal prepayments and principal amortization 
the company originates and closes substantially all new one to four family residential loans as a broker for independent third parties on a servicing released basis 
this generates additional fee income and reduces the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates on the company s future earnings that normally result from holding long term fixed rate loans 
the company has not been an originator or purchaser of option adjustable rate or no documentation portfolio loans and the portfolio does not include any mortgage loans that are considered sub prime 
management expects that in the company s portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans will continue to decrease as most new loan originations will be made as a broker for the third party 
during  consumer loans increased by million  or  to million at december  approximately million  or  of these consumer loans were home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a second lien on residential properties 
these loans typically have a loan to value ratio of or less including any senior liens and are secured by owner occupied residential properties located in the company s normal lending area 
management plans to continue to grow its portfolio of consumer loans in by implementing an incentive plan for its retail branch managers and creating marketing campaigns directed toward growing outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit 
commercial business loans increased by million  or  to million 
management expects similar growth of its commercial business loans in in order to facilitate continued loan growth during  the company plans to open a full service office in rock hill  south carolina during the first quarter of also  the company added one commercial lender and one business banker during the fourth quarter of however  the company s ability to grow the existing loan portfolio is largely dependent on the local economy of the charlotte metropolitan area 
management will also continue to focus on maintaining the current credit quality of the portfolio and will not forsake the credit quality of the loan portfolio for additional growth 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due to an million decrease in investment securities  a million increase in deposits  a million increase in borrowed money  net proceeds of million from the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure  loans and fixed assets  and net income of million in these increases in cash and cash equivalents were partly offset by loan growth of million  a million increase in mortgage backed securities  stock repurchases of million  and the payment of million in cash dividends during management expects that cash and cash equivalents will decrease in as excess liquidity is invested in new loans and higher yielding investment securities 
investment securities decreased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of the sale of million in investment securities and million in normal maturities and calls 
approximately million of the investments sold were long term aaa rated bank qualified municipal securities that were issued by various municipalities that carried an underlying credit rating of less than aa 
these securities were insured as aaa rated obligations by large bond insurance companies that had a higher than expected exposure to sub prime investments  resulting in a potential downgrade from the credit rating agencies from their current aaa rating 
the sale of these municipal securities was effected in order to protect the company from a potential downgrade from the current aaa rating  that could have resulted in a possible other than temporary impairment on these securities 
as of december   the company s municipal bond portfolio totaled million 
management expects that the remaining municipal bond portfolio has sufficient credit support from the underlying municipalities and diversity among the bond insurance companies to adequately mitigate any adverse effects of possible downgrades from the current aaa rating of one or more of the bond insurance companies 
this decrease in investment securities was partly offset by the purchase million in investment securities in mortgage backed securities increased by million  or  from million at the end of  to million at the end of this increase was primarily due to the purchase of million of mortgage backed securities  which was partly offset by the maturity and principal amortization of million of mortgage backed securities and the sale of million of mortgage backed securities during the year 
management expects that in the principal amortization of its mortgage backed securities portfolio will be higher than the principal amortization experienced in as mortgage loan interest rates are expected to decrease in management plans to reinvest the proceeds received from mortgage backed securities into higher yielding commercial and consumer loans as cash flows are generated from these investments through maturities and principal and interest payments 
premises and equipment decreased by  or  to million at december  normal depreciation during amounted to million 
in addition  in the company sold the vacant operations center of the former citizens bank and a right of way parcel of land for approximately  and purchased a parcel of land for future expansion for  plans are underway to open a full service office in york county  south carolina in the first quarter of in a leased facility 
also in  the company will be pursuing additional branch sites in its existing market area as opportunities arise 
total liabilities increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due a million  or  increase in deposits 
total deposits increased from million at december   to million at december  core deposits  which management considers checking accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts  increased by million  or  during management is committed to increasing core deposits and building new and enhancing existing customer relationships through improving technology  expanding its branch network and focused marketing efforts 
in the company developed two new products for both its commercial and retail customers that significantly contributed to the strong growth in core deposit in the first product is our remote deposit capture  which gives our commercial customers the ability to make deposits remotely without physically visiting a branch office 
this allows our commercial sales force the opportunity to solicit business from commercial customers that may not be located near an existing branch office 
the second product includes a new no strings attached high yield checking account product that compares favorably with some of our competitors products that offer a higher interest rate  but includes numerous conditions in order to receive the higher rate 
in addition  we now offer all day banking  which eliminated the pm cutoff for current day processing of deposits 
in we plan to continue to market these and other core products in our local area through normal media outlets and through incentive plans paid to employees for new core customer accounts 
time deposits increased by million  or  to million at december  management is focused on growing its deposit base from within the company s market area 
however  from time to time brokered time deposits may be used as an additional source of liquidity as needed 
as of december   approximately million  or of total deposits  were brokered time deposits 
borrowed money  which includes subordinated debt and retail repurchase agreements  increased by million  or  from million at the end of to million at the end of management will use borrowed money as an additional source of liquidity as needed 
in addition  from time to time  management may use borrowed money to engage in various leverage strategies to increase income as opportunities arise 
total stockholders equity decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share 
these shares were repurchased as a part of stock repurchase plans announced in november  january and january the january repurchase plan provided for the repurchase of  shares  or of the outstanding shares 
all of the shares authorized under this plan were repurchased by january the january repurchase plan provided for the repurchase of  shares  or of the outstanding shares 
all of the shares authorized under this plan were repurchased by november the november repurchase plan provided for the repurchase of  shares  or of the outstanding shares 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares under the plan and had  shares remaining to be repurchased 
management plans to continue to repurchase shares of common stock in the company at prices that are considered to be attractive and in the best interests of both the company and its stockholders 
the decrease in total stockholders equity during was also partly offset by the payment of million in cash dividends  or per share 
these decreases in stockholders equity were partly offset by million in net income earned in and a  decrease in accumulated net unrealized losses on investments available for sale 
results of operations the following discussion relates to operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   as well as the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the net income of the company is heavily dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investment and mortgage backed securities  and interest bearing deposits in other banks  offset by the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the earnings resulted in a return on average equity of in  compared to in  and a return on average assets of in  compared to in net interest income decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely due to a basis point decrease in the net interest margin from for to for the compression of the net interest margin was caused in part by a series of three decreases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board during the second half of that resulted in a basis point decrease in the prime lending rate during the year to at the end of at december   the company had approximately million in loans  or of the company s loan portfolio  repricing each month  the majority of which were tied to the prime lending rate 
while market interest rates were generally higher in than in  this sharp decrease in short term interest rates over a short period of time less than four months at the end of did not provide sufficient time for many of the company s time deposits to reprice at a lower interest rate 
as a result  the yield on assets for did not grow as fast as the increase in the cost of funds  causing the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to decrease from to 
when short term interest rates stabilize  the company s net interest margin should begin to expand as its portfolio of time deposits reprices at lower market rates without any offsetting decreases in the yield on its prime based loan portfolio 
during  the company s ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in this increasing ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities partly offset the negative effect of the decreased net interest margin 
interest income for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was largely due to the fact that average interest earning assets increased by million  or  from million in to million in in addition  while short term interest rates fell during the last four months of  the increases in the prime lending rate during  which were unchanged for the first three quarters of  resulted in a basis point increase in the yield on interest earnings assets to for average outstanding loans increased by million  or  from million to million  while the average yield on loans increased from to from to these changes were primarily the result of organic loan growth during the year  and higher market interest rates during the first three quarters of as a result  interest income on loans increased by million  or  to million in interest earned on interest bearing bank balances decreased by  or  to  in the average balance of interest bearing bank balances decreased by million  or  to million and the average yield on these deposits decreased by basis points to 
interest earned on investment securities increased by million  or  to million in tax equivalent adjustments using a tax rate were made to interest income on investment securities in the amounts of  and  for and  respectively 
this increase in interest income was primarily due to an million  or  increase in the average outstanding balance of investment securities to million in the average tax equivalent yield on investment securities increased by basis points to for due to the increased level of short term interest rates during the first three quarters of and an increased level of higher yielding municipal securities during interest income from mortgage backed securities increased by  or  to million in this increase was largely due to a basis point increase in the average yield from in to in the average balance of mortgage backed securities increased by to million for the increase in the average yield on mortgage backed securities was due in part to slower prepayment levels resulting from higher mortgage interest rates during the year 
management expects the levels of investment and mortgage backed securities will decline during  with the proceeds of any sales  maturities  and normal amortization to be used to fund additional loan originations  stock repurchases  and repayments on maturing borrowed money 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was largely due to average interest bearing liabilities increasing by million  or  from million in to million in in addition  the average cost of funds increased by basis points to in interest expense on deposits increased million  or  to million in this increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in average deposits in and a basis point increase in the cost of deposits to in average deposits increased due to organic growth generated from the company s normal market area 
the cost of funds increased due to the increase in short term rates during which remained in effect for the first three quarters of interest paid on borrowed money increased by  or  to million in average borrowings decreased by million  or  to million for  while the average rate paid on borrowings increased from in to in due to the maturities of lower costing borrowings during the year 
management expects that short term interest rates will continue to decline in  resulting in lower costs of funds for deposits and borrowings 
the company may increase the level of borrowings to provide liquidity for operating purposes  to purchase investment securities  repurchase stock  etc 
if these borrowing levels increase  there will be a corresponding increase in interest expense 
the company provided million and million in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses increased due to strong organic growth in the company s loan portfolio of million  coupled with net charge offs of  during the year 
the level of nonperforming loans decreased by million  to million at december  as a result  the company generated lower late fees generated from delinquent loans and the ratio of nonperforming loans to net loans decreased from at december   to at december  also  real estate owned increased by  to  at december  the company has not been an originator or purchaser of option adjustable rate or no documentation portfolio loans and the company s loan portfolio does not include any mortgage loans that are considered sub prime 
therefore  none of the foreclosures were the result of any sub prime activity by the company 
the properties acquired through foreclosure consist of one to four family residential properties located in the company s normal lending area 
these properties are in various stages of disposition 
nonperforming assets decreased by  to million at december   resulting in decrease in the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets from at december   to at december  refer to allowance for loan losses within item for further discussion 
for the year ended december   noninterest income increased by  or  from million to million 
the company experienced an increase of  from mortgage banking activities 
this was largely due to strong mortgage banking activity during most of mortgage banking activity slowed toward the end of  however  management expects that long term mortgage lending rates will be more attractive in  resulting in steady mortgage lending activity for the company also recognized  in net life insurance proceeds as a result of the untimely death of one of the company s officers after a courageous fight with cancer 
these increases in noninterest income were partly offset by decreases of  in fee income received on deposit accounts   in lower fee income received from lending activities  and  from the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets 
the decrease in fee income on deposit accounts was largely due to the trend of lower fees generated from overdrawn checking accounts 
management believes that this negative trend is industry wide 
however  the negative trend has slowed recently and a continued focus on growing retail and commercial checking accounts should result in a moderate improvement in fee income on deposit accounts in loan fee income decreased primarily as a result of fewer fees generated on commercial real estate and construction loans  as well as lower late fees generated from delinquent loans 
the trend in will largely depend on the company s ability to increase loan activity in a slowing economy 
the decrease in the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets is offset by a corresponding decrease in compensation expense  resulting in no net impact on net income 
net gain on sale of assets increased by  to  in during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a combined net loss of   of real estate acquired through foreclosure at a net loss of   of loans at a net gain of  and  of fixed assets at a net gain  during the year ended december   the company sold  in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a combined net loss of  in addition  during the company sold  in premises and equipment  and  in real estate acquired through foreclosure at a net gain of  noninterest expense increased by  or  from million in to million in this increase was largely due to a  or  increase in compensation expense from million in to million in additional staffing is expected in due to the expected opening of a new full service branch office in the first quarter of occupancy expense increased by  or  to million in the company opened one mortgage loan origination office in leased space during the company plans to open a full service office in rock hill  south carolina in the first quarter of which will be located in a leased building and will replace the existing loan production office in rock hill 
the decrease in the amortization of intangible assets was due to the normal decrease associated with amortizing the core deposit intangible on an accelerated basis 
estimated amortization expense in is expected to be  compared to  in also  in  there were no merger related expenses as compared to  in the expenses incurred in were attributable to the acquisition of trinity bank in october of the company s provision for income taxes was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change was primarily due to a  decrease in pretax income 
the effective tax rate decreased from to due to a larger percentage of income being derived from tax advantaged assets such as municipal securities  us government agency securities  and bank owned life insurance that generate tax exempt income 
management expects to decrease its level of income generated from tax advantaged sources in  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate for comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the earnings resulted in a return on average equity of in  compared to in  and a return on average assets of in  compared to in net interest income increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was largely due to the fact that the company received the benefit of the trinity acquisition for only two months in compared to the full months in this increase was also due in part to a seven basis point increase in the average net interest rate spread from for to for this increase was largely due to a series of basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board during the first half of that resulted in a basis point increase in the prime lending rate during the year to at december  approximately of the company s loan portfolio repriced each month at december   the majority of which was tied to the prime lending rate 
this also contributed to a seven basis point increase in the company s net interest margin from in to in during  the company s ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in this declining ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities  which partly offset the positive effect of the increased net interest rate spread  was due primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million 
interest income for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was largely due to the fact that the company received the benefit of the trinity acquisition for only two months in compared to the full months in partly as a result of the acquisition  average interest earning assets increased by million  or  from million in to million in in addition  due to increases in the prime lending rate during  the yield on interest earnings assets increased by basis points to for average outstanding loans increased by million  or  from million to million  while the average yield on loans increased from to from to these changes were primarily the result of acquiring million in loans in the trinity acquisition in october  organic loan growth of million during the year  and a basis point increase in the prime lending rate during the year 
as a result  interest income on loans increased by million  or  to million in interest earned on interest bearing bank balances increased by  or  to  in the average balance of interest bearing bank balances increased by million  or  to million and the average yield on these deposits increased by basis points to 
interest earned on investment securities  including tax equivalent adjustments of  in and  in  increased by  or  to million in this increase in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average outstanding balance of investment securities to million in the average yield on investment securities increased by basis points to for due to the increased level of short term interest rates during interest income from mortgage backed securities decreased by  or  to million in this decrease was largely due to an million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed securities to million during also  during  the average yield on mortgage backed securities increased from to  due in part to slower prepayment levels resulting from higher mortgage interest rates during the year 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was largely due to the fact that the company received the benefit of the trinity acquisition for only two months in compared to the full months in partly as a result of the acquisition  average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  from million in to million in in addition  the average cost of funds increased by basis points to in interest expense on deposits increased million  or  to million in this increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in average deposits in and a basis point increase in the cost of deposits to in average deposits increased due to million in deposits acquired from trinity in october and million in organic growth 
the cost of funds increased due to the basis point increase in short term rates during interest paid on borrowed money increased by million  or  to million in average borrowings increased by million  or  to million for  while the average rate paid on borrowings increased from in to in due to higher market interest rates in the company provided million and  in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses increased due to strong organic growth in the company s loan portfolio of million  coupled with net charge offs of  during the year 
the level of nonperforming loans increased by  to million at december  as a result  the ratio of nonperforming loans to net loans increased from at december   to at december  also  real estate owned decreased by million to  at december  the properties acquired through foreclosure consist of one one to four family residential property and one residential lot 
these properties are in various stages of disposition 
as a result  the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased from at december   to at december  for the year ended december   noninterest income increased by million  or  from million to million 
the company experienced increases of  in fee income on deposit accounts   from mortgage banking and lending activities   in dividends on fhlb stock   from the cash value of bank owned life insurance   increase in the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets  and  in other noninterest income 
these increases in noninterest income were largely due to the fact that the company received the benefit of the trinity acquisition for only two months in compared to the full months in the increase in mortgage banking and loan fee income was also due to an increased amount of fee income from commercial loans coupled with strong mortgage banking activity during fee income on deposit accounts was higher largely due to the increased number of accounts which resulted in an increase in fees generated from overdrawn checking accounts 
management believes that a continued focus on growing retail and commercial checking accounts will result in a moderate improvement in fee income on deposit accounts in the increase on dividends on fhlb stock is directly related to the rate paid by the fhlb and the number of outstanding shares based on outstanding advances 
the increase in the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets is offset by a corresponding decrease in compensation expense  resulting in no net impact on net income

during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a net gain of  most of these sales were from securities acquired from trinity 
these proceeds were primarily used to repurchase additional investments that were more reflective of the company s investment philosophy of investing in shorter term investment securities and mortgage backed securities that provide a stable level of cash flow to fund future loan growth 
the company also recognized a  net gain on sale of both  of other real estate owned and  of premises and equipment 
noninterest expense increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase was largely due to the acquisition of trinity  which added approximately employees and three additional full service offices  and the opening of a new full service office in belmont  north carolina 
as a result  compensation expense increased by million  or  from million in to million in the company integrated the back office functions of trinity during the first quarter of  which resulted in a decrease of eight employees

these increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of trinity bank 
these increases in noninterest expenses were partly offset by a  decrease in merger related expenses 
the company experienced merger and conversion expenses in in the amount of  compared to  in in addition  data processing expense decreased by  or  due to the consolidation during the first quarter of of the two data processing systems resulting from the merger 
the company s provision for income taxes was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change was primarily due to a million increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate increased from to due to a smaller percentage of income being derived from tax advantaged assets such as municipal securities  us government agency securities  and bank owned life insurance that generate tax exempt income 
net interest income the net income of the company is heavily dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income also depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended december   and for the years indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  is expressed both in dollars and rates

in the past  we concentrated our lending activities on conventional first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties 
however  since converting to a stock company in  the company has focused more of its lending activities on construction loans  nonresidential real estate loans  commercial business loans and consumer loans 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  either as primary or secondary collateral  located in our primary market area 
the company has a diversified loan portfolio with no material concentrations to any one borrower or industry 
our lending activities are subject to the written  non discriminatory  underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by management and approved by our board of directors 
loan originations come from a number of sources including real estate agents  home builders  walk in customers  referrals and existing customers 
loan officers also call on local businesses soliciting commercial products 
we advertise our loan products in various print media including local newspapers as well as the company s website 
in our marketing  we emphasize our community ties  personalized customer service  and an efficient underwriting and approval process 
all real estate collateral is appraised or evaluated in accordance with regulatory requirements 
on new loan originations  we require hazard  title and  to the extent applicable  flood insurance on all security property

in addition  the board of directors has delegated incremental loan approval limits to certain lending officers which allow them to approve a new loan to an existing customer in an amount equal to  or less than  their incremental loan limit that would otherwise require approval by the board of directors or the additional approval of another lending officer 
any loan approved by a lending officer using their incremental loan limit must be ratified by the board of directors or approved by another lending officer  as applicable  after the loan has been made

the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates 
nonperforming assets and delinquencies 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  we attempt to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower and collecting the payment 
computer generated late notices are mailed days after a payment is due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency continues  additional contact is made either through a notice or other means and we will attempt to work out a payment schedule and actively encourage delinquent residential mortgage borrowers to seek home ownership counseling 
while we generally prefer to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  we will institute foreclosure or other proceedings  as necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status generally if  in the opinion of management  principal or interest payments are not likely in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement  such as when principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest accrued but not collected at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against income in the current period 
loans may be reinstated to accrual status when payments are under days past due or  in the opinion of management  collection of the remaining past due balances can be reasonably expected 
our board of directors is informed monthly of the total amount of loans which are more than days delinquent 
loans that are more than days delinquent or in foreclosure are reviewed by the board on an individual basis each month

real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate acquired in settlement of loans until sold 
generally  foreclosed assets are held for sale and such assets are carried at the lower of cost or market value minus estimated cost to sell the property 
after the date of acquisition  all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed and costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property are capitalized up to the extent of their net realizable value 
at december   we had  in real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this balance is comprised of single family residences located in the bank s normal lending area 
these properties are in various stages of disposition 
restructured loans 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as troubled debt restructurings 
in general  the modification or restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring if we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrowers that we would not otherwise consider 
debt restructurings or loan modifications for a borrower do not necessarily always constitute troubled debt restructurings  however  and troubled debt restructurings do not necessarily result in nonaccrual loans 
we had one restructured loan as of december   totaling million 
asset classification 
the ots has adopted various regulations regarding problem assets of financial institutions 
the regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  ots examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  we establish specific allowances for loan losses for the full amount of the portion of the asset classified as loss 
all or a portion of general loan loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful can be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital  while specific valuation allowances for loan losses generally do not qualify as regulatory capital 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention 
as of december   we had million of assets classified as substandard and no assets classified as either doubtful or loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention as of december   was million 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  management determined that impaired loans were not material as of december  as of december   we had million in assets classified substandard and no assets classified as either doubtful or loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention as of december   was million 
pursuant to sfas no 
 management determined that impaired loans were not material as of december  allowance for loan losses management has established a systematic methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and considers all loans in the portfolio 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired under sfas the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectibility 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million 
management believes that this amount meets the requirement for losses on loans that management considers to be impaired  for known losses  and for risks inherent in the remaining loan portfolios 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic evaluation by various regulatory authorities and may be subject to adjustment upon their examination

at december   citizens south bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements 
under prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s capital well capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  adequately capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  significantly undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  and critically undercapitalized less than tangible capital

funding for future growth is dependent upon the earnings of the company and its subsidiaries 
at december   the company had a capital to assets ratio of 
as such  the company fully expects to be able to meet future capital needs caused by growth and expansion as well as regulatory requirements 
the company plans to continue to repurchase its shares of common stock in the open market from time to time as market conditions warrant

liquidity the objectives of the company s liquidity management policy include providing adequate funds to meet the cash needs of both borrowers and depositors  to provide for the on going operations of the company  and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the company s ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  increases in local deposits  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
if the company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  it may rely upon external sources of funds such in brokered deposits and borrowings  including federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
the company has approximately million in additional advances available from its line of credit from the fhlb 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and we are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets principally securities that are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the us government provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
the company may also solicit brokered deposits for providing funds for asset growth 
in the normal course of business  various commitments are outstanding that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit and undisbursed advances on customer lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
the funding of these commitments and previously approved undisbursed lines of credit could effect the company s liquidity position 
at december   the company had loan commitments of million  million in undisbursed construction loan proceeds  and unused lines of credit of million 
the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund loan commitments and lines of credit as they arise 
the company does not have any special purpose entities or other similar forms of off balance sheet financing 
under existing contractual obligations  the company will be required to make payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about payments due under such contractual obligations at december  the company expects that a portion of the deposits will not be renewed upon maturity 
if there is a higher than normal level of time deposits that are not renewed at maturity  then the company may experience a decrease in liquidity 
this may result in the company offering higher than market interest rates to maintain deposits  which would increase interest expense 
transaction deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities have been classified as having payments due in one year or less 
contractual maturities payments due by period at december  one year one to over three over five or less three years to five years years total dollars in thousands borrowed funds deposits lease obligations total management of market risks market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest risks 
the risk of loss can be reflected in diminished market values and or reduced net interest income in future periods 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  as the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the structure of the company s loan and deposit portfolios is such that significant declines in interest rates could adversely impact net interest income 
the company does not maintain a trading account  nor is it subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for monitoring and managing exposure to interest rate risk  as discussed below in interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity the company s alco monitors the company s level of interest rate sensitivity and ensures that the level of sensitivity of the company s net portfolio value is maintained within limits established by the board of directors 
through such management  the alco seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
during the past year  the alco utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of short term commercial business loans and nonresidential mortgage loans  emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate home equity lines of credit  emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  originating all new fixed rate mortgage loans as a broker for a third party  and focusing on growing the company s core deposit portfolio 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of the bank s cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the bank s net portfolio value or npv and the net interest income nii of the bank would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
these computations estimate the effect on a bank s npv and nii from instantaneous and permanent one hundred to three hundred basis point increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the following table presents the bank s projected change in npv and nii at december   as calculated by an independent third party  based upon information provided by the bank 
the bank s level of sensitivity  given a hypothetical  immediate  and sustained change in interest rates from basis points to basis points  is within the range of acceptable sensitivity established by the board of directors and is detailed on the following table 
interest rate sensitivity hypothetical  immediate  estimated theoretical estimated theoretical and sustained net interest income net portfolio value changes in interest rates amount change amount change dollars in thousands basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise no change basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services
