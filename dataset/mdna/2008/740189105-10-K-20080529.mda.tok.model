item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data business overview we completed another successful year in fiscal  attaining record levels of sales  operating income  net income from continuing operations  and earnings per share 
these results were principally driven by continuing strong conditions in our core aerospace and power generation markets  effective volume leverage  and disciplined cost reduction and operational improvements across all of our segments 
also  during the year  we successfully acquired mcwilliams and caledonian  two strategically important acquisitions within the forged products segment 
in april  we completed the acquisition of mcwilliams  a leading manufacturer of titanium  nickel and steel forgings  primarily for commercial and military aerospace applications 
mcwilliams has established long term relationships with manufacturers of smaller aircraft engines  thereby extending the customer reach of our forging operations 
mcwilliams operates both hammer and screw presses for open and closed die forging 
in july  we completed the acquisition of caledonian  the market leader in providing nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine igt markets 
revert includes metal chips  casting gates  bar ends  forging flash  and other byproducts from casting  forging  and fastener manufacturing processes that can be re melted and reused 
the acquisition of caledonian provides us with the infrastructure and capabilities needed to create a closed loop system for the retention and reuse of internally generated revert 
in addition  caledonian provides access to new sources of material outside the company and helps determine optimal utilization of revert streams throughout our melting operations worldwide 
during the third quarter of fiscal  greenville metals  a metal processing operation  became part of the forged products segment to take advantage of synergies with caledonian 
greenville metals was formerly a business in the investment cast products segment 
also  during the year  we continued to increase manufacturing capacity to support growth in our core markets with completion or initiation of various large scale capital expenditure projects  primarily within the forged products segment 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately percent higher than fiscal spending levels  with the most significant capacity expansion projects planned within the investment cast products segment to support record demand for igt products 
looking ahead  we will continue to capitalize on our strong foundation across all markets 
we are well positioned on existing as well as new and expanding aerospace platforms  driven by continuing increases in oem aircraft build rates  high aircraft utilization rates  and an expanding aerospace customer base 
we also expect to benefit from solid growth in demand for igt components and extruded pipe products serving the power generation market  as well as further market penetration in our non aerospace nickel alloys serving the oil and gas  chemical processing and pollution control industries

these businesses were reclassified from the former industrial products segment now the fastener products segment to discontinued operations 
both transactions were completed during the third quarter of fiscal restructuring  asset impairment and other non recurring charges we regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions  taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve 
the following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal and fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the investment cast products segment recorded restructuring charges of million  primarily for shut down costs associated with an underutilized machining operation located in the united kingdom 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  which included million primarily for the write down of a building and equipment to fair value related to consolidation of a machining operation in the investment cast products segment  and million for severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to downsizing a tooling operation in ireland 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
outlook looking forward to fiscal  we are well positioned for continued success and profitable growth 
we see a continuation of growing demand from all our major markets  and our manufacturing operations are prepared to take advantage of volume leverage and opportunities for cost reduction 
we have ramped up capital spending in the last two years to increase production capacity  and we expect additional capital spending in fiscal to further increase capacity to meet growing demand in our core markets 
we will be fully prepared to meet the increased demand from our aerospace customers as new production programs such as the airbus a  boeing  f fighter  and kc x tanker come on line 
on the igt front  major turbine programs currently in production and new platforms in development are providing significant growth opportunities across an expanded customer base 
extruded pipe has a growing backlog extending more than months  and our non aerospace nickel alloy operations are steadily opening up new market opportunities 
in concert with this top line growth  we have a full pipeline of projects designed to streamline our manufacturing plants and to reduce costs quarter after quarter 
we expect fiscal sales to grow organically by approximately to percent  driven by strong conditions in our core markets and our increased manufacturing capacity 
we believe changes in metal prices will continue to impact sales growth during fiscal  as we have already begun to see raw material costs  primarily nickel  decline in the last two quarters 
in addition  continued growth in intercompany sales  particularly within our forged products segment  will have an impact on reported sales as capacity is utilized for internal demands and these sales are eliminated in consolidation 
internal supply allows us to manage our overall value stream more cost effectively from raw material to forged component 
operating income is expected to benefit from the sales volume increases and continued operational improvements  and operating margin as a percent of sales is also expected to show modest improvement over fiscal levels principally due to leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating performance across all segments 
as in prior years  we will remain active on the acquisition front  continually assessing the strategic fit and value of businesses that have potential for success within our existing framework 
at the same time  we will continually assess the suitability and management of our existing businesses in order to maintain our strong financial position and competitive profile

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a percent increase from fiscal sales of  million 
the increase in sales primarily resulted from higher sales from the aerospace fastener operations  of which approximately million represented incremental sales from a full year of cherry aerospace  acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales from the engineered fastener and industrial products operations decreased percent year over year  principally due to weaker demand from the automotive industry 
operating income for the fasteners segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business  as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes 
sales and operating income within the fastener products segment are expected to grow during fiscal as a result of increased sales volume to the aerospace market resulting from strong aerospace demand  continued market share gains  and qualification of existing capacity from automotive to aerospace production  partially offset by soft conditions in the north american automotive market 
operating income as a percent of sales is also expected to improve due to continuing cost take outs and leverage from higher sales 
fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million and operating income of million  or percent of sales 
fiscal sales increased percent from the prior year s sales of  million  and operating income increased by percent over the prior year s operating income of million  or percent of sales 
the increase in sales was due to the addition of sales from cherry aerospace acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a full year of sales from shur lok acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the favorable impact of strong aerospace sales  partially offset by weaker demand from the automotive industry 
the improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and higher margin aerospace business  as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes 
interest and taxes net interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the lower net interest expense was due to reduced debt levels  lower borrowing rates  and higher interest income compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  compared with percent in fiscal the slight increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from audit settlements in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the loss of the extraterritorial income exclusion benefit in  which is partially offset by a larger us manufacturing deduction in liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at march  represented a million increase from the  million balance at april  this increase was driven by the addition of mcwilliams and caledonian assets totaling million  and by increased inventories and receivables to support continuing revenue growth in the base businesses

this positive net cash flow consisted primarily of million from operating activities adjusted for voluntary pension contributions  million from various asset dispositions and business divestitures  and million from the issuance of common stock and related tax benefit  partially offset by capital expenditures of million and dividend payments of million 
capital spending of million in fiscal principally provided for equipment maintenance and upgrades  capacity expansion  cost reduction and safety projects 
the capital spending plan for fiscal  which is anticipated to be approximately to percent higher than capital spending in fiscal  provides for additional capacity expansion  cost reduction  and equipment maintenance and upgrades throughout the company

critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations 
such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows  expected market growth rate  our estimates of sales volumes  sales prices and related costs  and discount rate applied 
management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated  however  changes to management s assumptions used during the impairment testing could affect the consolidated financial statements 
environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but any amounts  and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued  are not reasonably estimable at this time 
total environmental reserves accrued at march  and april  were million and million  respectively 
generally  the increase in environmental reserves over the prior year reflects existing liabilities associated with our acquisitions  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and is not the result of newly discovered environmental liabilities 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarified the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations covered 
table of contents by this interpretation include those for which an entity has a large obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in accordance with sfas no 
and fin  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
currently  we have identified a known asset retirement obligation associated with environmental contamination at one of our manufacturing facilities 
however  we have not recognized a liability under fin for this retirement obligation because the fair value of remediation at this site cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time 
the settlement date is unknown because remediation of this site is not required until production ceases  and we have no current or future plans to cease production 
this asset retirement obligation  when estimable  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or business 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
beginning in fiscal  we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
as a result  we report a liability resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense
