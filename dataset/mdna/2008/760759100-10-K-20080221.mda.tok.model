item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form k 
overview of our business we are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states 
we provide solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states 
we also own or operate transfer stations  solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations 
our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal  recycling  compost  mulch and soil operations 
the following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended december   and in millions years ended december  collection residential commercial industrial other total collection transfer and disposal less intercompany transfer and disposal  net other revenue our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal  labor  self insurance  fuel and equipment maintenance costs 
it also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities 
we seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal 
during the three months ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 
our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance  and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards 
table of contents of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs  available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates  changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted

table of contents our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments 
from to  revenue increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy 
compared to revenue in our eastern region increased during compared to due to price increases in all lines of business and an increase in the price of commodities 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the industrial collection line of business primarily due to less temporary work  and lower landfill volumes 
these lower volumes resulted from less favorable weather conditions and a general slowdown in residential construction during operating margins in the eastern region decreased from to primarily because of a million charge to operating expenses and a million charge to selling  general and administrative expenses associated with environmental conditions at our countywide recycling and disposal facility in east sparta  ohio 
excluding these expenses  operating margins increased from in to in  primarily due to higher revenue  lower disposal costs  and lower truck and equipment maintenance costs 
revenue in our central region increased during compared to due to price increases in all lines of business and an increase in the price of commodities 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial collection  industrial collection and landfill lines of business 
lower volumes in the collection lines of business are primarily due to less favorable weather conditions during and a general slowdown in economic conditions 
lower landfill volumes are primarily due to our decision to limit our acceptance of certain waste streams 
operating margins in our central region increased due to higher revenue  lower disposal costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas this increase in operating margins was partially offset by increases in risk insurance and landfill operating costs 
in our southern region  price increases in all lines of business  increases in the price of commodities  and increases in commercial collection  residential collection and landfill volumes resulted in an increase in revenue during compared to this increase in revenue was partially offset by lower industrial collection volumes 
these lower volumes are primarily due to a general slowdown in residential construction in  and hurricane related work that was performed during operating margins in our southern region increased primarily due to higher revenue  lower disposal costs due to drier weather  lower truck and equipment maintenance costs  and lower labor costs 
our southwestern region benefited from price increases in all lines of business and volume increases in the commercial collection  industrial collection and landfill lines of business 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in residential collection volumes 
this decrease in residential collection volumes is primarily due to the city of houston assuming responsibility for collecting municipal solid waste 
the increase in operating margins in our southwestern region is primarily due to higher revenue and lower selling  general and administrative costs 
this increase in operating margins was partially offset by higher disposal and truck maintenance costs 
in our western region  price increases in all lines of business  volume increases in the residential collection line of business and an increase in commodity prices resulted in an increase in revenue during compared to this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from a general slowdown in residential construction in operating margins in our western region decreased because of an million increase in landfill operating costs and a million increase in sfas amortization expense associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county  california 
excluding these expenses  operating margins increased from in to in  primarily due to higher revenue and an increase in the price of commodities 

table of contents the decrease in operating costs for corporate entities from to is due to a million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during as a result of refining our estimate of our allowance based on our historical collection experience  which was partially offset by increases in operating costs associated with the expansion of our business 
compared to revenue in our eastern region increased during compared to due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and due to increased volumes in our industrial collection and landfill businesses 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume in our commercial and residential collection businesses and by the sale of our operations in western new york during the three months ended march  operating margins decreased from to due to higher landfill operating and fuel costs partially offset by higher revenue 
in our central region  revenue increased during compared to due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and volume growth in our landfill line of business arising from favorable economic conditions 
operating margins decreased primarily due to increased third party hauling costs associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of toronto to one of our landfills in michigan 
this increase in costs was partially offset by adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas our operations in the southern region experienced the greatest margin improvement of all of our segments because of price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business 
operating margins increased because of an increase in revenue arising from favorable economic conditions  partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas operating margins also improved during because of higher costs incurred during the fourth quarter of related to hurricane clean up 
in our southwestern region  revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business  partially offset by the sale of our remediation and heavy construction services business during the fourth quarter of the increase in operating margins from to is attributable to an increase in revenue arising from improving economic conditions  partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas in our western region  revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business 
operating margins decreased from to because of higher fuel  labor and insurance costs  partially offset by an increase in revenue during and adjustments for landfill amortization expense associated with sfas the increase in operating costs for corporate entities from to is due to the expansion of our business  incremental costs associated with our adoption of sfas r  additional costs associated with our k plan resulting from an increase in the employer s matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation 
financial objectives in february  we publicly announced our objectives for the year 
these objectives included the following generating free cash flow a non gaap measure in excess of of net income  or approximately million

growing revenue from core operations by approximately to  with approximately to attributable to price increases and attributable to volume growth 
in july  we updated our core revenue growth guidance to approximately  with approximately attributable to price growth excluding commodities  while volume was expected to decline approximately 
purchasing approximately million of property and equipment  net of sales of property and equipment 
in july  we reduced this to million 
business performance during  we met or exceeded our financial objectives

during  we generated diluted earnings per share of 
excluding pre tax charges of million million  or per diluted share  net of tax related to our countywide and contra costa county facilities and a pre tax gain of million million  or per diluted share  net of tax related to the sale of our compost  mulch and soil business in texas  our diluted earnings per share would have been 
our internal growth from core operations for  excluding commodities  divestitures  taxes and non core operations  was  with from price increases offset by a decline in volume 
during  our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of the broad based price increases we secured offset various escalating capital and operating costs  including fuel costs 
during  we experienced lower industrial collection and landfill volumes primarily resulting from the slowdown in residential construction 
excluding the million of charges we recorded during related to our countywide and contra costa county facilities  our operating margins increased by from in to in during  improved pricing and continued focus on productivity improvements offset higher fuel and insurance costs 
financial objectives our financial objectives for assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of specific guidance is as follows we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income  or approximately to million 
we anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our existing million share repurchase program and a new million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january we also anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends 
we anticipate diluted earnings of to per share 
we anticipate operating margins of approximately 

table of contents we are targeting internal growth from core operations to be approximately to  with approximately to attributable to core price increases  while the change in volume is expected to be down

we anticipate purchasing approximately million of property and equipment  net of sales of property and equipment 
business initiatives our business initiatives for are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems 
ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives 
our business initiatives for are as follows pricing initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business 
the purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs and improve operating margins 
we realized the benefit of this initiative during the past several years and expect a continuing benefit during improve business integration 
during  we took a number of steps to further strengthen our business platform and improve our business integration 
in response to limited vertical integration opportunities  we divested of our operations in western new york 
we acquired a landfill in the dallas fort worth area which better integrated that marketplace 
in addition  we divested of our remediation and heavy construction services business 
during  we divested of our texas based compost  mulch and soil business 
we plan to continue to develop and implement strategies that improve the performance of locations and lines of business that are performing below the company s average 
to achieve this objective  we may purchase operations from  sell operations to or exchange operations with other companies in the future 
improve the quality of our revenue 
during  we completed the development of the next generation of our billing and operating system 
this system standardizes our billing and operating processes 
it also provides a variety of functionalities including customer service  dispatch  billing  sales analysis  account retention and route productivity analysis 
during  we will continue to ensure that our operating personnel are utilizing the system to its full potential 
we currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and use a return on investment pricing model 
this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 
we use a customer relationship management system 
this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
during  we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended 
improve the productivity of our operations 
we use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers 
in addition  in our larger markets  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density 
during  we will continue to update our disposal optimization metrics 
these metrics identify which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow 
improve fleet management and procurement 
we use dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations 
among other features  this system tracks parts inventories  generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work 
it allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations 
in addition  the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory 
during  we intend to further utilize this purchase order module to take advantage of volume discounts 
enhance operational and financial reporting systems 
we have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems 
the overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed 
table of contents information  prepared in a consistent manner  that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business 
one of our most significant systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package  which includes lawson general ledger software and lawson fixed asset software 
during december  we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson enterprise wide human resources software 
this software provides a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software 
it also provides a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employee related initiatives such as training 
all of the system initiatives mentioned above provide us with more consistent and detailed information  thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions 
in addition  all of our significant software applications are standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale  florida 
this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines 
it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan 
expand our safety training programs 
in light of increasing insurance costs and as part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices  we continue to expand our safety training programs 
safety will continue to be a key area of focus during customer first program 
in order to secure our position as a leading provider of world class customer service  we have initiated a customer first program 
several of our divisions were selected to implement this program during this program entails establishing sustainable and competitive service standards in each applicable marketplace 
systems to measure our success in meeting our service level standards will also be developed 
best practices derived from the program will be implemented throughout our company 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and disclosures our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using us generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows  and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference landfill accounting life cycle accounting we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization  depletion and accretion expense 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations landfill and environmental matters 
note  landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 
probable expansion airspace we include expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted in our calculation of total available airspace 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion and accretion expense could change significantly

note  landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference final capping  closure and post closure we account for our final capping  closure and post closure activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas  obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill  depending on the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the company s credit adjusted  risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred 
future costs for final capping  closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers  and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 
changes in any of these estimates could affect our amortization of final capping  closure and post closure costs and our accretion expense

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference self insurance our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially 
if actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates  our self insurance expense would change

property and equipment expenditures for improvements  repairs and maintenance expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized 
all expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment

we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december   and the aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  during  we entered into a million capital lease related to a landfill 
in november  we divested of our texas based compost  mulch and soil business and received proceeds of million

goodwill for acquisitions totaled million 
as of december   we had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of  million 
million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions including the landfill capital lease and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace during when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets  purchase price is allocated to airspace based on the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired which are primarily for final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace  which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 
consolidated results of operations years ended december   and our net income was million for the year ended december   or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in during the year ended december   we recorded pre tax charges of million million  or 
per diluted share  net of tax related to estimated costs that we believe are required to comply with final findings and orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency in response to environmental conditions at our countywide recycling and disposal facility in east sparta  ohio and to undertake certain other remedial actions we have agreed with the oepa to perform  including  without limitation  installing a fire break and removing liquids from gas extraction wells 
while we intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the f os and the additional remedial actions  we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries 
during the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax charge of million million  or 
per diluted share  net of tax associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county  california 
these additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the california department of toxic substance control 
the charges for our countywide and contra costa county facilities affected our consolidated statements of income as follows year ended december  expenses cost of operations depreciation  amortization and depletion selling  general and administrative operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes 
table of contents during the year ended december   we recorded a net tax benefit of million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various tax matters  including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years through income tax expense for the year ended december  includes a million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters  including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits for the years through we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

table of contents a core volume growth for the year ended december  includes 
associated with hauling waste from the city of toronto to one of our landfills in michigan 
this hauling service is provided to the city at a rate that approximates our cost 
b represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers 
during the year ended december   our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of our revenue growth also benefited from higher prices for commodities 
however  we experienced a decrease in core volume growth primarily due to lower industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from the slowdown in residential construction 
during the year ended december   our revenue growth continued to benefit from our broad based pricing initiative 
we experienced core volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business 
this core volume growth was partially offset by hurricane clean up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from our broad based pricing initiative 
during the year ended december   we experienced core volume growth in our residential collection  industrial collection and landfill businesses 
our core volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts 
in june  we began assessing environmental fees on the non franchise portion of our customer base 
outlook we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be approximately to during  with approximately to attributable to core price increases  while the change in volume is expected to be down 
to 
our projections assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of however  our internal growth may remain flat or may decline in depending on economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives 
cost of operations 
cost of operations was  million   million and  million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily a result of the million of charges we have recorded in cost of operations related to estimated costs to comply with final findings and orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency and to undertake certain other remedial actions in response to environmental conditions at our countywide facility and the million charge we recorded related to an increase in leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county  california 
the increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth 
the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december   and in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue years ended december  subcontractor  disposal and third party fees labor and benefits maintenance and operating insurance and other total 
table of contents a description of our cost categories is as follows subcontractor  disposal and third party fees include costs such as third party disposal  transportation of waste  host fees and cost of goods sold 
the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for all periods presented is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing 
during  drier weather  particularly in our southern region  resulted in lower disposal costs 
in addition  the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue from to is due to costs incurred during the fourth quarter of related to hurricane clean up 
these reductions in costs were partially offset by additional third party hauling costs incurred during associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of toronto to one of our landfills in michigan 
labor and benefits include costs such as wages  salaries  payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service employees and their supervisors 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is due to increases in benefits including health insurance 
in addition  during december  we assumed responsibility for hauling a portion of our transfer station volumes to one of our landfills 
this hauling service reduced our third party fees and increased various other cost categories  the most significant of which is labor 
the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing and productivity improvements in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business 
maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel  parts  shop labor and benefits  third party repairs  and landfill monitoring and operating 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to an increase in landfill operating costs resulting from million of charges recorded during the year ended december  for our countywide facility 
these charges related to increases in estimated costs to comply with final findings and orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency and to undertake certain other remedial actions in response to environmental conditions 
in addition  landfill operating costs increased due to an million charge associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county  california 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to increases in fuel and landfill operating costs 
the cost of fuel as a percentage of revenue increased by 
from to and by 
from to insurance and other includes costs such as workers compensation  auto and general liability insurance  property taxes  property maintenance and utilities 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims 
the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies 
as such  care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 
depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment 
depreciation  amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is partially due to million of adjustments to landfill amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under sfas in addition  during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of additional depletion and amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 
depreciation expense during was also slightly higher due to our ongoing truck and equipment replacement program 
the slight decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december  versus the comparable period is due to lower landfill amortization and depletion expense during 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill  but also includes values assigned to long term contracts  covenants not to compete and customer relationships 
expenses for amortization of intangible assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue

changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at twelve of our landfills 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at eleven of our landfills 
between 
table of contents december  and december   we received permits for five of our probable expansions  which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 
during  total available airspace increased by a net million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken  changes in engineering estimates and permits granted  partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design 
in addition  during the year ended december   total available airspace was increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in texas  which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in texas 
changes in design in are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 
during  total available airspace decreased by million cubic yards due to airspace consumption  partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken  the acquisition of a landfill  permits granted and changes in engineering estimates  partially offset by airspace consumed 
as of december   we owned or operated solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 
billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet all of our expansion criteria 
see note  landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   eleven of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these eleven landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
probable expansion airspace represents of our total available airspace 
we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace

while we intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the f os and the additional remedial actions  we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries 
also during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county  california 
these additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the california department of toxic substance control 
we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace  as appropriate

this increase is also partially due to million of additional depletion and amortization expense we have recorded during the year ended december  associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 
during the years ended december   and  our weighted average compaction rate was approximately  pounds per cubic yard based on our three year historical moving average 
our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 
as of december   we expect to spend an estimated additional billion on existing landfills  primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures  over their expected remaining lives 
our total expected investment  excluding non depletable land  estimated to be billion  or per cubic yard  is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method

the notes were offered at a discount of million 
in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions 
our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of million and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 
our swap agreements mature in august at december   we had million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which million were obtained during fiscal borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from to at december  and have maturities ranging from to as of december   we had million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings

expected maturity date fair value asset liability as of december  thereafter total fixed rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates variable rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates interest rate swaps fixed to variable notional amount in millions average pay rate average receive rate the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value  since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions years ended december  cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow free cash flow for the year ended december  was higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of property and equipment  higher deferred income taxes and lower payments for asset retirement obligations 
free cash flow for the year ended december  was negatively affected by an million federal tax payment that had been deferred until february as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 
free cash flow for the year ended december  was higher than the other years presented primarily because of a million federal tax payment that was deferred 
during february  we paid million of these deferred payments 
purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures 
a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property 
table of contents and equipment received during the period for the years ended december   and is as follows in millions years ended december  purchases of property and equipment presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows adjustment for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period  net property and equipment received during the current period the adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows or our free cash flow 
we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment  net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform  repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our stockholders  paying cash dividends  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
seasonality and severe weather our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites  or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective beginning january  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas will be effective for our company beginning january  at the effective date  a company may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date 
the company would report the initial effect of any remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied 
upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected would be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings 
we do not believe that sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
there are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to us
