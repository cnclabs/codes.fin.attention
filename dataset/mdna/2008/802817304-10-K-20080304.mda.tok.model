item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing proprietary products that address the needs of patients treated by gastroenterologists or primary care physicians 
the primary focus of our current efforts is the commercialization of our proprietary  immediate release proton pump inhibitor  or ppi  technology for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal  or gi  diseases and disorders  including gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd 
in the us prescription market  our commercial organization promotes our zegerid omeprazole sodium bicarbonate products to targeted gastroenterologists and primary care physicians in the primary detail position  with additional promotional support provided under our contract sales organization and co promotion arrangements 
to further leverage our proprietary ppi technology and diversify our sources of revenue  we have entered into strategic alliances with schering plough consumer healthcare products  inc  or schering plough  for the us and canadian over the counter  or otc  markets  and with glaxo group limited  an affiliate of glaxosmithkline  plc  or gsk  for prescription and otc markets in up to countries in africa  asia  the middle east  and central and south america  as well as prescription markets in puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
in addition to our efforts related to our ppi technology  our commercial organization co promotes additional primary care and gastroenterology products in the us our goal is to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company  and we plan to continue to seek to maximize the value of our ppi technology  as well as expand our product portfolio through co promotion  licensing or acquisition of marketed or late stage proprietary products 
our zegerid products are proprietary immediate release formulations that combine omeprazole  a ppi  and one or more antacids and are currently marketed in capsule and powder for oral suspension dosage forms 
these products were developed by us as the first immediate release oral ppis for the us prescription market  and they have been approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to treat or reduce the risk of a variety of upper gi diseases and disorders 
according to ims health  an independent market research firm  the us market for prescription ppi products had total sales of more than billion during we believe our zegerid products offer a differentiated treatment option for physicians and their patients and represent an attractive market opportunity 
our zegerid products are based on patented technology and utilize antacids  which raise the gastric ph and thus protect the ppi  omeprazole  from acid degradation in the stomach  allowing the omeprazole to be quickly absorbed into the bloodstream 
although other marketed oral ppis enjoy widespread use due to their potent acid suppression  favorable safety profiles and once a day dosing  they are available only in delayed release  enteric coated formulations 
while the enteric coatings protect delayed release ppis from acid degradation in the stomach  they also delay absorption until the delayed release ppis reach the alkaline environment of the small intestine  where the enteric coatings dissolve 
our immediate release zegerid products are not enterically coated and are designed to provide both rapid and continued nighttime and daytime acid control 
we received approval from the fda to market zegerid omeprazole sodium bicarbonate capsules in february for the treatment of heartburn and other symptoms associated with gerd  treatment and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers 
we received approval from the fda to market zegerid omeprazole sodium bicarbonate powder for oral suspension for these same indications in in addition  zegerid powder for oral suspension mg is approved for the reduction of risk of upper gi bleeding in critically ill patients  and is currently the only ppi product approved for this indication 
we received fda approval of each of our new drug applications  or ndas  for our zegerid products within the initial month period for fda review under the policies of the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa 
we commercially launched zegerid capsules mg and mg in late march  and launched zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in october and mg in february 
table of contents we have established a commercial organization that is targeting the highest ppi prescribing physicians in the us  with a focus on approximately  office based gastroenterologists and primary care physicians 
we estimate that this group of physicians collectively wrote approximately one third of the value of ppi prescriptions written in we believe our concentration on high volume ppi prescribers enables us to effectively promote our products with a relatively focused sales and marketing organization 
our field sales organization includes our own sales representatives  fully dedicated contract sales representatives under our contract sales organization agreement with inventiv commercial services  llc  or inventiv  as well as additional representatives under our co promotion agreement with otsuka america pharmaceutical inc  or otsuka america 
in january  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with the university of missouri  under which we licensed rights to its patents and patent applications relating to specific formulations of immediate release ppis with antacids for treating upper gi diseases and disorders 
this licensed technology forms the basis of our zegerid family of products 
we paid the university of missouri an upfront licensing fee of million in and a one time million milestone fee upon the filing of our first nda in in july  we paid a one time million milestone fee based upon the fda s approval of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  and we are required to make additional milestone payments to the university of missouri upon initial commercial sale in specified territories outside the us  which may total up to million in the aggregate 
we are also required to make milestone payments based on first time achievement of significant sales thresholds  up to a maximum of million  the first of which is a million milestone payment upon initial achievement of million in annual calendar year sales  which includes sales by us  gsk and schering plough

in august  we received a million milestone payment relating to progress on clinical product development strategy 
we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones and up to an additional million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified sales milestones 
we expect that schering plough will submit an nda for its first licensed otc product in march or april of we will also receive low double digit royalties  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  on net sales of any otc products sold by schering plough under the license agreement 
in turn  we will be obligated to pay royalties to the university of missouri based on net sales of any otc products sold by schering plough 
the license agreement will remain in effect as long as schering plough is marketing products under the license agreement in the us or canada 
schering plough may terminate the agreement on days prior written notice anytime after submitting its first nda for a licensed product or if schering plough does not meet a specified deadline for receiving marketing approval in the us for a licensed product 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement in the event of uncured material breach of a material obligation  subject to certain limitations  or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency

under the license agreement  gsk is responsible for the development  manufacture and commercialization of prescription and otc immediate release omeprazole products for sale in up to countries  outside of the us  europe  australia  japan and canada including markets within africa  asia  the middle east and central and south america 
under the distribution agreement  gsk began distributing  marketing and selling zegerid brand prescription products in puerto rico and the usvi in february during an initial period following the execution of the distribution agreement  we are obligated to supply zegerid products to gsk for sale in puerto rico and the usvi  and gsk will pay a specified transfer price covering our fully burdened costs 
gsk bears all costs for its activities under the license and distribution agreements 
under the license agreement  in december  we received an million upfront fee  and we will also receive tiered royalties  subject to reduction in certain circumstances  on net sales of any products sold under the license and distribution agreements

gsk has an option to make a buy out payment years after the effective date of the agreements  after which time  gsk s royalty obligations generally would end 
to support gsk s initial launch costs  we agreed to waive the first million of aggregate royalties payable under the license and distribution agreements 
the term of the license agreement continues so long as gsk is obligated to pay royalties  and the term of the distribution agreement continues as long as gsk sells the products  unless the agreements are terminated earlier by either gsk or us under specified circumstances

we may terminate the license agreement on a country by country basis in the event that gsk fails to satisfy certain diligence obligations 
in addition  either party may terminate the license agreement or the distribution agreement in the event of the other party s uncured material breach or bankruptcy or insolvency 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with license fees  research and development activities  including costs of clinical trial activities associated with our zegerid products  commercialization activities and general and administrative expenses 

table of contents we expect to incur additional operating losses and capital expenditures as we support the commercialization of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension and our commercial organization  enhance our product portfolio through development and commercialization of acquired or internally developed proprietary products and fund our administrative support activities 
in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge  which may entitle us to sell and obligate kingsbridge to purchase  from time to time over a period of three years  shares of our common stock for cash consideration up to the lesser of million or  shares  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
in connection with the ceff  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement and registration rights agreement  and we also issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant is fully exercisable beginning after the six month anniversary of the agreement for a period of five years thereafter 
on february   we filed a resale shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to facilitate kingsbridge s public resale of shares of our common stock which it may acquire from us from time to time in connection with our draw downs under the ceff or upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock that we issued to kingsbridge in connection with the ceff 
the resale shelf registration statement was declared effective on february  in  we completed four draw downs under the ceff and have issued a total of  shares in exchange for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
we did not initiate any draw downs under the ceff during in july  we entered into a loan agreement with comerica bank  or comerica 
the credit facility under our loan agreement consists of a revolving line of credit  pursuant to which we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed million 
as of march   the date of this report  we have not borrowed any amounts under the loan agreement 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we follow staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales  net 
we sell our zegerid products primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of products that are within six months of their expiration date or up to months beyond their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established allowances for such amounts at the time of sale 
we commercially launched zegerid capsules in late march and launched zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in late and the mg dosage strength in early we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sab no 
and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
among its criteria for revenue recognition from sale transactions where a buyer has a right of return  sfas no 
requires the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimable 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  estimated rebates in connection with contracts relating to managed care  medicaid  medicare  and patient coupons  and estimated chargebacks from distributors  wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 

table of contents we establish allowances for estimated product returns  rebates and chargebacks based primarily on the following qualitative and quantitative factors the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated remaining shelf life of products  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  direct communication with customers  historical product returns  rebates and chargebacks  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  and the impact of state and federal regulations 
in our analyses  we utilize prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize a separate analysis which compares historical product shipments less returns to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the distribution channel which may be subject to various product return  rebate and chargeback exposures 
our estimates of product returns  rebates and chargebacks require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual future payments for returns  rebates  chargebacks and other discounts exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
our allowance for product returns was million as of december  and million as of december  prior to the fourth quarter of  we deferred the recognition of revenue on product shipments of our zegerid products to wholesale distributors until units were dispensed through patient prescriptions as we were unable to reasonably estimate the amount of future product returns 
units dispensed are not generally subject to return 
prior to the fourth quarter of  our allowance for product returns was based on an analysis of zegerid product shipments to our wholesale distributors in excess of the estimated number of units dispensed through patient prescriptions 
in order to develop a methodology and provide a basis for estimating future product returns on sales to our customers at the time title transfers  we have been tracking our zegerid products return history from the time of our first commercial product launch of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in late  taking into consideration product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel 
based on the product returns history gathered over two years through the end of  we determined that we had the information needed to reasonably estimate future product returns  and as a result  we reduced our allowance for product returns during the quarter ended december  we continue to recognize product sales at the time title passes to our customers  and we provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time based upon our historical product returns trends  our analysis of product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel  and the other factors discussed above 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we receive the product return and issue credit to a customer 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
based upon our review of additional product returns history gathered through the end of and analysis of product expiration dating and inventory in the distribution channel  we increased our estimate for product returns to reflect actual experience accordingly 
this 
table of contents change in estimate provides for potential product returns related to sales in prior periods and resulted in an increase to our net loss of approximately million in consistent with industry practice  we have offered promotional discounts to our customers at the time of product launch 
these discounts are calculated as a fixed dollar discount off the current published list price and or a fixed incentive fee per transaction and are treated as off invoice allowances or customer credits 
accordingly  these discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the program is offered 
as previously discussed  at the time of product launch and prior to the fourth quarter of  we deferred the recognition of revenue on shipments of our zegerid products to wholesale distributors until units were dispensed through patient prescriptions 
as a result  we did not recognize product sales related to inventory in the distribution channel 
our allowance for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts was million as of december  and million as of december  these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts  rebates due to various governmental organizations under medicaid and medicare contracts and regulations  chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements  and other rebates and customer discounts due in connection with wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a combination of the qualitative and quantitative assumptions listed above 
in each reporting period  we evaluate our outstanding contracts and apply the contractual discounts to the invoiced price of wholesaler shipments recognized 
although the total invoiced price of shipments to wholesalers for the reporting period and the contractual terms are known during the reporting period  we project the ultimate disposition of the sale eg future utilization rates of cash payors  managed care  medicaid  medicare or other contracted organizations 
this estimate is based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes based on specific contractual terms of new agreements with customers  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors and the other qualitative and quantitative factors described above 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we make the contractual payment or issue credit to a customer 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
to date  actual results have not materially differed from our estimates 
contract revenue 
we recognize contract revenue consistent with the provisions of sab no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we analyze each element of our licensing and co promotion agreements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on upfront payments over the period of significant involvement under the related agreements unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services rendered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and no further performance obligation exists under the contract 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are nonrefundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recognized as deferred revenue 
sales milestones  royalties and co promotion fees are recognized as revenue when earned under the agreements 
certain elements of our licensing and co promotion agreements are described below in december  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our license and distribution agreements with gsk 
to support gsk s initial launch costs  we agreed to waive the first million of aggregate royalties payable under the agreements 
of the total million upfront payment  the million in waived royalty obligations was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue when the royalties are earned 
the remaining million is being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over an month period  which represents the estimated period we are obligated to supply zegerid products to gsk for sale in puerto rico and the usvi under the distribution agreement 
in august  we received a nonrefundable million milestone payment relating to progress on clinical product development strategy under our license agreement with schering plough 
the million milestone payment was recognized as contract revenue in due to the substantive nature of the milestone achieved and since we have no ongoing obligations associated with the milestone 

table of contents in november  we received a nonrefundable million upfront license fee in connection with our license agreement with schering plough 
the million upfront payment is being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over a month period through the end of  which represents the estimated period during which we have significant responsibilities under the agreement 
in february  we received a million milestone payment in connection with our sublicense agreement with tap pharmaceutical products inc  or tap 
we received the milestone payment after we prevailed in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which we alleged that tap had achieved a development milestone 
pursuant to our license agreement with the university of missouri  we paid of the february milestone to the university of missouri 
in addition to the provisions of sab no 
and eitf issue no 
 we evaluated the criteria outlined in eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it was appropriate to record the gross amount of sublicense revenues and related costs or the net amount earned under the arrangement 
upon receipt of the milestone  we recognized the gross amount of sublicense revenue and related costs as we had no future obligations pursuant to the arrangement  we were the primary obligor in the arrangement  we had latitude in establishing the amounts received under the arrangement  and we were involved in the determination of the scope of technology sublicensed under the agreement 
tap exercised its rights to terminate the sublicense agreement effective march  in october  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our co promotion agreement with otsuka america 
the million upfront payment is being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the month contractual term through the end of inventories and related reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost fifo or market and consist of finished goods and raw materials used in the manufacture of our zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension products 
also included in inventories are product samples of the naprelan products which we purchase from victory under our co promotion agreement 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized for and included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is generally shorter than the expected life of the option  we consider the expected volatility of similar entities as well as our historical volatility since our initial public offering in april in determining our volatility factor 
in evaluating similar entities  we consider factors such as industry  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
in determining the expected life of the options  we use the short cut method described in sab no 
under this method  the expected life is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
for options granted prior to january   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the

for the year ended december   stock based compensation of approximately  million and million was included in cost of sales  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  in the accompanying statement of operations 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately million  and the weighted average period over which it was expected to be recognized was years 
in october  our board of directors approved certain equity compensation programs for employees below the vice president level which became effective on november  with the intent of positively impacting employee morale  these programs included the granting of options to purchase an aggregate total of  shares of our common stock as well as accelerating the vesting of out of the money existing stock options with per share exercise prices of or greater 
additionally  the decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made to reduce the total stock based compensation in our statement of operations in future financial statements relating to options granted to employees below the vice president level 
we recognized million in stock based compensation expense associated with the stock option vesting acceleration on november  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales  net 
product sales  net were million for and million for and consisted of sales of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
the million increase in product sales  net from to was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of zegerid capsules which we commercially launched in late march for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   the amount of rebates  chargebacks and other discounts has grown primarily as a result of increased sales of our zegerid products and increased contracting with various managed care organizations and governmental organizations relating to medicaid and medicare 
accordingly  reductions to revenue and corresponding increases to allowance accounts have likewise increased 
additionally  based upon our review of additional product returns history gathered through the end of and analysis of product expiration dating and estimated inventory in the distribution channel  we increased our estimate for product returns to reflect actual experience accordingly 
this change in estimate provides for potential product returns related to sales in prior periods and resulted in an increase to our net loss of approximately million 
product sales  net were million for and consisted of sales of zegerid powder for oral suspension 
contract revenue 
contract revenue was million for  million for and million for contract revenue in each period consisted of co promotion revenue from the million upfront fee received pursuant to our co promotion agreement with otsuka america entered into in october  which is being amortized to revenue over the term of the agreement through december  in and  contract revenue also included license fee revenue from the million upfront fee received in november pursuant to 
table of contents our license agreement with schering plough 
this upfront fee is being amortized to revenue through the end of  which is the estimated period over which we have significant responsibilities under the agreement 
contract revenue in also included license fee revenue from the million upfront fee received in pursuant to our license and distribution agreements with gsk 
of this million upfront fee  million is being amortized to revenue over our product supply obligation through may in addition  contract revenue in included the million milestone payment received in august pursuant to our license agreement with schering plough and co promotion fees earned under our co promotion agreements with victory and fleet 
in  contract revenue also included sublicense revenue which consisted of the million milestone payment we received from tap in february related to tap s development activities 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million for  million for and million for  or approximately  and of net product sales  respectively 
cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  freight and indirect personnel and other overhead costs associated with the sales of our zegerid products 
cost of sales also includes reserves for excess  dated or obsolete commercial inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
the decrease in our cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales from to and from to was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing costs associated with our capsule product and certain fixed costs being applied to increased sales volumes 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties were million for  million for and million for license fees and royalties consisted of royalties due to the university of missouri and otsuka america based upon net product sales 
additionally  in  license fees and royalties included million paid to the university of missouri  which represented of the milestone fee received pursuant to our sublicense agreement with tap 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  million for and million for the  decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in manufacturing development activities associated with the capsule and chewable tablet products and a decrease in stock based compensation  offset in part by spending associated with our clinical trial evaluating the effects of morning dosing of each of zegerid capsules and delayed release ppi brands  protonix and prevacid  on hour gastric acid control in patients with symptoms of gerd 
the million decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in manufacturing development activities associated with the chewable tablet product and a decrease in compensation costs associated with research and development personnel resulting from a reduction in headcount 
research and development expenses have consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our products under development as well as clinical studies designed to further differentiate our zegerid products from those of our competitors  development of and preparation for commercial manufacturing of our products  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses 
in the future  we may conduct additional clinical trials to further differentiate our zegerid family of products  as well as conduct research and development related to any future products that we may in license or otherwise acquire 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the research and development costs that we may incur in the future 
we have also committed  in connection with the approval of our ndas for zegerid powder for oral suspension  to evaluate the product in pediatric populations  including pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic  or pk pd  and safety studies 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing our zegerid family of products  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific  clinical and commercial merits of each project

we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next months  however  our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our cash resources being consumed earlier than we expect 
although we do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds to finance our current operations over the next months  we may pursue raising additional funds in connection with licensing or acquisition of new products 
sources of additional funds may include funds generated through strategic collaboration or licensing agreements  or through equity  debt and or royalty financing 
in may  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective in june in august  we sold  shares of our common stock that were registered under the universal shelf registration statement for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
the universal shelf registration statement may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to an additional approximately million of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include the progress of our commercial activities  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets  among others

we did not initiate any draw downs under the ceff during accordingly  the remaining commitment of kingsbridge under the ceff for the potential purchase of our common stock is equal to the lesser of million in cash consideration or  shares which shares would be priced at a discount ranging from to of the average market price during any future draw down  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any further draw downs under the ceff

table of contents in july  we entered into our loan agreement with comerica  pursuant to which we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed million 
as of march   the date of this report  we have not borrowed any amounts under the loan agreement 
under the loan agreement  the revolving loan bears interest  as selected by us  at either the variable rate of interest  per annum  most recently announced by comerica as its prime rate or the libor rate as computed in the libor addendum to the loan agreement plus percent 
interest payments on advances made under the loan agreement are due and payable in arrears on the first calendar day of each month during the term of the loan agreement 
amounts borrowed under the loan agreement may be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to july  the loan agreement will remain in full force and effect for so long as any obligations remain outstanding or comerica has any obligation to make credit extensions under the loan agreement 
we expect to use the loan proceeds to support our ongoing working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the loan agreement are secured by all of our personal property 
the collateral does not include any intellectual property  including copyrights  patents  trademarks  servicemarks and applications therefor  now owned or hereafter acquired  or any claims for damages by way of any past  present and future infringement of any such intellectual property  provided  however  that the collateral includes all accounts and general intangibles that consist of rights to payment and proceeds from the sale  licensing or disposition of all or any part  or rights in  such intellectual property 
under the loan agreement  we are subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to convey  sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets  to create  incur  assume  guarantee or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness  to grant liens  to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments  and to make investments 
in addition  under the loan agreement we are required to maintain a balance of cash with comerica in an amount of not less than million and to maintain any other cash balances with either comerica or another financial institution covered by a control agreement for the benefit of comerica 
we are also subject to certain financial covenants with respect to a minimum liquidity ratio and  when the outstanding loan balances exceed million  minimum ebitda requirements 
we believe that we have currently met all of our obligations under the loan agreement 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate to sustain our current operations 
to the extent we require additional funding  we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
for example  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through collaboration  licensing or other similar arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
if adequate funds are not available on terms acceptable to us at that time  our ability to continue our current operations or pursue new product opportunities would be significantly limited 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election

however  the presentation and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are required to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the retrospective presentation and disclosure requirements of this statement will be applied to any prior periods presented in financial statements for the fiscal year ending december   and later periods during which we had a consolidated subsidiary with a non controlling interest

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the terms of our loan agreement with comerica  the interest rate applicable to any amounts borrowed by us under the credit facility will be  at our election  indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
if we elect comerica s prime rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  the interest rate will be variable  which would expose us to the risk of increased interest expense if interest rates rise 
if we elect the libor rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  such libor rate will remain fixed only for a specified  limited period of time after the date of our election  after which we will be required to repay the borrowed amount  or elect a new interest rate indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
the new rate may be higher than the earlier interest rate applicable under the loan agreement 
as of march   the date of this report  we have not borrowed any amounts under the loan agreement 
accordingly  we currently believe that changes in such interest rates would not materially affect our market risk 
in addition to market risk related to our loan agreement with comerica  we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in us interest rates and conditions in the credit markets  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
our investment securities consist of high grade auction rate securities  corporate debt securities and government agency securities 
as of december   our short term investments included million of high grade aaa rated auction rate securities issued by state municipalities 
our auction rate securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and an interest rate that is reset in short term intervals through auctions 
the recent conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to predetermined higher rates 
when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or mature 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
to date  we have not recorded any realized gains or losses on our investment portfolio or recognized any significant unrealized gains or losses on investments
