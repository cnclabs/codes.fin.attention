investors are cautioned that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed below 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we own and operate integrated colocation facilities and diverse transport routes in the two gateway markets of new york new jersey and los angeles 
our customized connectivity infrastructure provides an advanced  high bandwidth  fiber optic solution to support the demand for network capacity and to facilitate the interconnection of multiple customers networks 
factors affecting future operations revenues 
we generate revenues from selling network capacity  colocation and related services to other communications service providers 
revenues are derived from four general types of services on net transport services 
our transport services include the offering of broadband circuits on our metropolitan transport networks and fibernet in building networks fins 
over our metropolitan transport networks  we can provision circuits from one of our carrier hotel facilities to another carrier hotel facility or to an on net building via an interconnection with our fin in that building 
we can also provision circuits vertically between floors in a carrier hotel facility or an on net building 
in addition  we provide other interconnection services  including hubbing to aggregate lower bandwidth endlink circuits into a single  higher bandwidth circuit as well as protocol and signaling conversion to exchange traffic between domestic and international circuits and next generation ethernet  ip and voip technologies 
off net transport services 
we provide our customers with circuits on networks that we do not own 
customers purchase these services from us to benefit from our network design  provisioning and management expertise 
we sell this connectivity to our customers by purchasing the underlying circuits from other wholesale telecommunications carriers 
by bundling these services with our on net transport services and colocation services  we are able to provide a full range of network services to our customers 
colocation services 
our colocation services include providing customers with customized cages  cabinets and racks to locate their communications and networking equipment at certain of our carrier hotel facilities in a secure  technical operating environment 
we can also provide our customers with colocation services in the central equipment rooms of certain of our commercial office buildings 
communications access management services 
our access management services entail providing our customers with access to provide their retail communications services to tenants in certain commercial office buildings 
our revenues are typically generated on a monthly recurring basis under contracts with our customers 
the terms of these contracts can range from month to month to years in length 
our customers typically elect to purchase network services for an initial contract period of one year with month to month renewals 
all of our revenues are generated in the united states of america 
our services are typically sold under fixed price agreements 
in the case of transport services  we provide an optical circuit or other means of connectivity for a fixed price 
revenues from transport services are not dependent on customer usage or the distance between the origination point and termination point of a circuit 
the pricing of colocation services is based upon the size of the colocation space or the number of colocation units  such as cabinets  provided to the customer 
revenues from access management services are typically determined by the square footage of the commercial office properties to which a customer purchases access 
we have experienced price declines for some of our services over the past year due to industry trends  with transport services experiencing the greatest decreases 
our operating results may continue to be impacted by decreases in the prices of certain of our services 
we believe that the majority of the growth in our revenues will come from our existing customers 
while we continue to add additional customers  particularly domestic subsidiaries of internationally based carriers  we believe the number of companies that are potential customers is not increasing due to industry consolidation 
consequently  our growth in revenue is largely dependent on the underlying growth of our customers businesses and their need for our services 
the growth of our on net transport and colocation revenues is also dependent in part upon our ability to provide additional services in our existing facilities and our current markets 
we are currently expanding our colocation footprint in the new york city market  and over the long term  we intend to derive additional colocation revenues  as well as increased transport revenues  from this expansion 
as a result  within each of our facilities and markets  our revenues will depend upon the demand for our services  the competition that we face and our customer service 
we typically begin our sales cycle by entering into a master services agreement 
this document outlines the legal and business terms  operating specifications and commercial standards that are required of us by the customer 
after entering into the master service agreement  customers can order specific services from us through individual sales orders 
customers primarily purchase services from us when their requirements mandate an immediate need for additional services  either for their own internal network use or for access to their customers or other vendors 
as their demand for network connectivity or colocation grows  we benefit by providing new services to them 
we also experience disconnections of services  as customers groom their networks to eliminate excess capacity or adjust their changing network requirements 
this loss of revenues may negatively impact our financial results 
our on net transport services primarily provide network core connectivity to our customers  enabling them to exchange traffic between their own points of presence or from one of their points of presence to that of another carrier or service provider 
these services accounted for of our total revenues in we can provide on net transport services utilizing multiple transmission protocols  including legacy north american standards  international standards and new technologies  such as ethernet  ip and voip 
our ability to provide service using varying standards  as well as to interconnect traffic between standards  is an important factor in the growth of our on net transport business 
another key factor in the growth of our on net transport business is the large number of nodes on our network and the resulting number of carriers that we can interconnect with 
it is important for us to be able to exchange traffic directly with many other carriers in order to offer the greatest value to our customers  by enabling a single interconnection with us to deliver connectivity to a significant number of other carriers 
additionally  the scalability of our network architecture allows us to increase transport capacity to a greater degree than is possible with our other services  yielding incremental operating leverage from our existing infrastructure and facilities 
we are able to expand capacity in part due to technological advancements in fiber optics  such as dense wave division multiplexing or dwdm 
our off net transport services constitute network connectivity that we provide to our customers  utilizing circuits that we purchase from other wholesale telecommunications carriers 
these services produced of our total revenues in and are the fastest growing portion of our business 
in providing these services to our customers  we manage all aspects of the service delivery  including network design  installation  monitoring and troubleshooting 
our ability to bundle these services with our other offerings allows our customers to utilize a single vendor for their network requirements 
we offer these services in markets that we currently serve with our own infrastructure  in other metropolitan markets that we do not serve with our own networks  and on a long haul basis to connect metropolitan areas  significantly increasing our addressable market beyond the metropolitan markets in which we own network infrastructure and facilities 
historically our transport services have been negatively impacted by customers disconnecting higher bandwidth circuits and replacing them with lower bandwidth circuits to more efficiently manage the access costs of their networks 
the new transport services that we are providing typically are also for lower bandwidth circuits  as our customers expand their network connections on a more prudent basis 
the growth in transport revenues that we have experienced on a quarterly basis in and is a result of an increase in the number of circuits that we have provisioned  which more than offset disconnections and price declines 
in the future  we anticipate generating significantly more of our revenues from transport services than from the other services we provide 
our colocation services produced of our total revenues in colocation revenues are generally stable in nature  as customers tend to maintain a more consistent need for a location to house their networking equipment and therefore typically enter into three to five years contracts for colocation services 
upon purchasing colocation space from us  customers secure their network equipment in our highly conditioned facilities and establish connectivity to exchange traffic with other networks 
our facilities maintain rigorous standards for power  cooling  security  reliability and other environmental controls 
it is the physical constraints of available colocation space in our facilities and our competitors facilities that have created a favorable market environment for colocation services 
the growth prospects of our colocation services are a function of the space that we have available to sell to our customers 
many of our existing colocation facilities are approaching stabilized occupancy rates 
as a result  we constructed a new  square foot facility at hudson street in new york city 
we are also converting  square feet of currently unoccupied colocation space at our location at halsey street in newark  new jersey into an internet grade facility with enhanced power capacity to also expand our offering capabilities 
our access management services business accounted for of our total revenues in and has been steadily declining 
we expect that trend to continue 
the revenues that we are generating from this type of service are from long term contracts entered into in prior years 
we do not expect to sign any new contracts for access management in the near future 
the remaining terms of our existing access management service contracts range from a month to month basis to expiration in cost of services 
cost of services is associated with the operation of our networks and facilities 
the largest component of our cost of services is the occupancy expenses at our carrier hotel facilities and commercial office buildings 
these occupancy expenses primarily represent rent expense  utility costs and license fees under direct leases with landlords 
they also include charges for colocation space in other carriers facilities and cross connection fees to interconnect our networks with other carriers networks 
most of our license agreements for our commercial office buildings require us to pay license fees to the owners of these properties 
in addition  our two leases at hudson street in new york city require us to pay license fees 
these license fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the revenues that we generate in each particular building 
in addition  we incur off net connectivity charges for the costs of purchasing connectivity from other wholesale telecommunications carriers to provide our customers with transport services on networks that we do not own 
as we provide additional off net transport services  we will purchase more connectivity from other carriers 
other specific costs of services include maintenance and repair costs 
with the exception of off net connectivity charges and license fees  we do not anticipate that cost of services will change commensurately with any change in our revenues as our cost of services is generally fixed in nature 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all of our personnel costs  stock related costs  occupancy costs for our corporate offices  insurance costs  professional fees  sales and marketing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
personnel costs  including wages  benefits and sales commissions  are our largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
stock related expenses relate to the granting of stock options and restricted stock to our employees 
we make equity grants to our employees in order to attract  retain and incentivize qualified personnel 
these costs are non cash charges that are amortized over the vesting term of each employee s equity agreement  based on the fair value on the date of the grant 
we do not allocate any personnel cost relating to network operations or sales activities to our cost of services 
we had employees as of december  compared to as of december  prospectively  we believe that our personnel costs will increase moderately 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses and consulting fees  represent the second largest component of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
these legal and accounting fees are primarily attributed to our required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings and financial statement audits  and could increase prospectively due to the enhanced regulations regarding corporate governance and compliance matters 
other costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses  such as insurance costs  occupancy costs related to our office space  and marketing costs  may increase due to changes in the economic environment and telecommunications industry 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of our network equipment and infrastructure  computer hardware and software  office equipment and furniture  and leasehold improvements  as well as the amortization of certain deferred charges 
we commence the depreciation of network related fixed assets when they are placed into service and depreciate those assets over periods ranging from three to years 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results from operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the estimates that we have made on an on going basis 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  an allowance for doubtful accounts  the impairment of long lived assets and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when earned as services are provided throughout the life of each sales order with a customer 
the majority of our revenues are invoiced on a monthly recurring basis under sales orders that are typically one year in length 
certain of our contracts require us to invoice our customers for the periods ranging from one year to the full term of the contract 
we record deferred revenue for the amount of an invoice that has been paid and not recognized as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a number of our customers filed for bankruptcy or were otherwise in financial distress 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a deterioration in the economic environment or telecommunications industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  we fully reserve the receivable and reverse that reserve only when collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the telecommunications industry and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  fin no 
requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position 
if the more likely than not threshold is met  we must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulation in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the balance sheets and statements of income 
at the adoption date of january   we had no unrecognized tax benefits which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
at december   we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
we classify interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statement of income under selling  general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the tax years through remain open to examination by all taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject

the new loan  which was unfunded at closing  supplements and is made a part of our existing million credit facility described above 
the new loan bears interest at floating rates  depending on the type of borrowing and based on either a prime rate or libor rate  as such terms are defined under the credit facility 
the applicable margin based upon a libor rate is  and the applicable margin based on a prime rate is 
in addition  the parties adjusted certain of the financial covenants under the credit facility 
the new loan will be payable in equal quarterly installments of of the principal amount commencing in april  with the entire credit facility maturing in march on november   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  either through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of the shares to be repurchased will be based on market conditions and other factors  including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and alternative investment opportunities 
any shares repurchased in the program will be cancelled 
the repurchase program is scheduled to terminate on december   and may be modified or discontinued at any time

license fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the revenues we generate in the respective facility  as per our lease agreement with the facility 
on august   we adopted the fibernet telecom group  inc change in control plan the plan 
pursuant to the terms of the plan  members of senior management are entitled to certain benefits upon a termination of employment other than a termination by fibernet for cause or by an employee without good reason as such terms are defined in the plan that occurs within one year after a change in control event as defined in the plan 
specifically  each vice president and senior vice president shall be entitled to a cash payment of of his or her current base salary and the president shall be entitled to a cash payment of of his or her current base salary  plus a pro rated portion of his or her annual bonus
