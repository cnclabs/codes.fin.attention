item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in cautionary statements regarding forward looking information and elsewhere in this report 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the company s statements of operations as a percentage of total net sales 
year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling marketing warrant expense selling marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income income loss before taxes income tax benefit net income loss critical accounting policies our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from insignia popsigns ratably over the period of service  which is either a two week or four week display cycle 
we recognize revenue related to equipment  software and sign card sales at the time the products are shipped to customers 
revenue associated with maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue that has been billed and not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors could result in materially different amounts 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 or fas  accounting for income taxes  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fas no 
fin requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at december   the company determined that it was appropriate to recognize approximately million of its deferred tax assets through reversal of its valuation allowance 
this leaves approximately million of the company s net deferred tax assets being offset with a valuation allowance 
the company cannot be certain that it will be more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in future years 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options and employee stock purchase plan rights 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected terms of the options and employee stock purchase plan rights are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date 
volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of the company s stock 
the company has not historically issued any dividends and does not expect to in the future 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of the grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r to grants in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current periods
