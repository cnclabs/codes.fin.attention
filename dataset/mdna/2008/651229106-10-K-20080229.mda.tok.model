the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits 
as a large taxpayer  the company is under continual audit by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions  and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year 
while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the million in unrecognized tax benefits at december  is excluded from the preceding table

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in that footnote  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe the company s critical accounting policies 
sales recognition sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change  which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms 
sales are net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts  cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 
recovery of accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
accounts are reviewed for potential write off on a case by case basis 
accounts deemed uncollectible are written off  net of expected recoveries 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
as of december   the company had allowances for doubtful accounts of million on  million of accounts receivable 

table of contents inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company conducts its annual test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually at the operating segment level herein referred to as the reporting unit 
the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value  impairment may be present 
the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill based on discounted cash flow models  earnings multiples or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer  if available 
the use of a discounted cash flow model involves several assumptions  and changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates 
assumptions critical to the company s fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate  projected average revenue growth  projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values  and product costs 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair values of our reporting units  which were not deemed to be impaired based on the testing of goodwill in the third quarter as described above  would not cause the carrying value of any reporting unit to exceed its fair value 
the company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company also evaluates indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually 
the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount 
assumptions critical to the company s evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate  royalty rates used in its evaluation of trade names  projected average revenue growth  and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 
no impairment charges were recorded by the company as a result of the annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of and the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
capitalized software costs the company capitalizes costs associated with internal use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development 
capitalized internal use software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software  ii payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project  and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software 
capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
the company expenses as incurred research and development  general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internal use software 
in addition  the company expenses as incurred training  maintenance and other internal use software costs incurred during the post implementation stage 
costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal use 
table of contents software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software 
capitalized software costs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december  or the company amortizes internal use software costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software 
capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used 
impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values at the date of evaluation 
other long lived assets the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present 
these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
if impairment indicators are present  the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets 
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount 
the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company s strategic plan 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
generally  the company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level  as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
product liability reserves the company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance 
the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves 
the company s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company s product liability reserve 
the company has product liability reserves of million as of december  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company  and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  as well as contract and other disputes 
the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters 
the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to long term operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability cercla matters which are estimated at present value 
the company s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december  ranged between million and million 
as of december   the company had a reserve of million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate  which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the 
table of contents financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 
the company s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken  which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
the company s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company s effective tax rate  as well as impact operating results 
the adoption of fin did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings  however it did result in the reclassification of certain income tax assets and liabilities from current to long term in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
pensions and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increase  discussed below discount rates the company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
health care cost trend rate the company s health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data  near term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
expected return on plan assets the company s expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes 
the company s analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  however  the assumptions are primarily based on long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience 
rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increase reflects the company s long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued staff positions and which remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas and partially defer the effective date of sfas for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company prospectively adopted the effective provisions of sfas on january  the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

these statements generally are accompanied by words such as intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  project  target  plan  expect  will  should  would or similar statements 
the company cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include  but are not limited to  those matters set forth in this report generally and item a to this report 
some of these factors are described as criteria for success 
the company s failure to achieve  or limited success in achieving  these objectives could result in actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and  for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form offsetting or netting of like foreign currency flows  structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk  converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
in addition  the company primarily utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany 
table of contents transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the company purchases certain raw materials  including resin  corrugate  steel  stainless steel  aluminum and other metals  which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors 
while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain  a variety of programs  including periodic raw material purchases  purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk 
where practical  the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition  but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december  and dollars in millions december  december  confidence market risk average average level interest rates foreign exchange commodity price risk is not shown because the amounts are not material 
the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets
