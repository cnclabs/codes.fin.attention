item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation summary we are a specialty finance company organized as a mortgage real estate investment trust reit 
we invest principally in single family residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities  both investment grade and non investment grade rated 
residential mortgage securities are typically referred to as rmbs and commercial mortgage securities are typically referred to as cmbs 
we finance loans and rmbs and cmbs securities through a combination of non recourse securitization financing  repurchase agreements and equity 
we employ financing in order to increase the overall yield on our invested capital 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the excess of the interest income earned on our investments over the cost of financing these investments 
we typically intend to hold securities to their maturity but may occasionally record gains or losses from the sale of investments prior to their maturity 
in recent years  we have elected to sell certain non core assets  including investments in manufactured housing loans and delinquent property tax receivable portfolios  as well as to contribute certain of our interests in a commercial mortgage loan securitization trust to a joint venture  in order to reduce our exposure to credit risk on these assets  increase our capital available for new investments  and strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our overall leverage 
our emphasis on strengthening the balance sheet and developing investment partnerships  through joint ventures and other means  has been in anticipation of redeploying our invested capital in more compelling investment opportunities 
over the last several years  we have been able to steadily increase our book value per common share while improving the quality of our investment assets and reducing financial leverage 
we have also been able to improve our net income to common shareholders at the same time 
during  we earned net income of million  and net income to common shareholders of million 
as a reit  we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income 
however  we may offset all or a portion of our reit taxable income with our nol carryforwards 
in  we received a capital distribution of million from our investment in our joint venture 
we used these funds primarily to reduce one of our two outstanding repurchase agreements 
during the fourth quarter of  we reissued a securitization bond that was initially issued in april and redeemed in april we received proceeds of million on the reissuance 
approximately million of the resulting cash receipts was used to pay down our repurchase agreement balance 
the remaining million increased the company s liquidity and is available to be invested or used for other general corporate purposes 
financial condition the following table presents certain balance sheet items that had significant activity  which are discussed after the table 
december  amounts in thousands investments securitized mortgage loans  net investment in joint venture securities securitization financing repurchase agreements shareholders equity securitized mortgage loans  net securitized mortgage loans are comprised of loans secured by first deeds of trust on single family residential and commercial properties 
the following table presents our net basis in these loans at amortized cost  which includes accrued interest receivable  discounts  premiums  deferred costs and reserves for loan losses  by the type of property collateralizing the loan 
amounts in thousands securitized mortgage loans  net commercial single family securitized commercial mortgage loans includes the loans in two securitization trusts we issued in and  which have outstanding principal balances of million and million  respectively  at december  the decrease in these loans was primarily related to scheduled and unscheduled principal payments of million and million  respectively 
the large amount of prepayments during the year is related to favorable commercial loan rates available in the market during the year and the declining prepayment penalties to which the loans are subject as the loans approach the end of their yield maintenance periods 
we also recaptured approximately million of amounts previously provided for losses on these commercial mortgage loans as a result of a decrease in estimated losses on the commercial loan portfolio and charged off approximately million of losses against the allowance in securitized single family mortgage loans includes loans in one securitization trust we issued in using loans that were principally originated between and the decrease in the single family mortgage loans is related to principal payments on the loans of million  million of which was unscheduled 
although prepayments slowed on the single family mortgage loans during the year  the portfolio continues to have excellent credit performance demonstrated by the significant decrease in the percentage of single family loans more than days delinquent from at december  to at december  as well as having less than million of charge offs during investment in joint venture the decrease in our investment in the joint venture is primarily related to an million distribution we received from the joint venture during  which was made in order to distribute excess uninvested capital in accordance with the joint venture s operating agreement 
recognizing our interest in the earnings of the joint venture of million increased our investment in the joint venture but was offset by the recognition of million for our interest in the other comprehensive loss of the joint venture associated with the decrease in value of the joint venture s available for sale securities 
securities our securities  which are classified as available for sale and carried at their fair value  are comprised of the following amounts in thousands securities non agency rmbs agency rmbs equity securities corporate debt securities non agency rmbs declined by approximately million to million at december  the decrease was primarily related to the principal payments received on these securities during the year 
agency rmbs increased by million to million at december  this increase was primarily the result of the purchase of a million agency rmbs during the fourth quarter of  which was partially offset by the receipt of million of principal on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio during the year 
equity securities increased approximately million and include preferred stock and common stock issued by publicly traded mortgage reits 
we purchased approximately million of equity securities during the year and sold million on which we recognized a gain of million 
we also purchased a senior unsecured convertible note issued by a publicly traded reit with a par value of million during the year 
the note had an estimated fair value of million at december securitization financing securitization financing are bonds issued by a securitization trust  which we sponsored and is consolidated in our financial statements 
these bonds are secured only by the securitized mortgage loans pledged to the trust and are otherwise non recourse to us 
principal and interest on the bonds are paid from the cash flows generated by the loans collateralizing the bonds 
the following table presents our net basis  which includes accrued interest  discounts  premiums and deferred costs in securitization financing 
amounts in thousands securitization financing bonds fixed  secured by commercial mortgage loans variable  secured by single family mortgage loans the fixed rate bonds finance our securitized commercial mortgage loans  which are also fixed rate 
the million decrease is primarily related to principal payments on the bonds during of million 
there was also million of net amortization of bond premiums and deferred costs 
approximately million of these bonds are callable by us in june of those bonds have premiums and deferred costs associated with them  representing a net credit of approximately million  which are being amortized over life of the bonds 
if we choose to call those bonds in  any unamortized premium and deferred costs would be written off and recognized as a gain at that time 
our single family securitized mortgage loans are financed by variable rate securitization financing bonds 
we redeemed all of the bonds issued by this securitization trust in  financing the redemption with repurchase agreements and our own capital  and held the bonds for potential reissue 
during the fourth quarter of  we reissued one of these bonds at a million discount to its par value of million generating proceeds of million 
payments of million were made on this bond subsequent to its reissuance 
we still hold a second bond issued by this trust  which had a par value of million at december  and is partially financed with repurchase agreements  which are discussed below 
as the securitization trust which issued this bond is consolidated in our financial statements  this bond is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
repurchase agreements the decline in repurchase agreements from the prior year was a result of million of payments during the repurchase agreement outstanding at december  of million is financing the senior class bond issued by our single family securitization trust  which at december  had a par value and fair value of million and million  respectively 
shareholders equity shareholders equity increased by million to million primarily due to net income to shareholders of million and unrealized gains on investments of million  which is net of realized gains on sales of equity securities of million 
supplemental discussion of investments we manage our investment portfolio in large part based on our net capital invested in a particular investment 
net capital invested  which is referred to as net investment in the table below  is generally defined as the cost basis of the investment net of the associated financing securitization financing or repurchase agreement for that investment 
below is the net investment basis as of december  we also estimate on a periodic basis the fair value of this net investment 
the fair value of our net investment in securitized mortgage loans is based on the present value of the projected cash flow from the loan collateral  adjusted for the impact and assumed level of future prepayments and credit losses  less the projected principal and interest due on the associated securitization financing bonds owned by third parties 
the fair value of securities is based on quotes obtained from third party dealers or is calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows at estimated market rates where no dealer quotes are available 
we believe the fair value of net investment presented in the table below is a reasonable approximation of our net asset value  excluding other assets and other liabilities which are not included in the table below 
december  amounts in thousands amortized cost basis financing net investment fair value of net investment securitized mortgage loans single family mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans allowance for loan losses securities investment grade rmbs non investment grade rmbs equity and other investment in joint venture obligation under payment agreement other loans and investments net unrealized gain total fair values for securitized mortgage loans and the obligation under payment agreement are based on discounted cash flows using assumptions set forth in the table below  inclusive of amounts invested in redeemed securitization financing bonds 
fair values are based on dealer quotes  if available  and closing prices from a national exchange where applicable 
approximately million of fair value of securities were based on available dealer quotes or closing prices from a national exchange 
where dealer quotes are not available  fair values are calculated as the net present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at a weighted average discount rate of for investment grade securities and for non investment grade securities 
fair value for investment in joint venture represents our share of the fair value of the joint venture s assets valued using methodologies and assumptions consistent with note above 
financing includes securitization financing issued to third parties and repurchase agreements 
the following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating fair value  pursuant to note in the table above  for our net investment in securitized mortgage loans and the cash flow related to those net investments during fair value assumptions loan type weighted average prepayment speeds losses weighted average discount rate projected cash flow termination date amounts in thousands cash flows single family mortgage loans cpr annually anticipated final maturity commercial mortgage loans annually represents the excess of the cash flows received on the collateral pledged over the cash flow required to service the related securitization financing 
these cash flows exclude the net principal and interest received on the senior single family bond we owned at december  includes loans pledged to two different securitization trusts 
assumed constant prepayment rate cpr speeds generally are governed by underlying pool characteristics  prepayment lock out provisions  and yield maintenance provisions 
loans currently delinquent in excess of days are assumed to be liquidated in six months at a loss amount that is calculated for each loan based on its specific facts 
weighed average discount rates for the two securitization trusts were and  respectively 
cash flow termination dates are modeled based on the repayment dates of the loans or optional redemption dates of the underlying securitization financing bonds 
represents management s estimate of the market discount rate that would be used by a third party in valuing these or similar assets 
the following table presents the net investment basis included in the first table above by their rating classification 
investments in the unrated and non investment grade classification primarily include equity securities and commercial mortgage and single family mortgage loans  which are unrated but are substantially seasoned and performing 
securitization over collateralization generally includes the excess of the securitized mortgage loans pledged over the outstanding bonds issued by the securitization trust 
the joint venture owns primarily interest in non investment grade cmbs 
december  amounts in thousands investments aaa rated and agency rmbs fixed income securities aa and a rated rmbs unrated and non investment grade securitization over collateralization investment in joint venture supplemental discussion of common equity book value we believe that our shareholders  as well as shareholders of other companies in the mortgage reit industry  consider book value per common share an important measure 
our reported book value per common share is based on the carrying value our assets and liabilities as recorded in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a substantial portion of our assets are carried on a historical  or amortized  cost basis and not at estimated fair value 
the first table included in the supplemental discussion of investments section above compares the amortized cost basis of our investments to their estimated fair value based on assumptions set forth in the second table 
we believe that book value per common share  adjusted to reflect the carrying value of investments at their fair value hereinafter referred to as adjusted common equity book value  is also a meaningful measure for our shareholders  representing effectively our estimated going concern net asset value 
the following table calculates adjusted common equity book value and adjusted common equity book value per share using the estimated fair value information contained in the estimated fair value of net investment table above 
the amounts set forth in the table in the adjusted book value column include all of our financial assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values  and exclude any value attributable to our nol carryforwards and other matters that might impact our value 
december  amounts in thousands except per share information book value adjusted book value total investment assets cash and cash equivalents other assets and liabilities  net less preferred stock liquidation preference common equity book value and adjusted book value common equity book value per share and adjusted book value per share discussion of credit risk as discussed in item a risk factors above  the predominent risk in our investment portfolio today is credit risk ie  the risk that we will not receive all amounts contractually due us on an investment as a result of a default by the borrower and the resulting deficiency in proceeds from the liquidation of the collateral securing the obligation 
in many instances  we retained the first loss credit risk on pools of loans and securities that we have securitized 
in addition to our retained interests in certain securitizations  we also have credit risk on approximately million of unrated or non investment grade mortgage securities and loans 
the following table summarizes our credit exposure in securitized mortgage loans and subordinate mortgage securities 
credit reserves and actual credit losses amounts in millions credit exposure credit exposure  net of allowance actual credit losses credit exposure  net of allowance to outstanding loan balance represents the overcollateralization pledged to a securitization trust and subordinate securities we own  net of any discounts 
represents credit exposure  net of allowance for loan losses 
represents credit exposure net of allowance divided by current unpaid principal balance of loans in the securitization trust our net credit exposure decreased from to primarily as a result of the derecognition of million of securitized commercial mortgage loans in the increase in our net credit exposure in is primarily due to reduction in the balance of allowance for loan losses of million as a result of the improved performance of our securitized commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
we monitor and evaluate our exposure to credit losses and have established reserves based upon anticipated losses  general economic conditions and trends in the investment portfolio 
delinquencies as a percentage of all outstanding securitized mortgage loans decreased to at december  from at december  at december   management believes the level of credit reserves is appropriate for currently existing losses 
the following tables summarize single family mortgage loan and commercial mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding commercial securitized mortgage loans or single family balance for those securitizations in which we have retained a portion of the direct credit risk 
loans secured by low income housing tax credit lihtc properties account for of the company s securitized commercial loan portfolio 
section of the code provides tax credits to investors in projects to construct or substantially rehabilitate properties that provide housing for qualifying low income families 
failure to comply with certain income and rental restrictions required by section or default on a loan financing a section property during the compliance period can result in the recapture of previously received tax credits 
the potential cost of tax credit recapture provides an incentive to the property owner to support the property during the compliance period 
the following table shows the weighted average remaining compliance period of our portfolio of lihtc commercial loans at december  as a percent of the total lihtc commercial loan portfolio 
months remaining to end of compliance period as a percent of unpaid principal balance compliance period already exceeded zero through twelve months remaining thirteen through thirty six months remaining thirty seven through sixty months remaining for commercial mortgage loans  there were no delinquencies at december   down from percent of the outstanding securitized mortgage loans at december  the commercial loan that was delinquent in liquidated with a net loss of million during and had the greatest impact on the reduction of the overall delinquency rate 
the joint venture  in which we have a interest  currently has a single delinquent commercial mortgage loan  which is not included in this analysis below and has an unpaid principal balance of million 
commercial mortgage loan delinquency statistics december  to days delinquent to days delinquent days and over delinquent total includes foreclosures and real estate owned 
single family mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance decreased by to at december  from at december  serious delinquencies  defined as day delinquencies  declined from to 
our single family loan portfolio  which had an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million at december   was originated primarily between and and continues to perform and pay down as expected and with minimal losses 
approximately million of these loans are credit enhanced with mortgage pool insurance impacting realized losses 
during and  we incurred less than million of actual losses in each of those years 
single family loan delinquency statistics december  to days delinquent to days delinquent days and over delinquent total includes foreclosures and real estate owned

the following tables present the significant components of our interest income 
year ended december  amounts in thousands interest income securitized mortgage loans securities cash and cash equivalents other loans and investments the change in interest income on securitized mortgage loans and securities is examined in the discussion and tables that follow 
interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased million in compared to this increase is primarily the result of an million increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents outstanding during compared to interest income on other loans and investments decreased million to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the average balance of other loans and investments outstanding in compared to of million and million  respectively

year ended december  amounts in thousands interest income net amortization total interest income interest income net amortization total interest income securitized mortgage loans commercial single family total mortgage loans the majority of the decrease of million in interest income on commercial mortgage loans is primarily related to million of commercial mortgage loans that were derecognized in september those loans contributed million of interest income in and none in excluding the loans that were derecognized during  the average balance of the other commercial mortgage loans outstanding during declined by approximately million from the balance in interest income on securitized single family mortgage loans declined million to million for the year ended december  the decline in interest income on single family loans was primarily related to the decrease in the balance of the loans outstanding  which declined approximately million  or approximately  to million for the drop in the average balance of the loans was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on our single family loans  approximately of which were variable rate at december  net amortization for single family loans also decreased million to million for as a result of a slow down in the rate of prepayments on the loans as well as a reduction in the estimated future prepayment speeds 
interest income securities the following table presents the components of interest income on securities 
year ended december  amounts in thousands non agency rmbs agency rmbs corporate debt securities and other interest bearing securities the modest decline in interest income on securities is primarily related to the decline in the average balance of the interest earning securities as payments are received on those securities 
interest expense interest expense includes the interest paid and accrued on our financings as well as the amortization of any related discounts  premiums and deferred costs 
the following tables present the significant components of our interest expense

year ended december  amounts in thousands interest expense net amortization total interest expense interest expense net amortization total interest expense securitization financing commercial single family other bond related costs total mortgage loans interest expense on commercial securitization financing decreased from million for to million for the majority of this million decrease is related to the derecognition of million that were derecognized in september the securitization financing derecognized contributed approximately million of interest expense in and none in the weighted average balance outstanding of the remaining securitization financing decreased million  or approximately  from million in to million in and explains the majority of the remaining decrease 
the interest expense on single family securitization financing is related to a securitization bond that we redeemed in and reissued in the fourth quarter of the net amortization is related to the million discount at which the bond was reissued 
interest expense repurchase agreements the repurchase agreements partially finance the single family securitization bonds that we redeemed in one of those bonds was reissued during  as discussed above  and the related repurchase agreement financing was repaid 
we also elected to use some of our cash to significantly reduce the balance of the other repurchase agreement 
these actions combined with regular payments on the repurchase agreements reduced the weighted average balance of the repurchase agreements to million in compared to million in  which represents almost a reduction in the average balance of the financing 
this reduction in the balance financed was partially offset by a slight increase in the average yield on the financing from in to in interest expense obligation under payment agreement we entered into the obligation under payment agreement in september  so the year ended december  only reflected slightly more than three months of expense compared to a full twelve months for the year ended december  recapture of provision for loan losses we recaptured approximately million of reserves we had previously provided for estimated losses on our securitized mortgage loan portfolio 
the decrease in the estimated losses was primarily related to improvements in the performance of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio  which had no delinquent loans as of december  the performance of our single family mortgage loan portfolio also improved with the percentage of single family loans delinquent more than days declining from at december  to at december  equity in earnings loss of joint venture our interest in the operations of our joint venture changed from a loss of million to income of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the joint venture was formed in september  and the loss related to an impairment of a commercial mortgage backed security  which was larger than the income generated by the joint venture s other assets for the period 
in  the joint venture generated approximately million of net interest income  which was offset by a million valuation adjustment to a call right the joint venture has on certain bonds 
loss on capitalization of joint venture we recognized a loss of million in on the capitalization of a joint venture related to our contribution of our interest in a commercial loan securitization to the joint venture  and the creation of an obligation under payment agreement in connection with the formation of the joint venture 
the contribution of our interests in this securitization resulted in the derecognition of approximately million of commercial securitized mortgage loans and million of related securitization financing in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by million from million to million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased during primarily due to a reduction in salaries and benefits related to the closing of our tax lien servicing operation in pennsylvania 
we also had lower expenses in associated with legal services and corporate insurance costs

the following tables present the significant components of our interest income 
year ended december  amounts in thousands interest income securitized mortgage loans securities cash and cash equivalents other loans and investments interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased million in compared to this increase is primarily the result of a million increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents outstanding during compared to interest income on other loans and investments decreased million to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily related to our decision in to place our delinquent tax lien receivables on non accrual due to the uncertainty in the timing and quantity of the cash flows expected to be received on this investment  which had a balance of million and million at december  and  respectively

the interest expense on single family securitization financing was related to securitization financing bonds that we redeemed in and were not  therefore  outstanding during similarly  the interest expense on manufactured housing securitization financing was related to securitization financing bonds that were derecognized in when we sold our interest in the related securitization trusts 
interest expense repurchase agreements the repurchase agreements partially finance the single family securitization bonds that we redeemed in and two fixed rate securities which were purchased in and interest expense on the repurchase agreements increased by million as libor increased from at the beginning of to at the end of this increase in libor rates during and was partially offset by decreases in the financing balances 
weighted average repurchase agreement balances decreased from million in to million in interest expense obligation under payment agreement we entered into the obligation under payment agreement in september  so the year ended december  only reflected slightly more than months of expense with no expense in recapture of provision for loan losses the decline in the provision for loan losses from to was due primarily to an increase in reserves in for a large commercial loan that became delinquent in  whereas  there were no new significant delinquent commercial loans in equity in earnings loss of joint venture we entered a joint venture arrangement in september with two unrelated parties 
our interest in the operations of this joint venture ended its first year with a loss of million to income 
the loss related to an impairment of a commercial mortgage backed security  which was larger than the income generated by the joint venture s other assets for the period 
loss on capitalization of joint venture we recognized a loss of million for on the capitalization of a joint venture related to our contribution of a commercial loan securitization to the joint venture  and the creation of an obligation under payment agreement in connection with the formation of the joint venture 
the contribution of our interests in this securitization resulted in the derecognition of approximately million of securitized mortgage loans and million of related securitization financing

average balances and effective interest rates the following table summarizes the average balances of interest earning investment assets and their average effective yields  along with the average interest bearing liabilities and the related average effective interest rates  for each of the periods presented

average balances exclude funds held by trustees except defeased funds held by trustees 
effective rates are calculated excluding non interest related securitization financing expenses 
net yield on average interest earning assets reflects the annualized net interest income  excluding non interest related securitization financing expense  divided by the average interest earning assets for the period 
the value of increased from in primarily due to the derecognition of the commercial loan securitization in and the substantial repayment of repurchase agreements in compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  increased basis points to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest spread can be attributed primarily to the derecognition of million of securitized commercial mortgage loans and million of related securitization financing  the company s interests in which were contributed to a joint venture during the third quarter of the derecognized commercial mortgage loans and securitization financing had yields of and  respectively  during the time they were outstanding during excluding the derecognized assets and liabilities from the yield would have resulted in a net interest spread of approximately  which is comparable to that reported for the overall yield on interest earning assets  which exclude cash and cash equivalents  increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in primarily as a result of the derecognition of the securitized mortgage loans discussed above  which had an average yield of for the year ended december  and were responsible for approximately basis points of the increase 
the yield on our securitized single family mortgage loans increased basis points to for the year ended december  as the rates on the variable rate loans in the trust  which comprise approximately of the loans  reset higher during the year while the cost of the interest bearing liabilities declined 
compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  increased to basis points from basis points for the year ended december  this increase in the net interest spread is due to non recurring defeased interest and yield maintenance income on liquidated and delinquent commercial loans in in addition during  the increases in the average rate on the securitization financing  which were financing variable rate single family loans  slowed while interest rates on the loans reset higher during the year  which helped increase the net interest spread 
the overall yield on interest earning assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in primarily as a result of an increase of approximately basis points in the weighted average coupon on our securitized single family mortgage loans  the majority of which have an adjustable rate based on libor  and as a result of the derecognition of million in commercial mortgage loans contributed to a joint venture during the effective rate on interest bearing liabilities increased from to as a result of the overall increase in market interest rates 
approximately of our interest bearing liabilities reprice monthly and are indexed to one month libor  which averaged for  compared to for the effect of increasing market rates was muted by the derecognition of approximately million of non recourse securitization financing  which was financing a pool of commercial mortgage loans  our interests in which were contributed to a joint venture

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments or uncertainties  and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  or the application of which may have a material impact on our financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting policies 
consolidation of subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements represent our accounts after the elimination of inter company transactions 
we consolidate entities in which we own more than of the voting equity and control of the entity does not rest with others and variable interest entities in which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with fin r 
we follow the equity method of accounting for investments with greater than and less than a interest in partnerships and corporate joint ventures or when we are able to influence the financial and operating policies of the investee but own less than of the voting equity 
for all other investments  the cost method is applied 
securitization 
we have securitized loans and securities in a securitization financing transaction by transferring financial assets to a wholly owned trust  and the trust issues non recourse bonds pursuant to an indenture 
generally  we retain some form of control over the transferred assets  and or the trust is not deemed to be a qualified special purpose entity 
in instances where the trust is deemed not to be a qualified special purpose entity  the trust is included in our consolidated financial statements 
a transfer of financial assets in which we surrender control over those assets is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
for accounting and tax purposes  the loans and securities financed through the issuance of bonds in a securitization financing transaction are treated as our assets  and the associated bonds issued are treated as our debt as securitization financing 
we may retain certain of the bonds issued by the trust  and we generally will transfer collateral in excess of the bonds issued 
this excess is typically referred to as over collateralization 
each securitization trust generally provides us with the right to redeem  at our option  the remaining outstanding bonds prior to their maturity date 
impairments 
we evaluate all securities in our investment portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
a security is generally defined to be other than temporarily impaired if  for a maximum period of three consecutive quarters  the carrying value of such security exceeds its estimated fair value and we estimate  based on projected future cash flows or other fair value determinants  that the fair value will remain below the carrying value for the foreseeable future 
if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist  we record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the security down to its estimated fair value 
in certain instances  as a result of the other than temporary impairment analysis  the recognition or accrual of interest will be discontinued and the security will be placed on non accrual status 
we consider an investment to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its recorded cost basis 
impairments of other investments are generally considered to be other than temporary when the fair value remains below the carrying value for three consecutive quarters 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded in order to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated value 
allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for currently existing probable losses for loans in the company s investment portfolio that are considered impaired 
factors considered in establishing an allowance include current loan delinquencies  historical cure rates of delinquent loans  and historical and anticipated loss severity of the loans as they are liquidated 
the factors differ by loan type eg  single family versus commercial and collateral type eg  multifamily versus office 
the allowance for losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and estimated timing and amount of probable credit losses  using the above factors  as well as industry loss experience 
where loans are considered homogeneous  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a pool basis 
otherwise  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a loan specific basis 
provisions made to increase the allowance are charged as a current period expense 
single family loans are considered impaired when they are days past due 
commercial mortgage loans are evaluated on an individual basis for impairment 
commercial mortgage loans are secured by income producing real estate and are evaluated for impairment when the debt service coverage ratio on the loan is less than certain of the commercial mortgage loans are covered by loan guarantees that limit the company s exposure on these loans 
loans secured by low income housing tax credit properties account for of the company s securitized commercial loan portfolio 
section of the code provides tax credits to investors in projects to construct or substantially rehabilitate properties that provide housing for qualifying low income families 
failure to comply with certain income and rental restrictions required by section or default on a loan financing a section property during the compliance period can result in the recapture of previously received tax credits 
the potential cost of tax credit recapture provides an incentive to the property owner to support the property during the compliance period 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our investments and operations from a variety of sources  including a mix of collateral based short term financing sources such as repurchase agreements  collateral based long term financing sources such as securitization financing  equity capital  and net earnings 
our primary source of funding for our operations today is the cash flow generated from our existing investment portfolio assets  which includes net interest income and principal payments and prepayments on these investments 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to continue to service all of our outstanding recourse obligations  pay operating costs and fund dividends on our capital stock 
at december   we had cash and equivalents of million 
we anticipate that there will be a favorable investment climate in and beyond and therefore we anticipate utilizing our existing excess capital to fund additional investments 
assuming the availability of capital from more efficiently leveraging our asset base  before raising any additional capital from the issuance of common or preferred stock  we anticipate that we would have approximately million available to invest 
this amount includes million from the sale of certain equity investments in january we anticipate investing the majority of our million of investable capital in  principally in agency rmbs but also potentially in non agency rmbs and cmbs  all of which would be aaa rated  or near aaa rated 
if we deploy the majority of our capital and still believe there are attractive investments available  we anticipate raising additional equity capital if such capital could be raised at an attractive valuation 
in deploying new capital  we are likely to utilize repurchase agreement financing which will subject us to liquidity risk driven by fluctuations in market values of the collateral pledged to support the reverse repurchase agreement 
we will attempt to mitigate these risks by limiting the investments that we purchase to higher credit quality investments  and by managing certain aspects of the investments such as potential market value changes from changes in interest rates  as much as possible 
from the cash flow generated by our investment portfolio  we fund our operating overhead costs  pay the dividend on the series d preferred stock and service any outstanding debt 
our investment portfolio continues to provide positive cash flow  which can be utilized by us for reinvestment purposes 
we have primarily utilized our cash flow during to pay down repurchase agreement financing 
relative to others in our industry  our capital base is less leveraged  and we have much greater financial flexibility and resources 
management believes that our investment portfolio cash flows will be adequate over the next twelve months to fund our operating needs and to pay dividends 
during  we reissued a securitization bond that was initially issued in april and that had previously been redeemed in april we received proceeds of million on the sale 
in addition  the joint venture distributed million of its capital to its three members during  million of which was received by the company 
we believe that investment opportunities for our capital may be more readily available in the foreseeable future as disruptions in the fixed income markets  particularly in the residential mortgage market  has caused a decline in prices on most residential mortgage securities 
these disruptions have caused volatility in asset prices  causing such asset prices to decline  correspondingly increasing yields 
equity prices on companies which originate or invest in these securities have also declined 
as a result  we have evaluated several potential investment opportunities for residential mortgage securities  but to date  have not made meaningful investments of our capital 
the timing of any reinvestment will depend on the investment opportunity available and whether  in the opinion of management and the board of directors  such investment represents an acceptable risk adjusted return opportunity for the company s capital 
we currently utilize a combination of equity  securitization financing and repurchase agreement financing to finance our investment portfolio 
securitization financing represents bonds issued that are recourse only to the assets pledged as collateral to support the financing and are not otherwise recourse to us 
at december   we had million of non recourse securitization financing outstanding  most of which carries a fixed rate of interest 
the maturity of each class of securitization financing is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral and is not subject to margin call risk 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally on the earlier of a specified date or when the remaining balance of the bond equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
one series of bonds with a principal balance of million at december  and collateralized by commercial mortgage loans is redeemable at par on june  repurchase agreement financing is recourse to the assets pledged and to the resources of our company and requires us to post margin ie  collateral deposits in excess of the repurchase agreement financing 
the repurchase agreement counterparty at any time can request that we post additional margin or repay all financing balances 
repurchase agreement financing is not committed financing to the company  and it generally renews or rolls every days 
the amounts advanced to the company by the repurchase agreement counterparty are determined largely based on the fair value of the asset pledged to the counterparty  subject to its willingness to provide financing 
during  we paid off one of our repurchase agreements and paid down the other in order to reduce our leverage and as a result of the unfavorable renewal terms available due to market conditions 
during the fourth quarter  we paid down an additional million on the repurchase agreement and renewed the remaining balance for days at libor 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table shows expected cash payments on our contractual obligations as of december  for the following time periods amounts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations securitization financing repurchase agreements operating lease obligations mortgage servicing obligations obligation under payment agreement total as the master servicer for certain of the series of non recourse securitization financing securities which we have issued  and certain loans which have been securitized but for which we are not the master servicer  we have an obligation to advance scheduled principal and interest on delinquent loans in accordance with the underlying servicing agreements should the primary servicer fail to make such advance 
such advance amounts are generally repaid in the same month as they are made  or shortly thereafter  and the contractual obligation with respect to these advances is excluded from the above table 
amounts presented for long term debt obligations include estimated principal and interest on the related obligations 
securitization financing is non recourse to us as the bonds are payable solely from loans and securities pledged as securitized mortgage loans 
payments due by period were estimated based on the principal repayments forecast for the underlying loans and securities  substantially all of which is used to repay the associated securitization financing outstanding 
represents anticipated payments made by us to the subservicer of certain loans pledged to a securitization trust where we have an obligation to pay subservicing fees in excess of amounts paid by the trust 
we entered an agreement to contribute to a joint venture all of the net cash flows  including principal and interest  from our interests in a pool of securitized commercial mortgage loans 
by agreement  the joint venture is scheduled to dissolve no later than off balance sheet arrangements we do not believe that any off balance sheet arrangements exist that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
selected quarterly results the following tables present our unaudited selected quarterly results for and summary of selected quarterly results unaudited amounts in thousands except per share data year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter operating results total interest income net interest income after recapture of provision for loan losses net income basic and diluted net income per common share cash dividends declared per common share average interest earning assets average borrowed funds net interest spread on interest earning assets average asset yield net yield on average interest earning assets cost of funds year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter operating results total interest income net interest income after provision for loan losses net income loss basic and diluted net income loss per common share cash dividends declared per common share average interest earning assets average borrowed funds net interest spread on interest earning assets average asset yield net yield on average interest earning assets cost of funds computed as net interest margin excluding non interest non recourse securitization financing expenses divided by average interest earning assets 
the decrease in net income during the fourth quarter of relates primarily to losses incurred by a joint venture  which is accounted for under the equity method 
the loss was related to a million decrease in the fair value of an investment 
excludes cash and cash equivalents 
second quarter net interest spread increased compared to other quarters and cost of funds decreased due to amortization of asset discounts and bond premiums resulting from the prepayment of three commercial loans that constituted of outstanding upb 
forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k that are not historical fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act 
all statements contained in this annual report addressing the results of operations  our operating performance  events  or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to investment strategies  net interest income growth  earnings or earnings per share growth  and market share  as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based upon management s views and assumptions as of the date of this report  regarding future events and operating performance and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following reinvestment 
asset yields today are generally lower than those assets sold or repaid  due to lower overall interest rates and more competition for these assets as investment assets have repaid or been sold 
we have generally been unable to find investments which have acceptable risk adjusted yields 
as a result  our net interest income has been declining  and may continue to decline in the future  resulting in lower earnings per share over time 
in order to maintain our investment portfolio size and our earnings  we need to reinvest a portion of the cash flows we receive into new interest earning assets 
if we are unable to find suitable reinvestment opportunities  the net interest income on our investment portfolio and investment cash flows could be negatively impacted 
economic conditions 
we are affected by general economic conditions 
an increase in the risk of defaults and credit risk resulting from an economic slowdown or recession could result in a decrease in the value of our investments and the over collateralization associated with its securitization transactions 
as a result of our being heavily invested in short term high quality investments  a worsening economy  however  could also benefit us by creating opportunities for us to invest in assets that become distressed as a result of the worsening conditions 
these changes could have an effect on our financial performance and the performance on our securitized loan pools 
investment portfolio cash flow 
cash flows from the investment portfolio fund our operations  dividends  and repayments of outstanding debt  and are subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses  particularly given the high degree of internal structural leverage inherent in our securitized investments 
based on the performance of the underlying assets within the securitization structure  cash flows which may have otherwise been paid to us as a result of our ownership interest may be retained within the structure 
cash flows from the investment portfolio are likely to sequentially decline until we meaningfully begin to reinvest our capital 
there can be no assurances that we will find suitable investment alternatives for our capital  nor can there be assurances that we will meet our reinvestment and return hurdles 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact on our financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from our estimates or exceed reserves for losses recorded in the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severity may differ from our estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
in addition  commercial mortgage loans are generally large dollar balance loans  and a significant loan default may have an adverse impact on our financial results 
such impact may include higher provisions for loan losses and reduced interest income if the loan is placed on non accrual 
interest rate fluctuations 
our income and cash flow depends on our ability to earn greater interest on our investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by us generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
approximately million of our investments  including loans and securities currently pledged as securitized mortgage loans and securities  are fixed rate and approximately million of our investments are variable rate 
we currently finance these fixed rate assets through million of fixed rate securitization financing  million of variable rate securitization financing  and million of variable rate repurchase agreements 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest rate caps  the related borrowing has no delayed resets or such interest rate caps 
third party servicers 
our loans and loans underlying securities are serviced by third party service providers 
as with any external service provider  we are subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely services 
many borrowers require notices and reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and foreclosures 
a substantial increase in our delinquency rate that results from improper servicing or loan performance in general could harm our ability to securitize our real estate loans in the future and may have an adverse effect on our earnings 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
our exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yielding investments 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market in which we compete with a number of institutions with greater financial resources 
in purchasing portfolio investments and in issuing securities  we compete with other mortgage reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  commercial banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  federal agencies and other entities  many of which have greater financial resources and a lower cost of capital than we do 
increased competition in the market and our competitors greater financial resources have adversely affected us and may continue to do so 
competition may also continue to keep pressure on spreads resulting in us being unable to reinvest our capital on an acceptable risk adjusted basis 
regulatory changes 
our businesses as of and for the year ended december  were not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect us and the performance of our securitized loan pools or our ability to collect on our delinquent property tax receivables 
we are a reit and are required to meet certain tests in order to maintain our reit status as described in the earlier discussion of federal income tax considerations 
if we should fail to maintain our reit status  we would not be able to hold certain investments and would be subject to income taxes 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are required to comply with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the new york stock exchange 
failure to comply may result in doubt in the capital markets about the quality and adequacy of our internal controls and corporate governance 
this could result in our having difficulty in  or being unable to  raise additional capital in these markets in order to finance our operations and future investments 
other 
the following risks  which are discussed in more detail in item a risk factors above  could also affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows we may be unable to invest in new assets with attractive yields  and yields on new assets in which we do invest may not generate attractive returns  resulting in a decline in our earnings per share over time 
new investments may entail risks that we do not currently have in our investment portfolio or may substantially add risks to the investment portfolio which we may or may not have managed in the past as part of our investment strategy 
in addition  while we have owned agency rmbs in the past  we have never had a significant amount of our capital invested in these assets 
competition may prevent us from acquiring new investments at favorable yields potentially negatively impacting our profitability 
our ownership of certain subordinate interests in securitization trusts subjects us to credit risk on the underlying loans  and we provide for loss reserves on these loans as required under gaap 
our efforts to manage credit risk may not be successful in limiting delinquencies and defaults in underlying loans or losses on our investments 
certain investments employ internal structural leverage as a result of the securitization process  and are in the most subordinate position in the capital structure  which magnifies the potential impact of adverse events on our cash flows and reported results 
we may be subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely services from third party service providers  which may harm our results of operations 
prepayments of principal on our investments  and the timing of prepayments  may impact our reported earnings and our cash flows 
we may finance a portion of our investment portfolio with short term recourse repurchase agreements which may subject us to margin calls if the assets pledged subsequently decline in value 
interest rate fluctuations can have various negative effects on us  and could lead to reduced earnings and or increased earnings volatility 
hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings 
our reported income depends on accounting conventions and assumptions about the future that may change 
failure to qualify as a reit would adversely affect our dividend distributions and could adversely affect the value of our securities 
maintaining reit status may reduce our flexibility to manage our operations 
we may fail to properly conduct our operations so as to avoid falling under the definition of an investment company pursuant to the investment company act of we are dependent on certain key personnel 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas applies to reporting periods beginning after november  the company does not expected the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and all interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is permitted provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued interim or annual financial statements for that fiscal year 
the company does not expected the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations and to initially measure those servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value  if practicable 
the company elected the option to measure its servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded in its earnings 
the company s adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations which revised sfas no 
 business combinations 
this pronouncement is effective as of january  under sfas  organizations utilized the announcement date as the measurement date for the purchase price of the acquired entity 
sfas r requires measurement at the date the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree  generally referred to as the acquisition date 
sfas r will have a significant impact on the accounting for transaction costs  restructuring costs as well as the initial recognition of contingent assets and liabilities assumed during a business combination 
under sfas r  adjustments to the acquired entity s deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position balances occurring outside the measurement period are recorded as a component of the income tax expense  rather than goodwill 
as the provisions of sfas r are applied prospectively  the impact cannot be determined until the transactions occur 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas r may have on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of our market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a specialty finance company  net interest income comprises the primary component of our earnings and cash flows 
we are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of our interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or re price within specified periods 
we monitor the aggregate cash flow  projected net interest income and estimated market value of our investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
we specifically focus on the sensitivity of our investment portfolio cash flow  primarily the cash flow generated from the net interest income of our investment portfolio  and measure such sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
because cash and cash equivalents are such a large portion of our overall assets  we also calculate the sensitivity of our cash flows including cash and cash equivalents as if they are part of our investment portfolio 
for both analyses  we estimate our net interest income cash flow for the next twenty four months assuming interest rates over such time period follow the forward libor curve based on day eurodollar futures contracts as of december   which we refer to as the base case 
once the base case has been estimated  net interest income cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to cash flow 
to the extent we have any cash flow changes from interest rate swaps  caps  floors or any other derivative instrument  they are included in this analysis 
the following table summarizes our net interest income cash flow and sensitivity analyses as of december  under the assumptions set forth above 
these analyses represent management s estimate of the change in net interest income cash flow expressed in dollar terms and as a percentage of the base case for the investment portfolio only and the investment portfolio inclusive of cash and cash equivalents  given a parallel shift in interest rates as discussed above 
as noted above  the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at december   both one month libor and six month libor was 
the analysis below is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates beyond the forward libor curve  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of our assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain investments which we own provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting our portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to our portfolio  and no change to our liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in our investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by us 
as a result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio  there are likely to be such changes in the future 
investment portfolio investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents amounts in thousands basis point change in interest rates cash flow percent cash flow percent base case as noted in the table above  net interest income cashflow from our investment portfolio is generally largely insulated from shifts in interest rates due principally to the fact that we have match funded a large percentage of our investments 
approximately million of our investment portfolio is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
approximately million of our investment portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately million of our liabilities are fixed rate and approximately million are floating rate liabilities  which reset monthly based on one month libor 
approximately  and of the adjustable rate loans underlying our securitized mortgage loans are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor  one year constant maturity treasury rate and prime rate  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  our net interest income earned and the corresponding cash flow on our investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i fixed rate loans and investments financed with variable rate debt  ii the lag in resets of the adjustable rate loans relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings  and iii rate resets on the adjustable rate loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as to item i  we have substantially limited our interest rate risk by match funding fixed rate assets and variable rate assets 
as to items ii and iii  as short term interest rates stabilize and the adjustable rate loans reset  the net interest margin may be partially restored as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to market conditions 
net interest income may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the adjustable rate loans generally reset less frequently than floating rate liabilities and are limited as to how much they actually reset 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that we have entered into such agreements
