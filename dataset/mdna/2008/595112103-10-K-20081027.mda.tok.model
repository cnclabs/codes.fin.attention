this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended august  all period references are to the company s fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated 
the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the thursday closest to august all tabular dollar amounts are in millions 
all production data reflects production of the company and its consolidated joint ventures 
overview the company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices  principally semiconductor memory products including dram and nand flash and cmos image sensors 
the company operates in two segments memory and imaging 
its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers  workstations  network servers  mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards  usb storage devices  digital still cameras  mp players and in automotive applications 
the company markets its products through its internal sales force  independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world 
the company s success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified portfolio of semiconductor memory products  efficient utilization of the company s manufacturing infrastructure  successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development investments 
in and the semiconductor memory industry experienced a severe downturn due to a significant oversupply of products 
average selling prices per gigabit for the company s dram products and nand flash products in were down approximately and  respectively  as compared to and down approximately and  respectively  as compared to as a result of these market conditions  the company and other semiconductor memory manufacturers have reported negative gross margins and substantial losses in recent periods 
in  the company reported a net loss billion and many of its competitors reported negative cash flows from operations 
in response to these market conditions  on october  the company announced a plan to restructure its memory operations 
the company s im flash joint venture with intel corporation will discontinue production of mm wafer nand flash memory at micron s boise facility 
the nand flash production shutdown will reduce im flash s nand flash production by approximately  mm wafers per month 
in addition  the company and intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of nand flash production at im flash s singapore wafer fabrication plant 
as part of the restructuring  the company plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately percent during and cash costs for restructuring and other related expenses incurred in connection with this restructuring are anticipated to be approximately million  and the benefit to the company s cash operating results for is expected to exceed million 
the effects of the worsening global economy and the tightening credit market are also making it increasingly difficult for semiconductor memory manufacturers to obtain external sources of financing to fund their operations 
although the company believes that it is better positioned than some of its peers  it faces challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness 
additionally  the company is pursuing financing alternatives  delaying capital expenditures and implementing further cost cutting initiatives 
the company is focused on improving its competitiveness by developing new products  advancing its technology and reducing costs 
in addition  the company increased its manufacturing capacity in and by ramping nand flash production at two mm wafer fabrication facilities and converting another facility to mm dram wafer fabrication 
to reduce costs  the company implemented restructure initiatives aimed at reducing manufacturing and overhead costs through outsourcing  relocation of operations and workforce reductions 
the company makes significant ongoing investments to develop proprietary product and process technology that is implemented in its worldwide manufacturing facilities and through its joint ventures to enable the production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs 
the company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as its leading edge line width process technology and innovative array architecture 
the company continues to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics  such as higher data transfer rates  reduced package size  lower power consumption and increased memory density and megapixel count 
to leverage its significant investments in research and development  the company has formed strategic joint ventures under which the costs of developing memory product and process technologies are shared with its joint venture partners 
in addition  from time to time  the company has also sold and or licensed technology to third parties 
the company is pursuing further opportunities to recover its investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements 
dram joint ventures with nanya technology corporation nanya in the third quarter of  the company and nanya formed meiya  a joint venture to manufacture stack dram and sell those products exclusively to the company and nanya 
as part of this transaction  the company transferred and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of stack dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya 
the company and nanya also agreed to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products with each party bearing its own development costs until such time that the development costs exceed a specified amount  following which such costs would be shared 
the company s development costs are expected to exceed nanya s development costs by a significant amount 
under this arrangement  the company is to receive an aggregate of million from nanya and meiya through for licensing and technology transfer fees  of which the company realized million of revenue in the company will also receive royalties from nanya on the sale of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya 
on october   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire qimonda ag s ownership stake in inotera memories  inc inotera  a taiwanese dram memory manufacturer  for million in cash 
the company received commitments for million of term loans to fund this acquisition in part 
inotera is expected to implement the company s stack dram process technology  and it is anticipated that the company will receive royalties on the sale of inotera s production that is delivered to nanya  a stakeholder in inotera 
the company will eventually gain access to approximately  mm dram wafers per month  of inotera s output 
in connection with this acquisition  the company expects to enter into a series of agreements with nanya to restructure meiya 
it is anticipated that both parties will cease future resource commitments to meiya and redirect those resources to inotera
