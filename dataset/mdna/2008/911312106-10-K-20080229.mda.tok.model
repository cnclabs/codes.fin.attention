next day air volume increased and ground volume increased for the year  largely as a result of a solid peak season in the fourth quarter  when our next day air volume rose and ground volume increased 
deferred air volume declined in our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing us economy and weak small package market in trends in us industrial production and business to consumer shipments in have not been favorable to the overall small package market  which places pressure on our domestic package volume 
the increase in overall revenue per piece of in resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year  but was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix 
next day air revenue per piece declined  and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our lower yielding next day air saver products 
deferred revenue per piece increased only 
the change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate discussed further below 
ground revenue per piece increased  primarily due to the rate increase  but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in compared with overall product mix reduced revenue per piece  as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground volume grew 
consistent with the practice in previous years  a rate increase took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
other pricing changes included a increase in the residential surcharge  and a increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts 
in january  we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 
this fuel surcharge continues to be based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was in  a decline from the in  primarily due to the reduction in the index 
the ground fuel surcharge rate continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was in  an increase from in  due to higher diesel fuel prices 
as a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements  total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by million in us domestic package incurred an operating loss of billion in  compared with a billion operating profit in  largely due to a billion charge related to our withdrawal from the central states  southeast and southwest areas pension fund central states pension fund 
additionally  domestic package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue growth  an aircraft impairment charge  and a special voluntary separation opportunity svso charge 
the aircraft impairment and svso charges reduced domestic operating profit by million and million  respectively 
these factors were partially offset by cost controls  including  among other categories  lower self insurance expense 
the expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims  automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors 
the central states pension fund withdrawal  aircraft impairment  and svso charges  as well as the impact of lower self insurance expense  are discussed further in the operating expenses section 
compared to us domestic package revenue increased billion  or  for the year  with average daily package volume up 
volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid us economy  strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume 
overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of compared with  due to slower overall economic growth in the us and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter 
pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up for the year 
ground revenue per piece increased and next day air revenue per piece increased for the year  primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in compared to deferred revenue per piece increased for the year for the same reasons  but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight  lower revenue packages 
on january   a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years rate increases 
we increased rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our delivery required and signature confirmation services 
the residential surcharge increased for ups ground services and for ups next day air  ups nd day air and ups day select 
in january  we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 
the air fuel surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of through june  effective june   we reduced the index by another and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge 
this fuel surcharge continued to be based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was in  as compared with in additionally  the ups ground fuel surcharge continued to fluctuate based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was in  as compared to in total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by million in  due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices  volume growth  and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above 
these fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices  as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices 
us domestic package operating profit increased million  or  for the year  and the operating margin increased by approximately basis points to 
this increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously  combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks 
the operating profit for our us domestic package segment was negatively impacted by the settlement of a class action litigation see contingencies section below  which resulted in an million charge to expense 
operating profit for this segment was positively affected as a result of lower expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims  automotive liability and general business liabilities in compared with international package operations compared to international package revenue improved billion  or in  driven by a volume increase for our export products and an increase in total revenue per piece 
the growth in revenue per piece was positively impacted by base rate increases and the weakening of the us dollar against several major foreign currencies in  but was adversely affected by a lower fuel surcharge rate applied to our us origin international air products 
export volume increased throughout the world 
asian export volume grew strongly in key markets during the year  especially china 
asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion  as well as strong economic growth  which benefits our intra asian package business 
to continue this expansion  we received authority in to operate six daily flights between the us and nagoya  japan 
we are also constructing a package and freight air hub in shanghai  china that is expected to open in this hub will link shanghai to our international air network  with direct service to europe  asia  and the americas 
european export volume also grew solidly  largely due to continued growth in the transborder business and improved economic and industrial output in the european union 
us export volume increased at a slower pace 
non us domestic volume increased for the year  and was impacted by growth in several major european countries and canada 
export revenue per piece increased for the year  largely due to rate increases and favorable exchange rates  but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products  and a reduction in certain fuel surcharge rates 
non us domestic revenue per piece increased for the year  and was affected by rate increases and favorable exchange rates 
total average revenue per piece increased on a currency adjusted basis  and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by million in due to currency fluctuations  net of hedging activity 
in january  we increased rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service 
rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year 
also in january  we modified the fuel surcharge on certain us related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 
the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions 
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by million during the year due to increased volume  but was partially offset by the reduction in the fuel surcharge index 
international package operating profit increased million  or  for the year  primarily due to the volume and revenue per piece improvements described above 
the change in operating profit was also positively affected by million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates  net of hedging activity 
international package operating profit was adversely affected in by charges related to the aircraft impairment million and the svso million  both of which are discussed further in the operating expenses section 
operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel  as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense 
the adverse impact of the aircraft impairment  svso charge  and fuel were the primary causes of the basis point decline in operating margin to 
compared to international package revenue improved billion  or  for the year  primarily due to the volume growth for our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix  as lower yielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall international volume 
the change in revenue was positively affected by million during the year due to currency fluctuations  net of hedging activity 
revenue increased by million during the year due to business acquisitions completed previously 
in january  we increased rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service

the air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of through june  effective june   we reduced the index by another and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge 
the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions  depending upon where the shipment took place 
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume 
export volume increased throughout the world  with solid volume increases in europe  asia  and us export products 
asian export volume continued to benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in asia  while european export volume gains were impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the european union 
international domestic volume increased for the year  due to volume growth in canada and europe  which also benefited from the acquisition of stolica in poland during the second quarter of and the acquisition of lynx in the uk during the third quarter of excluding the impact of acquisitions  international domestic volume and revenue increased and  respectively  for the year 
export revenue per piece increased for the year  largely due to the rate increases discussed previously  the impact of the fuel surcharge  and currency fluctuations  partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products 
for the year  total international average daily package volume increased  while average revenue per piece decreased decreased currency adjusted 
the improvement in operating profit for our international package segment was million for the year  or  and the operating margin increased basis points to 
the increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth described previously 
the change in operating profit was also positively affected by million during the year due to currency fluctuations 
supply chain freight operations compared to supply chain freight revenue increased million  or  in forwarding and logistics revenue increased million  or  for the year  and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements and revenue management initiatives begun in favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by million during the year 
revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight and mail services  which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates 
ups freight increased revenue million  or  for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume 
average ltl shipments per day increased during the year  driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package customer base for new sales opportunities 
ltl revenue per hundredweight increased during the year  due to an increase in base rates in and a focus on higher yielding customer segments 
the increase in revenue per hundredweight and average daily shipments were somewhat offset by a decrease for the year in the ltl weight per shipment 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business  our financial business  and our us domestic cargo operations  increased revenue by during the year 
this revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 
operating profit for the supply chain freight segment was million in  compared with a profit of million in  resulting in a basis point improvement in the operating margin 
this improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business as a result of cost controls  a focus on asset utilization  and revenue management initiatives 
cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in  which included a reduction of non operating staff of approximately  people 
additionally  margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business  through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft 
finally  revenue management initiatives put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts  and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets 
operating profit in for this segment was reduced by million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non core business units in france  as well as by million due to the svso charge 
these charges are discussed further in the operating expenses section 
currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by million in compared to supply chain freight revenue increased billion  or  for the year 
ups freight  formerly known as overnite corp  provided billion of the increase in revenue for the year 
excluding the impact of the overnite acquisition in august  segment revenues grew for the year 
total average daily ltl shipments for ups freight in declined against the full year both the pre and post acquisition period due to service issues caused by the integration of the ups freight business  as well as a weakening in the overall ltl market in the united states in the latter half of ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments 
forwarding and logistics revenue increased million  or for the year  largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit 
the forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on ups  including increased utilization of ups owned assets 
this has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense 
the increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives  which involved reducing less profitable accounts 
in addition  revenue increased by million during the year due to currency fluctuations 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business and our financial business  increased revenue by during the year 
this revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue  as well as revenue earned from our previously announced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the us postal service 
for the year  the supply chain freight segment reported million in operating profit  as compared with a million in operating profit for these results were impacted by the integration of the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding business into our air network  and the integration of the motor cargo business unit within the acquired overnite corp 
operations into the ups freight network 
the ups freight integration led to service issues  which resulted in a loss of revenue  as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs 
the integration of the menlo worldwide forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover 
the increase in operating profit was positively affected by million during due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense 
in an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth  we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of this restructuring plan was designed to generate efficiencies  resulting in improved operating profits  by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers 
this restructuring involved the reduction of non operating expenses by approximately  including a reduction in non operating staff of approximately  people 
we incurred million in expenses in related to employee severance 
operating expenses compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  in compared with currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by million for the year 
compensation and benefits expense increased by billion for the year  and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the central states pension fund  higher wage rates in the union workforce  increased stock based compensation  higher expense for union pension and welfare programs  the svso charge  and the restructuring charge in our supply chain freight business in france 
these increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense 
our national master agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters allowed us  upon ratification  to withdraw employees from the central states pension fund and to establish a jointly trusteed single employer plan for this group 
upon ratification of the contract in december and our withdrawal from the central states pension fund  we recorded a pre tax billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability  and made a december payment in the same amount to the central states pension fund to satisfy this liability 
in december  we offered a special voluntary separation opportunity svso to approximately employees who work in non operating functions 
this program was established to improve the efficiency of non operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company 
the svso ended in february  and  or of eligible employees  accepted the offer 
as a result  we recorded a charge to expense of approximately million in the first quarter of  to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the svso program 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in france 
the objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the europe region 
the restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program  which was ratified by our company s trade union representatives in france in july employees participating in this program are entitled to severance benefits  including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase 
these severance benefits are formula driven and are in accordance with french statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million million related to severance costs  and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense in related to this program 
stock based and other management incentive compensation expense increased million  or  during  primarily due to awards of stock options  restricted performance units  and restricted stock units 
pension and healthcare expense increased during the year  largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees  but was somewhat offset by lower expense for the ups sponsored pension benefits see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we modified our management incentive awards program under our incentive compensation plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units  with certain exceptions for first time participants in the program 
the restricted stock units granted each year under this program generally have a five year graded vesting period  with approximately of the total restricted stock unit award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant 
the other half of the management incentive award granted each year is in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of class a common stock and is fully vested at the time of grant 
previous awards under the management incentive awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recognize the expense associated with restricted stock unit awards over the appropriate vesting period 
we anticipate that this change in the award structure will have the effect of increasing the expense recognized for our restricted stock unit grants in future years  until approximately  when we the effect of expensing new restricted stock unit grants will be somewhat offset with the elimination of expense from awards that have become completely vested 
the expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims  automotive liability and general business liabilities was million lower in compared with insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
the lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors  including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies  improved oversight and management of claims  improved trends in health care costs  and favorable state legislative reforms 
the increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft  largely offset by lower maintenance expense on vehicles and buildings 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors  including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software  partially offset by increased depreciation expense on vehicles 
the increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our international package business and currency fluctuations  as well as growth in our international forwarding business 
the increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel  as well as higher usage  but was partially mitigated by hedging gains 
other occupancy expense increased for the year  and was affected by increased rent expense and property taxes  but partially offset by lower utilities expense 
the increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a million aircraft impairment charge  discussed further below  but partially offset with cost controls in several areas 
the comparison in other expenses was also affected by the million charge in the cornn class action litigation in see contingencies section 
as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of  including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates  we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses 
the review was completed in march  and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing and aircraft  and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in this charge is included in the caption other expenses in the statement of consolidated income  of which million impacted our us domestic package segment and million impacted our international package segment 
compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of overnite  stolica  and lynx 
currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by million for the year 
compensation and benefits increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above  as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense 
these increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense  as previously discussed 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  compensation and benefits expense increased for the year 
stock based and other management incentive compensation expense increased million  or in  due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of  the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of  and the impact of adopting the non substantive vesting period approach of fas r discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our management incentive awards program in other operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above  as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation 
the table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in on the increase in operating expenses by category in total increase acquisition impact increase without acquisitions other operating expenses repairs and maintenance depreciation and amortization purchased transportation fuel other occupancy other expenses excluding the effect of acquisitions  the increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet a  diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage  but was partially mitigated by hedging gains 
the increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our international package business  currency fluctuations  higher fuel prices  increased rail costs  and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously 
the increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment  aircraft and engines  and higher amortization expense on intangible assets 
the increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses 
the increase in other expenses was impacted by several items  including the million tentative settlement of a class action litigation see contingencies section below 
investment income and interest expense compared to the increase in investment income of million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments  but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest earning investments and increased equity method losses on investment partnerships 
interest expense increased million in  primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding  largely related to commercial paper 
our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of  causing a corresponding increase in interest expense  as a result of the payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund 
increased interest charges were somewhat offset  however  by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects  including aircraft purchases and our worldport expansion 
compared to the decrease in investment income of million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments  due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings  business acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
this was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments  as well as the absence of any investment impairments during million of investment impairments were recognized in  as described below 
the million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps  as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships 
this was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during  as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year 
net income and earnings per share compared to net income for was million  an decrease from the billion achieved in  resulting in an decrease in diluted earnings per share to in from in this decrease in net income was largely due to the after tax billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the central states pension fund 
additionally  net income was adversely impacted by million as a result of the restructuring charge in our france supply chain freight business  million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge  and million as a result of the svso charge 
these items were partially offset by the improved results in our international package and supply chain freight segments 
the reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal  aircraft impairment  france restructuring  and svso charges noted above 
these items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by and in basic and diluted earnings per share benefited from a reduction in outstanding shares in compared with  due to our ongoing share repurchase program 
compared to net income for was billion  an increase from the billion achieved in  resulting in a increase in diluted earnings per share to in from in net income in benefited from a million reduction in income tax expense impact to diluted earnings per share due to favorable developments with certain us federal tax contingency matters involving non us operations 
diluted earnings per share has increased at a faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program 
the increase in net income for was largely due to higher operating profits for both our us domestic and international package segments 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and billion in   and  respectively 
the decrease in operating cash flows compared with and was primarily due to the billion payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund in this was partially offset by reduced fundings to our management pension and postretirement benefit plans 
in  we funded million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to billion in and million in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in are projected to be approximately million 
the amount of us federal estimated income tax payments was lower in compared with and  due to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment for income tax purposes 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we received an million us federal tax refund due to overpayments of our estimated tax liability 
in  we received a million tax refund associated with the settlement with the internal revenue service irs reached previously  primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance 
additionally  we paid approximately million in to employees who accepted the svso offer  and we expect to pay approximately million in the first quarter of related to this program 
on november   we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on december  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
we also increased the base rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service 
other pricing changes included a increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase of in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 
these rate changes are customary  and are consistent with previous years rate increases 
additionally  we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and us origin international air services by reducing by the index used to determine the fuel surcharge 
the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 
in january  ups freight announced a general rate increase averaging percent covering non contractual shipments in the united states and canada 
the increase goes into effect on february   and applies to minimum charge  ltl and tl rates 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was billion  billion  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in compared with was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and increased net sales of marketable securities and short term investments 
net sales of marketable securities and short term investments were million  million  and billion in   and  respectively  and were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans  as well as complete business acquisitions 
in  we spent billion on business acquisitions  primarily overnite corp  lynx express ltd 
in the united kingdom  messenger service stolica sa in poland  and the express operations of sinotrans air transportation development co 
ltd 
in china see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we had a net cash use of million in  compared with cash generation of and million in and  respectively  due to originations  sales  and customer paydowns of finance receivables  primarily in our commercial lending  asset based lending  and leasing portfolios 
in the second quarter of  we terminated several energy derivatives and received million in cash  which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows 
these derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products 
as these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting  we recognized the gains associated with these hedges as a reduction of fuel expense over the original term of the hedges through capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities  as follows in millions buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology as described in the commitments section below  we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft  vehicles  equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 
financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was   and billion in   and  respectively 
as of december   we increased our commercial paper borrowings to billion  an increase of billion over december  this issuance of commercial paper was used to fund the withdrawal payment to the central states pension fund upon ratification of our labor contract with the teamsters  as previously discussed 
the commercial paper balance was reduced subsequent to december  as a result of an issuance of long term debt discussed further in the sources of credit section and the receipt of an income tax refund 
issuances of debt during consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper and ups notes 
repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equity method partnerships 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock  pay dividends  and repay long term debt 
in october  the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to billion  which replaced the remaining amount available under our february share repurchase authorization 
for the years ended december   and  we repurchased a total of   and million shares of class a and class b common stock for   and billion  respectively   and billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements 
in january  we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value 
prospectively  we intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately funds from operations to total debt 
to implement this policy  the board of directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to billion 
we intend to complete this level of share repurchases within two years 
share repurchases may take the form of an accelerated share repurchase program  open market purchases  or other such methods as we deem appropriate 
we increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to per share in from per share in  resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to billion from billion 
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
on january   our board declared a dividend of per share  which is payable on march  to shareowners of record on february  the board also approved an earlier payment schedule for the dividend typically declared in november 
beginning in and going forward  that dividend is expected to be paid in december instead of the following january 
the movement of the fourth quarter dividend payment into december will result in a total of five dividend payments being made in sources of credit we are authorized to borrow up to billion under our us commercial paper program 
we had billion outstanding under this program as of december   with an average interest rate of 
at december   we classified billion of our commercial paper as long term debt on our balance sheet  due to the subsequent refunding of the commercial paper through the issuance of long term debt  as discussed further below 
we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in a variety of currencies  however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december  in november  we filed a shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states 
on january   we completed an offering of billion of senior notes due january  million of senior notes due january  and billion of senior notes due january all of these notes pay interest semiannually  and allow for redemption of the notes by ups at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a make whole amount  plus accrued interest 
after pricing and underwriting discounts  we received a total of billion in cash proceeds from the offering 
the proceeds from the offering were used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance 
we maintain three credit agreements with a consortium of banks  two of which provide revolving credit facilities of billion each  with one expiring april  and the other april   and the third providing a revolving credit facility of billion and expiring on october  interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 
our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants 
covenants in our credit facilities generally require us to maintain a billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the company 
the notes issued in january include limitations on secured indebtedness and on sale leaseback transactions 
these covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company  and all applicable covenant tests were satisfied as of december  commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases  operating leases  debt obligations  purchase commitments  and certain other liabilities 
we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations 
the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions year capital leases operating leases debt principal debt interest purchase commitments pension fundings other liabilities after total our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft 
capital leases  operating leases  and purchase commitments  as well as our debt principal obligations  are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt  in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december  the calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
the maturities of debt principal and interest include the effect of the january issuance of billion in senior notes that were used to reduce the commercial paper balance 
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  the largest of which are orders for aircraft  engines  and parts 
in february  we announced an order for boeing er freighters to be delivered between and we also have firm commitments to purchase nine boeing f aircraft scheduled for delivery between and  and two boeing bcf aircraft scheduled for delivery during these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
in july  we formally cancelled our previous order for ten airbus a freighter aircraft  pursuant to the provisions of an agreement signed with airbus in february as a result of our cancellation of the airbus a order  we received cash in july representing the return of amounts previously paid to airbus as purchase contract deposits and accrued interest on those balances 
additionally  we received a credit memorandum to be used by ups for the purchase of parts and services from airbus 
the cancellation of the airbus order did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the ups ibt pension plan  which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters 
the ups ibt pension plan is the only ups sponsored pension or postretirement benefit plan with a material minimum funding requirement as of december  the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of and the employee retirement income security act of  using discount rates  asset returns  and other assumptions appropriate for this plan 
to the extent that the funded status of the ups ibt pension plan in future years differs from our current projections  the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 
the contractual payments due under the other liabilities column primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships 
the table above does not include approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash 
in addition  although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with fin  we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities 
fin is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately billion issued in connection with routine business requirements 
as of december   we had unfunded loan commitments totaling million associated with our financial business 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures  such as commitments for aircraft purchases  for the foreseeable future 
contingencies we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws 
in one of these cases  marlo v 
ups  which has been certified as a class action in a california federal court  plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime  and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods  and interest and attorneys fees 
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of  full time supervisors 
in august  the court granted summary judgment in favor of ups on all claims  and plaintiff appealed the ruling 
in october  the appeals court reversed the lower court s ruling 
we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in another case  cornn v 
ups  which was certified as a class action in a california federal court  plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and or overtime and meal and rest periods 
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately  drivers and seek back wages  penalties  interest and attorneys fees 
ups settled this matter in full for a total payment of million in the second quarter of the settlement had no impact on our operating results as it was accrued for previously during the third quarter of in another case  hohider v 
ups  which in july was certified as a class action in a pennsylvania federal court  plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the company s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the americans with disabilities act 
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over  current and former employees  and seek backpay  compensatory and punitive damages  as well as attorneys fees 
in august  the third circuit court of appeals granted the company s petition to hear the appeal of the trial court s recent certification order 
the appeal will likely take one year 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
ups and mail boxes etc  inc are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate mail boxes etc 
centers and the ups store locations 
these lawsuits relate to the re branding of mail boxes etc 
centers to the ups store  the the ups store business model  the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of the ups store franchises  and ups s sale of services in the franchisees territories 
we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
ups and ups freight  along with several other companies involved in the ltl freight business  have been named as defendants in numerous putative class action lawsuits filed since july  in courts across the nation 
the cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multi district litigation proceeding in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia 
the lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates  and they seek injunctive relief  treble damages and attorneys fees 
we intend to defend against these suits vigorously 
these cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
along with an income tax audit for years and  the internal revenue service irs is currently examining non income based taxes including excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases  which could lead to proposed assessments 
the irs has not presented an official position with regard to excise taxes at this time  and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment  however  we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters 
in september  we reached a new national master agreement with the teamsters  which was ratified in december the new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans  and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement will take effect on august   with the exception of our withdrawal from the central states pension fund  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have approximately  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association  which becomes amendable at the end of our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which became amendable on november  we began formal negotiations with teamsters local on october  in addition  the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers approximately 
these agreements run through july  apart from the central states pension fund  we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans  including unfavorable investment performance  changes in demographics  and increased benefits to participants 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions  if any  or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 
other matters we received grand jury subpoenas from the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj regarding the doj s investigations into air cargo pricing practices in july and into freight forwarding pricing practices in december in october  we received information requests from the european commission and the new zealand commerce commission relating to investigations of freight forwarding pricing practices 
we are cooperating with these investigations 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline 
currently  the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes 
additionally  we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices 
the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
in the second quarter of  we terminated several energy derivatives and received million in cash 
these derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products 
as these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting  the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through the end of foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities  as well as cash equivalent instruments  some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest 
the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december  and would be immaterial 
this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk  and for certain of these securities  we utilize options to hedge this price risk 
at december  and  the fair value of such investments was and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of such investments  assuming a change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately and million at december  and credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
fair value measurements fas  which was issued to define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of fas for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities  and removed certain leasing transactions from its scope 
we adopted fas on january   and the impact of adoption was not material to our results of operations or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fas 
this statement requires us to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet  and required delayed recognition items  consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits  to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement 
on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fas  which resulted in a reduction to aoci of billion and a reduction of long term deferred tax liabilities of billion 
additionally  we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under statement no 
employers accounting for pensions  and we measure the funded status of our plans as of september each year 
under the provisions of fas  we will be required to use a december measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in as a result of this change in measurement date  we recorded a cumulative effect after tax million reduction to retained earnings as of january  in february  the fasb issued statement no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas  which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie  the fair value option  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates  such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
additionally  sfas no 
allows for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings 
we adopted fas on january   and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method 
accordingly  we recorded an after tax million reduction to retained earnings as of january   representing the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting fas in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fin  and the impact of this interpretation is discussed in note in june  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards 
eitf requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units  which are expected to vest  be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
eitf is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december   and we will adopt the provisions of eitf beginning in the first quarter of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december the fasb issued statement no 
r business combinations fas r 
fas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
fas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the impact of fas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
fas 
fas requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling minority interests as equity as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests 
as of december   we had approximately million in noncontrolling interests classified in other non current liabilities 
fas applies prospectively as of january   except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to the company s financial position as of december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units 
goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
we use a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the fair value of our goodwill 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
as of december   our recorded goodwill was billion  of which billion relates to our supply chain and freight segment 
this segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years  largely due to the acquisitions that we have made 
because of its growth  this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies  resulting in higher volatility in our dcf model projections than for our other segments 
our annual impairment tests performed in  and resulted in no goodwill impairment 
self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
pension and postretirement medical benefits as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
a basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company s costs and obligations for the year in millions basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation financial instruments as discussed in notes    and to our consolidated financial statements  and in the market risk section of this report  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads  and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange  and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report 
depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of  including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates  we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses 
the review was completed in march  and based on the results of our evaluation  we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing and aircraft  and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in this charge is included in the caption other expenses in the statement of consolidated income  of which million impacted our us domestic package segment and million impacted our international package segment 
during  we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our boeing  boeing  and airbus a fleets  and as a result of this evaluation  increased the depreciable lives from to years and reduced the residual values from to of original cost 
this change did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction  tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
in the first quarter of  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance see note in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision
