item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company has market risk related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not generally use derivative financial instruments in connection with these market risks  except as noted below 
interest rates the company s most significant long term debt instrument is the domestic revolving credit facility  which bears interest at variable rates based on libor 
the company has entered into the following interest rate swaps date initial amount fixed interest rate interest rate spread at september  equal quarterly payments maturity date april million million april september million million april august million april august million april september million september may million september the interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the future variable interest payments under the revolving credit facility which are considered probable of occurring 
based on the company s assessment  all the critical terms of each of the hedges matched the underlying terms of the hedged debt and related forecasted interest payments  and as such  these hedges were considered highly effective 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps reflected an unrealized loss of million  after tax at september  that is included in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income 
a decrease of in market interest rates ie a decrease from to would result in an increase of approximately  in the fair value liability of the interest rate swaps 
commodity price risks in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to commodity price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies such as bronze ingot  steel  fuel and wood used in its manufacturing operations 
the company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available 
foreign currency exchange rates the company is subject to changes in various foreign currency exchange rates  primarily including the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar  swedish krona  chinese yuan and polish zloty in the conversion from local currencies to the us dollar of the reported financial position and operating results of its non us based subsidiaries 
an adverse change weakening dollar of in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in sales of million and a decrease in operating income of million for the year ended september
