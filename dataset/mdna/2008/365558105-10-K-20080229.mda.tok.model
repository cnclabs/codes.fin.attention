patents  trademarks and other intellectual property the company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence  creativity and marketing abilities of its employees than on any individual patent  trademark or copyright 
nevertheless  as part of its ongoing research  development and manufacturing activities  gardner denver has a policy of seeking to protect its proprietary products  product enhancements and processes with appropriate intellectual property protections 
in the aggregate  patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of gardner denver s products 
however  the company does not consider any single patent or trademark  or group of patents or trademarks  to be material to its business as a whole  except for the gardner denver trademark 
other important trademarks the company uses include  among others  aeon  belliss morcom  bottarini  champion  cycloblower  drum  duroflow  elmo rietschle  emco wheaton  hoffman  lamson  legend  nash  oberdorfer  opi  sutorbilt  tamrotor  thomas  todo  webster  welch and wittig 
pursuant to trademark license agreements  cooper has rights to use the gardner denver trademark for certain power tools 
gardner denver has registered its trademarks in the countries where it is deemed necessary or in the company s best interest 
the company also relies upon trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information and routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees 
there can be no assurance  however  that these protections are sufficient  that others will not independently obtain similar information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or that they can effectively be protected 
employees as of january  the company had approximately  full time employees 
the company believes that its current relations with employees are satisfactory

persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites

table of contents item a 
risk factors we have exposure to economic downturns and operate in cyclical markets 
as a supplier of capital equipment to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
demand for compressor and vacuum products is dependent upon capital spending by manufacturing  process  and transportation industries 
many of our customers  particularly industrial customers  will delay capital projects  including non critical maintenance and upgrades  during economic downturns 
demand for some of our fluid transfer products is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs and oil and natural gas prices 
the energy market  in particular  is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for these commodities is depressed  the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced 
accordingly  our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
the markets for our products have historically experienced downturns in demand 
future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we face robust competition in the markets we serve  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we actively compete with many companies producing the same or similar products 
depending on the particular product  we experience competition based on a number of factors  including quality  performance  price and availability 
we compete against many companies  including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the economy as a whole 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets 
if we cannot compete successfully  our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
large or rapid increases in the costs of raw materials or substantial decreases in their availability and our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our primary raw materials  directly and indirectly  are cast iron  aluminum and steel 
although we have a limited number of long term contracts with key suppliers and are seeking to enter into additional long term contracts  we do not have long term contracts with most of our suppliers 
consequently  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of raw materials 
we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings  motors and other select engineered components 
from time to time in recent years  we have experienced a disruption to our supply deliveries and may experience further supply disruptions 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and  therefore  our operating results 
we may not be able to continue to identify and complete other strategic acquisitions and effectively integrate such acquired companies to achieve desired financial benefits 
one of our growth strategies is to increase our sales and expand our markets through acquisitions 
we have completed acquisitions since becoming an independent company in we expect to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise 
however  we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions 
furthermore  our existing operations may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources  which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 

table of contents even if we can complete future acquisitions  we face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures  personnel  product lines  and operations in a timely and efficient manner 
the integration process can be complex and time consuming  may be disruptive to our existing and acquired businesses  and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  those businesses 
even if we can successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses into our operations  there is no assurance that anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements will be realized within the expected time frame  or at all 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states 
we have manufacturing facilities in germany  the united kingdom  china  brazil  italy  sweden  finland and canada 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available 
non us operations and non us export sales could be adversely affected as a result of nationalization of private enterprises  political or economic instability in certain countries  differences in foreign laws  including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights  changes in the legal and regulatory policies of foreign jurisdictions  credit risks  currency fluctuations  exchange controls  changes in tariff restrictions  royalty and tax increases  export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments  potential problems obtaining supply of raw materials  shipping products during times of crisis or war  and other factors inherent in foreign operations 
our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse impact 
none of our executive officers has an employment agreement 
in addition  with the worldwide tightening of labor markets  the availability of highly qualified talent is decreasing and the competition for talent is becoming more intense 
however  we provide long term equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers  including change in control agreements  which provide incentives for them to make a long term commitment to our company 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims  which could harm our business 
customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property  equipment or the environment 
in addition  our products are integral to the production process for some end users and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects 
we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size 
however  we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred 
we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable 
we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used 
the risk of regulatory noncompliance could have a significant impact on our business 
our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws  regulations and policies  which could result in conflicting legal requirements 
noncompliance with any applicable laws could result in enforcement actions  fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation 
in addition  changes in current legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  data protection  international trade or compliance requirements could adversely affect our operations  revenues and earnings as well as require us to modify our strategic objectives 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and workplace safety 
under such laws and regulations  we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and regulations 
we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are  or have been  used for industrial purposes 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws 
an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs which are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters 
if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations  we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with regulatory requirements relating to environmental matters  and many environmental laws impose joint and several liability for remediation for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination  or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources  and typically we are one of approximately or more named defendants 
in our experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which we bear responsibility 

table of contents we believe that the pending lawsuits are not likely to  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  could cause a different outcome 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately million  or of our total assets 
goodwill is generated in an acquisition when the cost of such acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are subject to impairment analyses at least annually 
we could be required to recognize reductions in our net income caused by the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  which  if significant  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
communication or information systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our clients 
our business is highly dependent on financial  accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems  including our enterprise resource planning tools 
we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems 
if any of these systems do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to grow could be limited 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot be certain that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism or war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality provisions  contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties  from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be costly and time consuming  and can divert management s attention and other resources 
depending on the resolution of such claims  we may be barred from using a specific technology or other right  may be required to redesign or re engineer a product  or may become liable for significant damages 
our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages or other labor difficulties 
as of january  we have approximately  full time employees 
a significant number of our employees  including a large portion of the employees outside of the us  are represented by works councils and labor unions 
although we do not anticipate future work stoppages by our union employees  there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur 
although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages  we cannot be assured that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or 
table of contents that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations 
the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs and or decreased operating results

the increase in diluted average shares outstanding in compared to  which was primarily due to shares issued in connection with the company s stock compensation programs  resulted in an approximately reduction in diluted earnings per share 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased million  or  to  million in  compared to  million in this increase was due to million of additional revenues resulting from the acquisitions of thomas and bottarini in and todo in and organic growth million  or 
higher shipment volume  especially from petroleum related fluid transfer products such as drilling and well stimulation pumps  contributed approximately million  or  of additional revenue 
in addition  price increases and favorable foreign currency translation contributed and  respectively  to year over year revenue growth 
international revenues were of total revenues in  down slightly from in revenues for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased to  million in compared to million in this increase was due to acquisitions completed in  increased shipment volume  price increases  and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluid transfer products segment revenues increased to million in compared to million in this improvement in revenues was primarily driven by increased shipment volume in most product lines  but in particular drilling and well stimulation pumps  price increases  acquisitions and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to million in  and as a percentage of revenues improved to in from in these improvements were attributable to acquisitions  cost reduction initiatives and leveraging fixed and semi fixed costs over higher production volume 
favorable sales mix also contributed to the year over year improvement as included a higher percentage of drilling and replacement pump parts shipments compared to these products have gross profit percentages above the company s average 
these factors were partially offset by the non recurring charge to depreciation expense of approximately million in associated with the finalization of the fair market value of the thomas property  plant and equipment 
cost of sales in was also negatively impacted by approximately million of non recurring costs attributable to inventory step up adjustments relating to recording the inventory of thomas and bottarini at fair value on the acquisition dates 
higher depreciation expense due to the incremental effect of acquisitions  decreases in manufacturing productivity related to product line relocations associated with acquisition integration projects in and material and other cost increases partially offset these improvements 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the majority of the increase was due to the incremental effect of acquisitions  including higher amortization expense  which contributed approximately million of additional selling and administrative expenses  million of incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r effective january   and the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by cost reductions realized through integration activities  net of inflationary factors such as salary increases  and a million non recurring reduction to amortization expense associated with the finalization of the fair market value of the thomas amortizable intangible assets 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in from in  due to increased leverage of these expenses over additional volume and the completion of various integration activities and cost reduction initiatives 
operating income consolidated operating income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in  and as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in these improvements reflect the revenue  gross profit and selling and administrative expense factors discussed above 
the compressor and vacuum products segment generated operating income of million and operating margin of in  compared to million and  respectively  in see note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes 
cost reductions  favorable sales mix and price increases accounted for the majority of the improvement 
these positive factors were partly offset by increased material costs and compensation related expenses 
the operating margin in was also reduced by approximately million of non recurring costs for inventory step up adjustments relating to the valuation of the inventory of thomas and bottarini at fair value on the acquisition dates 
the fluid transfer products segment generated operating income of million and operating margin of in  compared to million and  respectively  in see note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes 
this improvement was primarily due to increased revenue volume  the positive impact of increased leverage of the segment s fixed and semi fixed costs over additional production volume and price increases 
improved productivity  benefits from capital investments  favorable sales mix associated with a higher proportion of drilling pump and replacement pump parts shipments  and acquisitions also contributed to the improvement 

table of contents interest expense interest expense increased million to million in compared to this increase was primarily due to additional funds borrowed to finance the acquisition of thomas and higher average interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate  including the amortization of debt issuance costs  was in  compared to in the higher weighted average interest rate in was primarily attributable to increases in market rates on floating rate debt and the greater relative weight of the fixed interest rate on the company s senior subordinated notes as floating rate debt with lower interest rates was retired in see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements

the increase in diluted earnings per share was partly offset by higher average shares outstanding as a result of the impact of the issuance of million shares of the company s common stock during may adjusted for the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was completed on june  
outlook in general  the company believes that demand for compressor and vacuum products tends to correlate to the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial equipment production because air is often used as a fourth utility in the manufacturing process 
over longer time periods  the company believes that demand also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gross domestic product gdp around the world 
during  total industrial capacity utilization rates in the us  as published by the federal reserve board  remained above 
rates above have historically indicated a good demand environment for industrial equipment such as compressor and vacuum products 
the company expects the gdp rate of growth to slow in the us in but remain positive 
growth in industrial demand in europe is expected to exceed that of the us and asia is expected to continue to be the strongest region for growth and exceed the global average 
the company projects orders for compressor and vacuum products will remain strong through the first half of driven by demand in europe and asia for oem applications and engineered products  as well as marine and european mobile applications 
the company also expects increasing demand throughout the world for environmental applications  including flue gas desulfurization and flare gas and wastewater treatment 
as a result of these growth expectations  the company believes that demand for the industrial portion of its business will continue to grow in  although at a slightly slower rate than realized in 
table of contents production capacity for well stimulation pumps is sold out through the first half of  but the company has less visibility of the demand for petroleum pumps in the second half of the year 
it anticipates good demand for aftermarket parts and services for petroleum pumps in  but on going declines in demand in north america for drilling pumps 
however  quotations for international rigs and improved product availability may result in some incremental opportunities to ship drilling pumps during the year 
the company continues to invest in key machine tools in order to increase its production capacities for aftermarket parts and enable it to expand its market share in this area  which also helps mitigate the cyclicality of demand for these product lines 
order backlog consists of orders believed to be firm for which a customer purchase order has been received or communicated 
however  since orders may be rescheduled or canceled  backlog does not necessarily reflect future sales levels 
in  orders for compressor and vacuum products were  million  compared to  million in order backlog for the compressor and vacuum products segment was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increases in orders and backlog compared to the prior year were primarily due to stronger industrial demand and the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased orders and backlog in by approximately and  respectively 
future demand for petroleum related fluid transfer products has historically corresponded to market conditions  rig counts and expectations for oil and natural gas prices  which the company cannot predict 
orders for fluid transfer products were million in  compared to million in  representing a decrease of 
the orders decrease in petroleum pumps  due to the expected slow down in the north american market  more than offset an increase in orders for liquid natural gas and compressed natural gas loading arms and fuel systems 
the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased orders approximately in the year 
order backlog for the fluid transfer products segment was million at december   compared to million at december   representing a reduction 
the decrease in backlog was primarily associated with lower demand for drilling pumps used on north american land rigs  partially offset by increased demand for aftermarket parts and loading arms 
the increase in the loading arms backlog was primarily related to the receipt of certain contracts for liquid natural gas and compressed natural gas loading arms 
the company shipped approximately half of the loading arm contracts in december and expects to ship the remaining balance of the order in early fluid transfer segment revenues and operating income are expected to decline in compared to based on the company s expectations for declining shipments of petroleum pumps 
fluid transfer products segment operating margin is also expected to decline  primarily as a result of product mix and reduced leverage of fixed and semi fixed costs as production levels decrease 
liquidity and capital resources operating working capital during  operating working capital defined as accounts receivable plus inventories  less accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million to million 
this increase was driven by higher accounts receivable resulting from revenue growth during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  higher inventory levels required to support the planned increase in production volume and shipments in the first half of and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
despite the increase in inventory  inventory turns improved slightly to in from in due to the realization of benefits from the continued implementation of lean manufacturing initiatives and improved production throughput in as manufacturing integration projects were completed 
days sales outstanding increased to in from in primarily due to an increase in revenues outside the us  which typically offer longer payment terms 
the increase in accounts receivable was somewhat offset by higher customer advance payments which are included in accrued liabilities as a result of increased volume of engineered package sales 
net working capital defined as total current assets less total current liabilities was million at december   compared with million at december  
table of contents cash flows cash provided by operating activities of million in compares with cash provided by operating activities of million in this improvement reflects the increase in net income  partially offset by increased funding of operating working capital and a one time pension plan contribution 
cash used to fund operating working capital of million in increased million from million in  due primarily to volume related increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
in connection with the implementation in of certain revisions to its three defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom see note benefit plans  the company made an approximately million one time contribution into these plans 
net cash used in financing activities of million in and million in reflected the use of available cash and cash generated from operating activities to repay long term borrowings 
capital expenditures and commitments capital projects designed to increase operating efficiency and flexibility  expand production capacity  support acquisition integration projects and bring new products to market resulted in expenditures of approximately million in  compared to million in the higher spending in was primarily due to spending related to cost reduction initiatives and manufacturing capacity improvements 
capital expenditures related to environmental projects have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the foreseeable future 
in november  the company s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to acquire up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock  representing approximately of the company s outstanding shares 
all common stock acquired will be held as treasury stock and will be available for general corporate purposes 
this program replaces a previous program authorized in october for the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock  of which  shares remained available for repurchase 
the company has also established a stock repurchase program for its executive officers and directors to provide a means for them to sell the company s common stock and obtain sufficient funds to meet income tax obligations which arise from the exercise or vesting of incentive stock options  restricted stock or performance shares 
the company s board of directors has authorized up to  shares for repurchase under this program  and of this amount   shares remain available for repurchase as of december  as of december   a total of  shares have been repurchased at a cost of approximately million under both the october and the executive stock repurchase programs 
liquidity the company s primary cash requirements include working capital  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
the company s primary sources of funds are its ongoing net cash flows from operating activities and availability under its revolving line of credit as defined below 
at december   the company had cash and equivalents of million  of which million was pledged to financial institutions as collateral to support the issuance of standby letters of credit and similar instruments 
the company also had million of unused availability under its revolving line of credit at december  the company entered into a syndicated credit agreement in the credit agreement in connection with the thomas acquisition 
the credit agreement provides the company with access to senior secured credit facilities  including a term loan in the original principal amount of million  and a million revolving line of credit 
the term loan has a final maturity of july  and the outstanding principal balance at december  was million 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments aggregating approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the revolving line of credit matures on july  loans under this facility may be denominated in us dollars or several foreign currencies and may be borrowed by the company or two of its foreign subsidiaries as outlined in the credit agreement 
on december   the revolving line of credit had an outstanding principal balance of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 

table of contents the interest rates applicable to loans under the credit agreement vary  at the company s option  with the prime rate plus an applicable margin or libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin percentages are adjustable quarterly  based upon financial ratio guidelines defined in the credit agreement see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries  and are secured by a pledge of certain subsidiaries capital stock 
the company is subject to customary covenants regarding certain earnings  liquidity and capital ratios 
the company also issued million of senior subordinated notes the notes in the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and are guaranteed by certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
at any time prior to may   the company may redeem all or part of the notes issued under the indenture at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus an applicable premium in the range of to of the principal amount  and accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
in addition  at any time prior to may   the company may  on one or more occasions  redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings  subject to certain conditions 
on or after may   the company may redeem all or a part of the notes at varying redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
upon a change of control  as defined in the indenture  the company is required to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding for cash at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
the indenture contains events of default and affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for such financings  including  among other things  limits on incurring additional debt and restricted payments 
the company used cash generated from operating activities to reduce its borrowings by approximately million in debt to total capital was as of december  compared to as of december  subject to market conditions and other factors  the company intends to begin acquiring shares under the new share repurchase program discussed above in the first quarter of and complete the share repurchase program over the course of management currently expects the company s future cash flows will be sufficient to fund its scheduled debt service  its stock repurchase program and provide required resources for working capital and capital investments for at least the next twelve months 
the company is proactively pursuing acquisition opportunities  but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted 
in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms  the company may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional long term borrowings 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table and accompanying disclosures summarize the company s significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods dollars in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual cash obligations total year years years years debt estimated interest payments capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total estimated interest payments for long term debt were calculated as follows for fixed rate debt and term debt  interest was calculated based on applicable rates and payment dates  for variable rate debt and or non term debt  interest rates and payment dates were estimated based on management s determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument 
management expects to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings 

table of contents purchase obligations consist primarily of agreements to purchase inventory or services made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated as of december  for this reason  these numbers will not provide a complete and reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
 the total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  were million and represented the funded status of the company s defined benefit plans at the end of the total pension and other postretirement benefit liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line items accrued liabilities  postretirement benefits other than pensions and other liabilities 
because this liability is impacted by  among other items  plan funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets  it does not represent expected liquidity needs 
accordingly  the company did not include this liability in the contractual obligations table above 
the company funds its us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the company is committed to making the required minimum contributions and expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its us qualified pension plans during furthermore  the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its us postretirement health care benefit plans during future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets  benefit payment experience and changes  if any  to current funding requirements 
therefore  no amounts were included as contractual cash obligations in the above table 
the company generally expects to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
the company s non us pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its non us qualified pension plans during no amounts have been included in the contractual cash obligations table due to the same reasons noted above 
disclosure of amounts in the contractual cash obligations table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans 
in order to inform the reader about expected benefit payments for these plans over the next several years  the company anticipates the annual benefit payments for the us plans to be in the range of approximately million to million in and to remain at or near these annual levels for the next several years  and the annual benefit payments for the non us plans to be in the range of approximately million to million in and to increase by approximately million each year over the next several years 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented certain revisions to its three defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom and adjusted the net periodic benefit cost associated with these plans see note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net deferred income tax liabilities were million as of december  this amount is not included in the contractual cash obligations table because the company believes this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
in the normal course of business  the company or its subsidiaries may sometimes be required to provide surety bonds  standby letters of credit or similar instruments to guarantee its performance of contractual or legal obligations 
as of december   the company had million in such instruments outstanding and had pledged million of cash to the issuing financial institutions as collateral for such instruments 

table of contents contingencies the company is a party to various legal proceedings  lawsuits and administrative actions  which are of an ordinary or routine nature 
in addition  due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and other primary defendants  among other things  the company has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically the company is one of approximately or more named defendants 
in the company s experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which the company bears responsibility 
predecessors to the company sometimes manufactured  distributed and or sold products allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silicosis litigation lawsuits the products 
however  neither the company nor its predecessors ever mined  manufactured  mixed  produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica sand  the materials that allegedly caused the injury underlying the lawsuits 
moreover  the asbestos containing components of the products were enclosed within the subject products 
the company has entered into a series of cost sharing agreements with multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for asbestos and silicosis lawsuits 
the company also believes some of the potential liabilities regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements with other parties 
the company s uninsured settlement payments for past asbestos and silicosis lawsuits have not been material 
the company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silicosis lawsuits are not likely to  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  based on the company s anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters  the limited potential asbestos exposure from the components described above  the company s experience that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products or for which the company otherwise bears responsibility  various potential defenses available to the company with respect to such matters  and the company s prior disposition of comparable matters 
however  due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  could cause a different outcome  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws  which impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  the company was only a small contributor to these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense 
the company is also addressing three on site cleanups for which it is the primary responsible party 
two of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and the third is in the implementation stage 
the company is also participating in a voluntary cleanup program with other potentially responsible parties on a fourth site which is in the assessment stage 
based on currently available information  the company does not anticipate that any of these sites will result in material additional costs beyond those already accrued on its balance sheet 
the company has an accrued liability on its balance sheet to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated for its remaining financial obligations for these matters 
based upon consideration of currently available information  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition  liquidity or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations  or cleanup costs relating to the sites discussed above

revised  business combinations sfas no 
 which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business is to i recognize and measure in 
table of contents its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  ii recognize and measure the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determine what information to disclose to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date 
this replaces the guidance of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in addition  costs incurred by the acquirer to effect the acquisition and restructuring costs that the acquirer expects to incur  but is not obligated to incur  are to be recognized separately from the acquisition 
sfas no

this statement requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values 
an acquirer is required to recognize assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values  only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
this statement requires the acquirer to recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date  measured as a residual  which generally will be the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
contingent consideration should be recognized at the acquisition date  measured at its fair value at that date 
sfas no 
defines a bargain purchase as a business combination in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  and requires the acquirer to recognize that excess in earnings as attributable to the acquirer 
this statement is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early application is prohibited

 certain assumptions used in valuation methods sab 
sab expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of a simplified method in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r subsequent to december  the company used a simplified method to determine the expected term for the majority of its and options grants and is currently evaluating the effect sab will have on its financial statements and related disclosure requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
certain of these accounting policies 
table of contents require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
management believes that the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements related to these areas are based on their best judgments and estimates  although actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability to fully collect amounts due from its customers 
the allowance is determined based on a combination of factors including the length of time that the receivables are past due and the company s knowledge of circumstances relating to specific customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
if economic  industry  or specific customer business trends worsen beyond earlier estimates  the company may increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
inventory reserves inventories  which consist of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
as of december   million of the company s inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out fifo basis with the remaining million accounted for on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
goodwill and other intangibles intangible assets  including goodwill  are assigned to the operating divisions based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  generally to years 
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization  but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired or that there is a probable reduction in the fair value of an operating division below its carrying value 
this impairment testing requires comparison of carrying values to fair values 
when appropriate  the carrying value of impaired intangible assets is reduced to fair value 
the company estimates fair value using available information regarding expected future cash flows and a discount rate that is based upon the cost of capital specific to the company 
goodwill impairment is tested at the operating division level 
during the second quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment tests and determined that the carrying values of intangible assets not subject to amortization and goodwill were not impaired 
there were no events or changes in circumstances indicating that goodwill and other intangible assets might be materially impaired at december  warranty reserves the company establishes reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s products typically carry a one year warranty 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure 

table of contents employee medical and workers compensation benefit claims the company maintains accruals for estimated medical and workers compensation claims incurred  but unpaid or not reported 
the accruals are based on a number of factors  including historical experience and recent claims history  and are subject to ongoing revision as conditions change and new data becomes available 
in estimating the liability for medical claims  the company obtains estimates from an independent third party firm 
business combinations when the company acquires a business  the purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
management generally engages independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
the measurement of acquired contractual and contingent liabilities and the establishment of liabilities for employee termination and relocation costs and other exit costs in connection with an acquired business also require management to make significant estimates which may be subject to a certain degree of variability 
stock based compensation the company accounts for share based payment awards in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under sfas r  share based payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period 
determination of the fair values of share based payment awards at grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the relevant share based award and the expected volatility of the company s stock 
additionally  management must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected life of the share based awards is generally based on the simplified method for plain vanilla options and  for certain executives and nonemployee directors  the historical exercise behaviors of those individuals 
the expected volatility of the company s stock is based on its historical volatility over the expected term of the award 
expected forfeitures are based on historical experience 
pension and other postretirement benefits gardner denver sponsors a number of pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide 
the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors 
these assumptions include the discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations  future rate of compensation increases  expected rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates 
the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  and were derived by examining the rates of high quality  fixed income securities whose cash flows or duration match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments under the plans 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized through net periodic benefit cost over future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost 
actuarial valuations associated with the company s pension plans at december  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by approximately million 
please refer to note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures 
table of contents related to gardner denver s benefit plans  including quantitative disclosures reflecting the impact that changes in certain assumptions would have on service and interest costs and benefit obligations 
income taxes the calculation of gardner denver s income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
as part of the company s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors us and international tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the company s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments utilized in determining the income tax provision  and records adjustments as necessary 
loss contingencies contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of the potential loss 
the most significant contingencies impacting the company s financial statements are those related to product warranty  personal injury lawsuits  environmental remediation and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for additional information on these matters  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes and note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments all derivative financial instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges  any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the current period 
a derivative instrument may be designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in expected future cash flows if the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period of designation 
if a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings 
gains or losses on derivative instruments recognized in earnings are reported in the same line item as the associated hedged transaction in the consolidated statements of operations 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when it is determined that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  the derivative is sold  terminated or exercised  the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur within two months of the originally specified time period 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value 
when cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative is sold  terminated  or exercised  the net gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings or until it becomes unlikely that a hedged forecasted transaction will occur within two months of the originally scheduled time period 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because a hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the balance sheet and recognized as a gain or loss currently in earnings 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur within two months of the originally specified time period  the 
table of contents derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized immediately through earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks during the normal course of business  including those presented by changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of operating and financing activities 
the company selectively uses derivative financial instruments  including forwards and swaps  to manage the risks from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  and currency exchange rates can be volatile  and the company s risk management activities do not totally eliminate these risks 
consequently  these fluctuations could have a significant effect on the company s financial results 
notional transaction amounts and fair values for the company s outstanding derivatives  by risk category and instrument type  as of december  and  are summarized in note off balance sheet risk  concentrations of credit risk and fair value of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including aluminum 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including cast iron  aluminum  copper  and steel 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company has long term contracts with some of its suppliers of key components 
however  to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from its borrowings of million at december  the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable rate debt and uses pay fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative proportions 
including the impact of the million notional amount of such interest rate swaps in place  the interest rates on approximately of the company s borrowings were effectively fixed as of december  if the relevant libor amounts for all of the company s borrowings had been basis points higher than actual in  the company s interest expense would have increased by million 
exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations is conducted by its subsidiaries outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar 
almost all of the company s us subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies  which are also their functional currencies 
other than the us dollar  the euro  british pound  and chinese yuan are the principal currencies in which the company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions 
the company is exposed to the impacts of changes in currency exchange rates on the translation of its non us subsidiaries assets  liabilities  and earnings into us dollars 
the company partially offsets these exposures by having certain of its non us subsidiaries act as the obligor on a portion of its borrowings and by denominating such borrowings  as well as a portion of the borrowings for which the company is the obligor  in currencies other than the us dollar 
of the company s total net assets of  million at december  
table of contents approximately million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
borrowings by the company s us subsidiaries at december  totaled million  and the company s consolidated borrowings denominated in currencies other than the us dollar totaled million 
fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates in the value of non us dollar borrowings that have been designated as hedges of the company s net investment in foreign operations are included in other comprehensive income 
the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the risk that arises when they  from time to time  enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency 
to mitigate this risk  the company and its subsidiaries typically settle intercompany trading balances monthly 
the company also selectively uses forward currency contracts to manage this risk 
at december   the notional amount of open forward currency contracts was million and their aggregate fair value was million 
to illustrate the impact of currency exchange rates on the company s financial results  the company s operating income would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar had been percent more valuable than actual relative to other currencies 
this calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion to the us dollar and that there are no indirect effects of the change in the value of the us dollar such as changes in non us dollar sales volumes or prices
