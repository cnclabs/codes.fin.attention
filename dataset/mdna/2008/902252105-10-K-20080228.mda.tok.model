overview we provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments 
we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology it needs of cities  counties  schools and other local government entities 
in addition  we provide professional it services to our customers  including software and hardware installation  data conversion  training and for certain customers  product modifications  along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems 
we also provide subscription based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting services as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 
our products are generally grouped into four major areas financial management and education  courts and justice  property appraisal and tax  and document management 
we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses  subscription based services  software services  appraisal services  and maintenance and support 
because the majority of the software we sell is off the shelf  increased sales of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins 
thus  the most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales 
in addition  new software license sales generally generate implementation services revenues as well as future maintenance and support revenues  which we view as a recurring revenue source 
we also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should increase due to our historically low customer turnover 
cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation  subscription based services and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses  subscription based services  and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
as of december   our total full time equivalent employee count increased to  from  at december  the majority of these additions were to our implementation and support staff  including additions to our capacity to deliver our backlog  particularly for our odyssey courts and justice solutions 
our implementation and support staff at december  includes full time equivalent employees added as a result of two acquisitions completed in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions generally fluctuate with revenues but other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 
liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
uses of cash include acquisitions  capital investments in software development and property and equipment and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
during we used cash of million to acquire two companies and miscellaneous other software assets 
in  we also purchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues  cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage of completion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition  the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  determination of share based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting  with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses  subscription based services  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
in a limited number of cases  we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service  and we may offer a concession to such customer 
in those limited situations where we grant a concession  we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee  but alternatively may perform additional services  such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution 
these amounts have historically been considered nominal 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  we review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

table of contents for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  which is considered essential to its functionality  and for substantially all property appraisal outsourcing projects  we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentage of completion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  and apply the provisions of sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects  some of which can range up to three years 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 
for subscription based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting arrangements  we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting  as defined by eitf  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements  ii the element has stand alone value to the customer  iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and iv there is a general right of return 
we consider the applicability of eitf no 
 application of sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware on a contract by contract basis 
in hosted term based agreements  where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software  hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has access to the software 
for professional services associated with hosting arrangements that we determine do not have stand alone value to the customer  we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value  generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the 
table of contents business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 
share based compensation 
we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees  directors and non employee consultants 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recorded because the exercise prices of the stock options equaled the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grants 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for share based awards exchanged for employee services  using the modified prospective application transition method 
subsequently  we recorded compensation expense in our statement of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
share based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
estimated option life is determined using the simplified method in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december   and compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses subscriptions software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total financial management and education courts and justice appraisal and tax and other total revenues 
table of contents in we signed material new contracts with average software license fees of approximately  compared to material new contracts signed in with average software license fees of approximately  we consider contracts with a license fee component of  or more to be material 
although a contract is signed in a particular year  the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to our financial management and education solutions for decreased compared to the prior year 
over half the decline was due to product mix in that required less third party software 
a portion of the remaining decline was mainly due to a number of customers in choosing our subscription based options  rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 
although these customers represented a relatively small percentage of new customers  the size of those contracts was larger than in the prior year 
subscription based arrangements result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangement but generate higher overall subscription based services revenue over the term of the contract 
software license revenue related to our courts and justice software solutions increased for compared to the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded software license revenue of approximately million from a contract which had been deferred in accordance with the terms of the contract 
appraisal and tax and other software license declined in compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of software license revenue on a customer arrangement pending establishment of a revised timeline for the completion of certain development and implementation services 
we currently expect a revised implementation schedule will be established and we will collect the remaining license fees contained in the arrangement 
subscriptions 
subscription based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings  software subscriptions and disaster recovery services 
asp and other software subscriptions agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement 
disaster recovery and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually 
new asp customers provided approximately two thirds of the subscription revenue increase due to further expansion into existing markets and new markets such as pennsylvania and texas 
software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions  which comprises approximately half of our software services revenue in the years presented  experienced modest increases compared to the prior year due to increased contract volume and additions to implementation and training staff which enabled us to deliver our backlog at a faster rate 
excluding the impact of acquisitions we have added approximately people to our financial management and education implementation and training staff over the last twelve months 
software services revenue related to our courts and justice solutions experienced substantial increases compared to the prior year  reflecting increased contract volume 
we had approximately active odyssey contracts in compared to approximately active odyssey contracts in  primarily due to continued expansion in texas and florida and a new contract with indiana 
we have added approximately people to our courts and justice implementation and training staff over the last twelve months 
software services revenue related to appraisal and tax and other solutions  which comprise approximately of our software services revenue in the periods presented  had moderate increases for compared to the prior year 
the majority of the increase is related to one large appraisal and tax software implementation  which was substantially completed by december  the level of appraisal and tax software services revenues for will depend on our ability to replace the revenues associated with this large implementation 
maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased over the prior year due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our solutions 

table of contents appraisal services 
appraisal services are project oriented and are driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states 
appraisal services revenue for was higher than the prior year period 
the increase was due to activity related to ohio s revaluation cycle  which occurs every six years  and a million contract with fulton county  georgia  which began late in the ohio revaluation projects began with smaller counties late in the first quarter of and expanded to larger counties by the third quarter of a substantial portion of the ohio revaluation projects was complete by december  we anticipate appraisal services revenues for will decline moderately compared to if we are unable to replace the appraisal services revenues associated with the ohio revaluation 
cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related change in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december gross margin percentages change software licenses and acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware overall gross margin software license 
the main component of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products  with third party software costs making up the balance 
once a product is released  we begin to amortize  over the estimated useful life of the product  any capitalized costs associated with its development 
amortization expense is determined on a product by product basis at an annual rate not less than straight line basis over the product s estimated life  which is generally five years 
development costs consist mainly of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our developers  and rent for related office space 
for our software license gross margin percentage increased slightly compared to the prior year because our product mix in included less third party software  which has higher associated costs than proprietary software 
the gross margin also benefited from lower amortization expense of software development costs because some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
cost of software services  maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery 
for the software services  maintenance and 
table of contents subscription gross margin percentage increased over the prior year because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
we have increased our implementation and support staff by full time equivalent employees since december  this increase includes additional employees related to acquisitions completed in the remaining additions were to increase our capacity to train and deliver our contract backlog  particularly for our courts and justice solutions 
appraisal services 
higher revenues associated with increased activity on the ohio revaluation projects contributed to the slight appraisal services gross margin percentage increase 
our blended gross margin for was flat compared to the prior year due to a revenue mix that included less software license and significant additions to our development and implementation staff to deliver our growing backlog 
software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as professional services and hardware 
although the revenue mix for also included less software license than the prior year  the negative impact on the gross margin was offset by lower third party software costs as well as lower amortization expense of software development costs described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses sg a costs grew at a slower rate than revenues in due to leverage in the utilization of our administrative and sales staff 
research and development expense the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues research and development expense for  research and development expense included costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project  in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts 
in  we reduced our research and development expense by million  which was the amount earned under the terms of our strategic alliance with microsoft 
we anticipate these costs and associated reimbursements from microsoft will continue into  however  the actual amount and timing of those costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed  may vary 

table of contents amortization of customer and trade name intangibles acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles 
the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as a non operating expense 
the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are to years 
the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december change in thousands amortization of customer and trade name intangibles estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles  excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues  for the next five years is as follows in thousands other in interest income is the main component of other income 
other income in also includes non usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january and gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract 
interest income in was million compared to million in the increase in interest income is due to higher invested cash balances as the result of positive cash flow in income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes  non deductible share based compensation expense  the qualified manufacturing activities deduction  and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
the effective rate for was lower than the effective tax rate mainly due to changes in the texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of and favorable state income tax audit results 
slightly more than half of our stock option awards granted qualify as incentive stock options iso for income tax purposes 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
stock option grants of non qualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset  which is a temporary difference  until the time that the option is exercised 
due to the treatment of incentive stock options for tax purposes  our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

table of contents compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses subscriptions software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to financial management and education solutions  which comprise approximately of our software license revenues in the years presented  increased significantly compared to the prior year primarily due to growth from geographic expansion and increased success in winning larger contracts 
third party software revenue also increased over the comparable prior year because we sold more financial software modules that utilize third party software 
also  in late we simplified the implementation process for one of our financial products  which has enabled us to deliver the product more rapidly 
in software license revenue related to our products other than financial management and education solutions experienced strong increases in the aggregate compared to software license revenues from our odyssey courts and justice products experienced a substantial increase over the prior year as a result of the product maturing following successful early implementations and leveraging our existing customer base 
in addition  licenses of our tax and appraisal products and a document management product were much higher than the prior year due to several new java based product releases and increased appraisal revaluation activity 
our appraisal software license volume varies from period to period dependent upon the special needs and timing of our customers 
local government taxing entities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process 
while certain of these taxing jurisdictions contract with our appraisal services division to perform the reappraisals  it is not always necessary for the customer to purchase new software in order to process the appraisals 
in some cases  a customer may simply add additional appraisal software modules to enhance the functionality of its existing software 
subscriptions 
subscription based services increased primarily due to new customers for asp and disaster recovery services as a result of geographic expansion  primarily in the south in the aftermath of hurricane katrina 
software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions  which comprise more than half of our software service revenue in the years presented  increased significantly in compared to the prior year reflecting increased contract volume and additions to training staff which enabled us to deliver our backlog at a faster rate 
software services revenue related to odyssey courts and justice solutions was up moderately in compared to reflecting increased contract volume 
since march   we have increased our presence with odyssey in texas  florida and michigan and added one contract in nevada 
odyssey software services revenue did not increase as strongly as odyssey software license revenue because the prior year included a million contract for follow on services to an existing customer that had previously implemented and accepted the software 
software services revenue related to our document management solutions experienced strong increases in due to several new java based product releases 

table of contents maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 
appraisal services 
the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states 
appraisal services revenue increased over the prior year mainly due to activity related to ohio s revaluation cycle  which occurs every six years as well as the addition of new customers

our software license gross margin percentage in increased due to substantially higher software license revenues and slightly lower amortization expense of software development costs as some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
the software services  maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage in was comparable to the the cost of software services  maintenance and subscriptions increased because we added to our implementation and support staff to increase our capacity to support new sales growth and deliver sales backlog 
appraisal services 
the appraisal services gross margin percentage increased in compared to mainly due to significant organizational changes and headcount reductions we made in the second quarter of to our appraisal services business to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue 
in addition  margins in were negatively affected by cost inefficiencies associated with one large contract 

table of contents the overall gross margin percentage rose mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software license revenues  as well as lower costs as a result of the restructuring of our appraisal services business in the second quarter of software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as services and hardware 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses in sg a includes million of non cash share based compensation expense as a result of implementing sfas no

our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive superior service 
we reorganized the appraisal services business to eliminate levels of management and reduce overhead expense 
we also took actions to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax software division  and we consolidated certain senior management positions at the corporate office 
these cost reductions were made in the second quarter of as a result  we eliminated approximately positions  including management  staff and project related personnel 
in connection with the reorganization  we incurred certain charges which were primarily comprised of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits  and totaled approximately million before income taxes 
the related payments were paid in other interest income is the main component of other income  which also includes non usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january  gain on sale of certain assets  gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items

table of contents income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective rate for was lower than the prior year mainly due to changes in the texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of  favorable state income tax audit results and lower state income taxes as a result of a change in our corporate structure implemented in early the decline in the effective tax rate for was offset somewhat by non deductible share based compensation expense included in operating results 
financial condition and liquidity the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december in thousands cash flows provided by used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents historically  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   our combined cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million compared to million at december  cash and short term investments increased primarily due to continued strong operating performance and higher deferred revenue due to additional maintenance customers and new contract signings 
our short term investments are comprised of auction rate municipal securities ars 
ars are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are reset through a dutch auction process that occurs every to days 
we have the option to participate in the auction and sell ars to prospective buyers through a broker dealer 
we do not have the right to put the security back to the issuer 
our investments in ars all had aaa credit ratings at the time of purchase and represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies 
ars are considered highly liquid because of the auction process  which have historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
however  because the ars have long term maturity dates  there is no guarantee that the holder will be able to liquidate its holdings in the short term 
as of february   our investment in ars was million compared to million at december  in  the majority of the auctions we participated in were successful and we expect that we will collect the principal associated with these ars 
based on the nature of the debt obligations and our ability to liquidate our ars in we do not believe that any change in the liquidity of the ars market will have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow or ability to fund operations 
at december   our days sales outstanding dsos were days compared to dsos of days at december  dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding long term receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by days 
the decline in dsos is primarily due to timing of billings

subsequent to december  and through february  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
we maintain a million letter of credit facility under which the bank issues cash collateralized letters of credit 
as of december  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 
in the first quarter of we acquired two companies for a combined cash purchase price net of cash acquired of approximately million and  shares of tyler common stock 
we have not finalized the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies but expect this allocation will result in non cash charges that may have a slightly dilutive effect on earnings per share in excluding acquisitions  we anticipate that capital spending will be between million and million  the majority of which will be related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansions 
we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in but the actual amount and timing of those costs  and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development 
capital spending in is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 
from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
in order to pursue such opportunities  which could require significant commitments of capital  we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 
in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses  we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months 
if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs  we believe that credit would be available to us 
we lease office facilities  as well as transportation  computer and other equipment used in our operations under non cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 
following are the future obligations under non cancelable leases at december  in thousands thereafter total future rental payments under operating leases it is not our usual business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements or to issue guarantees to third parties 
as of december  we have no material purchase commitments  except for the operating lease commitments listed above
