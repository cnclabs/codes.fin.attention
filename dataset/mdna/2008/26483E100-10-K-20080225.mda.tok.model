our sales force we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our customers solutions  of which approximately  were in our us segment and were in our international segment as of december  our sales force includes relationship managers and solution specialists who sell to our higher revenue customers  teams of telesales people who sell to our lower revenue customers and a team that sells to resellers of our solutions and our data 
we deliver our solutions primarily through the web and other electronic methods  including desktop and enterprise application software  as well as through third party resellers and enterprise software vendors 
our customers we believe that different size customers have different needs and require different skill sets to service them 
accordingly  we have adopted a go to market sales strategy that focuses on distinct groups categorized internally as large customers  middle market customers and small market customers 
our large customers are those having spend with us of million or more  while our middle market customers are those having spend with us of between  and million and our small market customers are those having spend with us of  or less 
our principal customers within these groups are banks and other credit and financial institutions  manufacturers  wholesalers  insurance companies and telecommunication companies  as well as sales  marketing and business development professionals 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total 
table of contents revenue or of the revenue of our us or international segments 
accordingly  neither we nor either of our segments is dependent on a single customer or a few customers  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations or the annual results of either of our segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
a number of competitors are active in specific aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright quality process 
in the us  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of market share and revenue  including revenue from sales of third party business credit information 
we compete with our customers own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers risk management processes to capture more of their internal spend 
we also directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc 
experian  which have traditionally offered primarily consumer information services  but now offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also compete in the us with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our sales marketing solutions and supply management solutions as well as our customers own purchasing departments 
in our sales marketing solutions business  our direct competitors include companies such as experian and infousa  inc infousa 
in our supply management solutions business  we directly compete with consulting firms  specialty data providers and specialty software companies 
in our e business solutions  hoover s competition varies based on the size of the customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of product pricing  hoover s pro  hoover s pro plus and hoover s pro premium products compete with other business information providers such as infousa 
on the lower end of product pricing  our hoover s lite solution mainly competes with advertising supported websites and other free or low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and marketwatch  inc outside the us  the competitive environment varies by country  and in some countries we are a market leader 
for example  in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  such as cerved in italy and experian in the united kingdom uk 
in addition  common links exist among some of these competitors through their membership in european information network alliances  such as bignet experian and we believe that competitors may be pursuing the establishment of their own pan european network through direct investment eg  coface  which could ultimately be positioned by them as an alternative to our d b worldwide network 
however  we believe we offer superior solutions when compared to these networks because of our dunsright quality process 
in addition  the sales marketing solutions landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
we also face significant competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
for example  in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy above  we believe that our trusted brand  our financial flexibility  our winning culture and our dunsright quality process form a powerful competitive advantage 

table of contents our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring and sources of data not publicly available  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  and attract and retain a high performing workforce 
intellectual property we own and control various intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  confidential information  trademarks  trade names  copyrights  patents and applications therefor 
these rights  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
we also believe that each of the d b name and related trade names  marks and logos are of material importance to our business 
we are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others  and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 
we consider our trademarks  service marks  databases  software  patents  patent applications and other intellectual property to be proprietary  and we rely on a combination of statutory eg  copyright  trademark  trade secret  patent  etc 
and contract and liability safeguards for protection thereof throughout the world 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in this annual report on form k are trademarks  service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries 
we own patents and patent applications both in the us and in other selected countries of strategic importance to us 
the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection 
we believe that the protection of our innovative technology  especially technology pertaining to our proprietary dunsright quality process  through the filing of patent applications is a prudent business strategy and we will continue to seek to protect those assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital 
filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology 
however  these patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third parties and later asserted against us 
where appropriate  we may also consider asserting or cross licensing our patents 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  team members worldwide  of which approximately  were in our us segment and corporate and approximately  were in our international segment 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
there are no unions in our us segment 
workers councils and trade unions represent a portion of our employees in the european and latin american operations of our international segment

item a 
risk factors our business model is dependent upon third parties to provide data and certain operational services  the loss of which would materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely significantly on third parties to support our business model 
for example we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  including public record sources  we utilize single source providers in certain countries that support the needs of our customers around the globe and rely on members of our d b worldwide network to provide local data in countries in which we do not directly operate  we have outsourced various functions  such as our technology help desk and network management functions in the us and the uk  and we have also outsourced certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery and customer service processes 
if one or more data providers were to withdraw their data  cease making it available  substantially increase the cost of their data  or not adhere to our data quality standards  our ability to provide solutions and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could materially impact our business and financial results 
similarly  if one of our outsource providers  including third parties with whom we have strategic relationships  were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us would suffer or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all  materially impacting our business and financial results 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we could replace our large third party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 

table of contents in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
large web search engine companies can provide low cost alternatives to data gathering and change how our customers perform key activities such as marketing campaigns 
such companies  and other third parties which may not be readily apparent today  may become significant low cost competitors and adversely impact the demand for our solutions and services 
weak economic conditions also can result in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we are facing increased competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information solutions to help their customers make credit decisions regarding small businesses 
in addition  consumer information companies are seeking to expand their operations more broadly into aspects of the business information space 
while their presence is currently small in the business information market  given the size of the consumer market in which they play  they have scale advantages in terms of scope of operations and size of relationship with customers  which they can potentially leverage to an advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based upon a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring  and sources of data not publicly available  demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth  deliver reliable and high quality business information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  adopt and maintain an effective information technology infrastructure to support product delivery as customer needs and preferences change and competitors offer more sophisticated products  attract and retain a high performance workforce  enhance our existing services and introduce new services  and improve our international business model and data quality through the successful management in our international segment of the members of our d b worldwide network 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm our brand and result in a loss of sales and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our solutions is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  which have occasionally been resolved by the payment of money damages 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our solutions 

table of contents also  we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the third parties to whom we grant non exclusive licenses and by customers  they may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  it cannot be assured that these licensees and customers will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our data solutions or technologies 
our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 
our brand and its attributes are key assets of the company 
our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of data quality  business practices and overall financial condition 
negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation with customers and the public  which could make it difficult for us to attract and maintain customers 
adverse developments with respect to our industry may also  by association  negatively impact our reputation  or result in higher regulatory or legislative scrutiny 
although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand  negative perceptions or publicity could materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely on annual contract renewals for a substantial part of our revenue and our quarterly results may be significantly impacted by the timing of these renewals or a shift in product mix that results in a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
in addition  our results of operations from period to period may vary due to the timing of customer contract renewals 
as contracts are renewed  we have  and may continue to experience  a shift in product mix underlying such contracts 
this could result in the deferral of increased amounts of revenue into future periods as a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of our contracts rather than upfront at contract signing 
although this may cause our financial results from period to period to vary substantially  such change in revenue recognition will not change the total revenue recognized over the life of our contracts 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may adversely impact our ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data and may impact our financial results 
certain types of information we gather  compile and publish are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in certain markets in which we operate  particularly in our international markets 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and the ubiquity of the internet 
these concerns may result in new laws and regulations 
in general  compliance with existing laws and regulations has not to date materially impacted our business and financial results 
nonetheless  future laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of information  and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information  could materially impact our business and financial results 
this could result in legislative or regulatory limitations being imposed on our operations  increased compliance or litigation expense and or loss of revenue 
in addition  governmental agencies may seek  from time to time  to increase the fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire  use and or redistribute data that such governmental agencies collect 
while we would seek to pass along any such price increases to our customers or provide alternative services  there is no guarantee that we would be able to do so  given competitive pressures or other considerations 
in addition  any such price increases or alternative services may result in reduced usage by our customers and or loss of market share 

table of contents we may be unable to achieve our financial aspirations  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we have established financial aspirations for the through time frame with respect to the financial performance that we believe would be achieved based upon our planned business strategy for the next several years 
these financial aspirations can only be achieved if the assumptions underlying our business strategy are fully realized some of which we cannot control eg  market growth rates  macroeconomic conditions and customer preferences 
as part of our annual planning process we will review these assumptions and we intend to provide our financial guidance to shareholders on an annual basis 
we may be unable to adapt successfully to changes in our customers preferences for our solutions  which could adversely impact our revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our solutions to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or changing economic conditions are changing the way our customers use and purchase business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding both lower prices and more features from our solutions  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats 
if we do not successfully adapt our solutions to our customers preferences  our business and financial results would be materially adversely impacted 
specifically  for our larger customers  our continued success will be dependent on our ability to satisfy more of their needs by providing solutions beyond data  such as enhanced analytics and assisting with their data integration efforts 
for our smaller customers  our success will depend in part on our ability to simplify our solutions and pricing offerings  to enhance our marketing efforts to these customers and to improve our service to them 
to address customer needs for pricing certainty and increased access to our solutions  we provide subscription pricing plans through our preferred pricing agreement and our preferred pricing agreement with dnbi 
these subscription pricing plans provide expanded access to our risk management solutions in a way that provides more certainty over related costs to the customer  which  in turn  generally results in customers increasing their spend on our solutions 
these plans have been an important driver of our growth in  and our success moving forward is dependent  in part  on the continued penetration of these offerings and the successful rollout of similar programs in various markets around the world 
similarly  our continued success is dependent on customers acceptance of our dnbi offering 
acquisitions  joint ventures or similar strategic relationships may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies or enter into joint ventures or similar strategic relationships 
these transactions are subject to the following risks acquisitions  joint ventures or similar relationships may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any such transaction into our operations  we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any such transaction  and risks  exposures and liabilities of acquired entities or other third parties with whom we undertake a transaction  that arise from such third parties activities prior to undertaking a transaction with us 
our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide publicly 
we provide full year financial guidance to the public which is based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance 
this includes  for example  assumptions regarding our ability to grow revenue  to provide profitable operating income  to achieve desired tax rates and to generate cash 
we believe that our 
table of contents financial guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of our view of our near term financial performance 
such financial guidance may not always be accurate  however  due to our inability to meet the assumptions we make and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors and in our public filings with the sec or otherwise 
if we fail to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance as we conduct our operations throughout the year  the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
we have no direct management control over third party members of the d b worldwide network who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets 
the d b worldwide network is comprised of both wholly owned subsidiaries and third party members who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets 
while third party member participation in the d b worldwide network is controlled by commercial services agreements and the use of our trademarks is controlled by license agreements  we have no direct management control over these members beyond the terms of the agreements 
as a result  actions or inactions taken by these third party members may have a material impact on our business and financial results 
for example  one or more third party members may provide a product or service that does not adhere to our data quality standards  fail to comply with d b brand and communications standards  engage in illegal or unethical business practices  elect not to support new or revised products and services or other strategic initiatives  or fail to execute other data or distribution contract requirements 
such actions or inactions may have an impact on customer confidence in the d b brand globally  which could materially adversely impact our business and financial results 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel  including members of our sales force  which could impact the quality of our performance and customer satisfaction 
our success and financial results also depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel at all levels  including members of our sales force on whom we rely for the vast majority of our revenue  and to appropriately use the time and resources of such individuals 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or key members of our sales teams  or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees  including members of our sales force  with appropriate qualifications 
we may lose key business assets or suffer interruptions in product delivery  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links  the internet  or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  impacts of terrorism  breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers  natural disasters  or other disasters 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
in addition  we generate a significant amount of our revenue through telesales centers and websites that we use in the acquisition of new customers  fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries 
we may not have sufficient redundant operations or change management processes in connection with our introduction of new web based products or services to prevent a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner 
any damage to our data centers  failure of our 
table of contents telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements and materially impact our business and financial results 
our operations in the international segment are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries  which could materially impact our business and financial results 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside the united states 
for the three years ended december   and  our international segment accounted for  and of total revenue 
our international business is subject to many challenges  the most significant being our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets  thus reducing the demand for our risk management solutions  and in some markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing a customer s need to purchase our data 
our international strategy includes the leveraging of our d b worldwide network to improve our data quality 
we form and manage these strategic alliances to create a competitive advantage for us over the long term  however  these strategic relationships may not be successful or may be subject to ownership change 
the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various international markets  and we operate in an evolving regulatory environment that could adversely impact aspects of our business or the business of third parties on whom we depend 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors may include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions  competition from government agencies in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations and strategic alliances  including the d b worldwide network  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions 
we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth which would materially impact our business and financial results 
successful execution of our strategy includes reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives to produce our desired revenue growth 
the success of this program may be affected by our ability to continually adapt and improve our organizational design and efficiency to meet the changing needs of our business and our customers  our ability to implement all of the actions required under this program within the established time frame  our ability to implement actions that require process or technology changes to reduce our expense base  
table of contents entering into or amending agreements with third party vendors to renegotiate terms beneficial to us  managing third party vendor relationships effectively  completing agreements with our local works councils and trade unions related to potential reengineering actions in certain international markets  and maintaining quality around key business processes utilizing our reduced and or outsourced resources 
if we fail to reduce our expense base  or if we do not achieve our desired level of revenue growth from new initiatives  our business and financial results would be materially impacted 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on us 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigations that arise in the ordinary course of business

see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
on december   we completed the sale of our italian real estate business which was a part of our international segment and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the italian real estate business as discontinued operations as set forth in this annual report on form k to reflect this reclassification 
the financial statements for our subsidiaries outside the us and canada reflect a fiscal year ended november  in order to facilitate timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position 
accordingly  the related assets and liabilities of our italian real estate business have been classified as held for sale in the balance sheet and we will record the resulting gain from the sale in the first quarter of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business for internal management purposes  we refer to core revenue  which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses 
core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure 
core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue 
on december   we completed the sale of our italian real estate business which was a part of our international segment and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the italian real estate business as discontinued operations as set forth in this annual report on form k to reflect this reclassification 
the financial statements for our subsidiaries outside the us and canada reflect a fiscal year ended november    and  in order to facilitate timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position 
accordingly  the related assets and liabilities of our italian real estate business have been classified as held for sale in the balance sheet and we will record the resulting gain from the sale in the first quarter of we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another  both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange 
core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
we have historically from time to time and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides insight into the underlying health of our business 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
a recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges  which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as financial flexibility 
through financial flexibility  management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of quality  efficiency and cost  in order to generate savings primarily to invest for growth 
such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period 
management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures 
management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries  target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved 
management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures  and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges  business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders  rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation 
additionally  transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy are reported as corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for financial information regarding our segments 

table of contents similarly  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate defined as provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value 
it should not be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
we also use free cash flow to manage our business 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for  or superior to  net cash flows provided by operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods  to allocate resources  to evaluate business performance and  as noted above  for compensation purposes 
however  these financial measures results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate  diluted earnings per share  or net cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all  the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis 
overview we manage and report our operations under the following two segments united states us  and international which consists of operations in europe  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us and canada reflect a fiscal year ended november to facilitate the timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position

our value added sales marketing solutions constituted the following percentages of total sales marketing solutions revenue and core revenue for the years ended december  sales marketing solutions revenue core revenue our flexible business model and restructuring since the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy  we have implemented financial flexibility programs 
financial flexibility is an ongoing process by which we seek to reallocate our spending from low growth or low value activities to other activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth  improved profitability and or quality improvements 
with each program we have incurred restructuring charges which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  contract terminations  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations  less assumed sublease income and transition costs which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
an integral component of our strategy is creating financial flexibility to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value 
through our financial flexibility program we continually and systematically seek ways to improve our performance in terms of quality and cost 
specifically  we seek to eliminate  standardize  consolidate and automate our business functions 
as a part of each program  we have incurred a restructuring charge  which generally consists of  among other things  employee severance and termination costs 
we also have incurred transition costs  which generally consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  cost of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
our financial flexibility program  which was approved on january   builds on efforts initiated in to reduce significantly the complexity of our business  a process that we anticipate continuing over the next several years 
specifically  in  we will continue to address complexity reduction and create financial flexibility through several initiatives including the following enhancing organizational effectiveness this initiative is intended to reduce organizational complexity and improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by continuing to address spans of control  consolidating like functions and eliminating non essential activities  simplifying our products and technology this initiative is intended to simplify the various platforms and products we offer our customers and moving to fewer and easier to use web based platforms like dnbi and hoover s and eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure  streamlining data collection and product ordering this initiative is intended to standardize and automate processes to drive efficiencies and quality to support our overall dunsright data strategy  and improving overall business effectiveness this initiative is intended to improve the efficiencies of our operations by centralizing management of key cost drivers  vendor consolidation and contract renegotiation 
in addition  we are focusing on driving revenue growth by reducing the non selling time of our sales force  enhancing our new customer acquisition activities and go to market approaches 
on an annualized basis  the actions under our financial flexibility program are expected to create million to million of financial flexibility  of which approximately million to million will be generated in  before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by 
table of contents the initiatives 
we expect all actions under our program to be completed by december to implement these initiatives we expect to incur transition costs of approximately million to million in in addition  we expect to incur restructuring charges totaling million to million pre tax  of which million to million relate to severance  approximately million relate to lease termination obligations and approximately million relate to other exit costs in approximately million to million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures 
as a result of this financial flexibility program we expect that approximately positions will be eliminated globally 
our critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein  we have applied the significant accounting policies described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates  the actual results could have a material impact on such period 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we previously offered substantially all of our us based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account the us qualified plan 
the defined benefit plan covers active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of spin off companies 
the benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employee s annual compensation 
the percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranges from to  based on age and service 
amounts allocated under the plan also receive interest credits based on the year treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the internal revenue service 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states the us non qualified plans to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the company 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for approximately and of our pension obligation  respectively  at december  effective june   we amended the us qualified plan and one of the us non qualified plans  known as the us pension benefit equalization plan the pbep 
any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits  other than interest on such amounts  will accrue under the us qualified plan and the pbep 
our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans  representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations 

table of contents we also provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees 
us based employees  who retire with years of vesting service after age  are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  our pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
other postretirement benefits ie  health care are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  amended by sfas no 
 and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by outside actuaries 
the key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments  discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
the discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans  rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators  and health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 
this assumption was  and in  and  respectively 
the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december   the plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real estate investments 
every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
based on the factors noted above  the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually 
for our us plans and postretirement benefit plan  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost and postretirement cost by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   for all of our us pension plans and our postretirement benefit plan  we increased the discount rate to and from and used at december   respectively 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in sfas no 
the purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of december  and were million and million  respectively  of 
table of contents which million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million  million and million  for the us qualified plan  us non qualified plans and non us plans  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  in the lower amortization of actuarial loss in of million and million related to the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans  respectively  which will be included in our pension cost in  is primarily due to lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses exceeding the corridor threshold under sfas no 
at january   primarily resulting from higher discount rates applied to the pension plans at december  as discussed above 
differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
we recorded net periodic pension cost for our pension plans of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a major component of the net periodic pension cost is the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic pension cost 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded investment gains of million  million and million  respectively  in our pension plans  of which million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan and million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the non us plans 
at january   the market related value of plan assets of our us qualified plan and the non us plans was  million and million  respectively  compared with the fair value of its plan assets of  million and million  respectively 
changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity 
we adopted sfas no 
as of december  and we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset  on a plan by plan basis  with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  or aoci  in shareholders equity  net of tax 
accordingly  the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs 
we recognized charges of million  net of applicable deferred taxes  to our shareholders equity in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 the previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs included in the shareholders equity would be amortized out of equity based on an actuarial calculation each period 
gains and losses and prior service costs that arise during the year will be recognized as a component of comprehensive income which is a component of aoci 
we recorded a net income of million in aoci  net of applicable tax  in related to the actuarial gain loss and prior service cost arising during the period and the amortization of such items 
a change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our benefit plans by changing the amount of the benefit obligation 
for the us qualified plan  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
for the us non qualified plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately million

table of contents stock based compensation our stock based compensation programs are described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payments  or sfas no 
r  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost associated with the stock option programs recognized for the years ended december  and includes a compensation cost for stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for stock options granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value under sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate future forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to only recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reductions in expense as they occur 
as a result  we have adjusted for this cumulative effect and recognized a pre tax reduction in stock based compensation of million related to our restricted stock and restricted stock unit programs during the first quarter of as required under the modified prospective method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our plans 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized for grants under the stock option programs and employee stock purchase plan espp prior to january  the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility rate of our common stock 
beginning in  the expected term was determined using the simplified method for estimating the expected option life  as prescribed under staff accounting bulletin or sab no 
 share based payments  or sab no 
the risk free interest rate for the corresponding expected term of the stock option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we estimate the amount of stock based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
for stock options granted prior to sfas no 
r  the compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
for stock options granted after the adoption of sfas no 
r  the compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period from the grant date to the date when retirement eligibility is achieved 
if factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our share based compensation expense  operating income  net income and earnings per share 
in connection with our dividend payments  we updated our dividend yield assumption in our black scholes valuation model from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   in calculating the fair value of our employee stock options 
we have estimated the dividend yield assumption by dividing the anticipated annual dividend payment by the stock price on the grant date 
contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts

matters impacting both operating expenses and selling and administrative expenses pension  postretirement and profit participation plan we had a net pension cost of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  for our pension plans globally 
the fluctuation in the pension cost was due to the following lower pension costs in were primarily due to the elimination of service costs as a result of the pension plan freeze in the us for the us qualified plan and pbep effective june  actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense as required by sfas no 
and the impact of the discount rates were also major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year 
the higher the discount rate  the lower the pension cost 
actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million were attributable to our us plans for the years ended december   and  respectively

lower postretirement benefit income for the years ended december  and compared with the year ended december   was primarily due to lower negative prior service cost amortizations recognized in and included in postretirement benefit income due to the accelerated recognition of prior service cost as a one time curtailment gain in associated with the and financial flexibility programs 
the curtailment gain is included within restructuring charges 
we expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately million in we had expense associated with our profit participation plan k plan of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in expense in was due to the amendment of our matching policy in the profit participation plan effective july   to increase our match formula from to of a team member s contributions and to increase the maximum match to seven percent from six percent  of such team member s eligible compensation  subject to certain k plan limitations 
we consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs  and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs

market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions and  from time to time  we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  from time to time  we use interest rate instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes  as discussed under interest rate risk below 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents interest rate risk management our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings  cash flows and financial position  and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure 
to manage our exposure  we may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
on september  and february   we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in treasury rates in the anticipation of the below referenced debt issuance 
these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges  and as such  changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in connection with the issuance of senior notes the notes  these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated  resulting in proceeds of approximately million at the date of termination 
the proceeds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the life of the notes 
in connection with the million  five year  fixed rate notes which matured in march  we entered into fixed to floating libor rate indexed interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of with a notional principal amount totaling million  and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term  fixed rate notes 
the arrangement was considered a highly effective hedge  and therefore the accounting for these hedges has no impact on earnings 
the changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
in march  we issued the notes  bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of  payable semi annually 
the proceeds were used to repay our existing million notes  bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of  which matured on march  the swap agreements also expired in march contemporaneous with the note repayment 
in january  we entered into a series of rate locks with a notional value of million to hedge treasury rate volatility in anticipation of a future debt issuance 
at december   we had a million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates  which we terminated on april   and then entered into a new million  five year bank revolving credit facility  which expires in april borrowings under the million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates 
at december  and december   we had million and million of floating rate debt outstanding under the million facility and million facility  respectively 
a basis point increase decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt during the year ended december   would result in an incremental increase decrease in annual interest expense of approximately million 
on january   we exercised a million expansion feature on our million credit facility expanding the total facility to million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
foreign exchange risk management we have numerous offices in countries outside the us and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local players 
our international operations generated approximately and of our core revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our assets as of december  and  respectively  were located outside the us our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional 
table of contents currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
in addition  we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our international earnings and investments 
we use short term  foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less 
these contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollar 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions hedge are recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions 
in addition  the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with net investment hedges  if any  are recorded as cumulative translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  from time to time  we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are mark to market at the end of each quarter and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
at december  and december   there were million and million in option contracts outstanding 
at december  and  we had a notional amount of approximately million and million  respectively  of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated intercompany loans 
gains and losses associated with these contracts were million and million  respectively  at december   million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  if exchange rates on average were to increase from year end levels  without the benefit of having hedging activities  the unrealized loss would be approximately million 
if exchange rates on average were to decrease from year end levels  without the benefit of having hedging activities  the unrealized gain would be approximately million 
however  the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
liquidity and financial position in connection with our focus on delivering total shareholder return tsr  we will remain disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash  maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash first  making ongoing investments in the business to drive growth  second  acquisitions that we believe will be value accretive to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth  and third  continuing to return cash to shareholders 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements  is sufficient to meet our short term needs  including the cash cost of restructuring charges  transition costs  contractual obligations and contingencies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  excluding the legal matters identified in said note for which exposures cannot be estimated or are not probable 
in addition  we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued focus on tsr 
we have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs  acquisitions and share repurchases 
such borrowings would be supported by our credit facility  when needed

financial flexibility program an integral component of our strategy is creating financial flexibility to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value 
through our financial flexibility program we continually and systematically seek ways to improve our performance in terms of quality and cost 
specifically  we seek to eliminate  standardize  consolidate and automate our business functions 
as a part of each program  we have incurred a restructuring charge  which generally consists of  among other things  employee severance and termination costs 
we also have incurred transition costs  which generally consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  cost of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
our financial flexibility program  which was approved on january   builds on efforts initiated in to reduce significantly the complexity of our business  a process that we anticipate continuing over the next several years 
specifically  in  we will continue to address complexity reduction and create financial flexibility through several initiatives including the following enhancing organizational effectiveness this initiative is intended to reduce organizational complexity and improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by continuing to address spans of control  consolidating like functions and eliminating non essential activities  simplifying our products and technology this initiative is intended to simplify the various platforms and products we offer our customers and moving to fewer and easier to use web based platforms like dnbi and hoover s and eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure  streamlining data collection and product ordering this initiative is intended to standardize and automate processes to drive efficiencies and quality to support our overall dunsright data strategy  and improving overall business effectiveness this initiative is intended to improve the efficiencies of our operations by centralizing management of key cost drivers  vendor consolidation and contract renegotiation 
in addition  we are focusing on driving revenue growth by reducing the non selling time of our sales force  enhancing our new customer acquisition activities and go to market approaches 
on an annualized basis  the actions under our financial flexibility program are expected to create million to million of financial flexibility  of which approximately million to million will be generated in  before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives 
we expect all actions under our program to be completed by december to implement these initiatives we expect to incur transition costs of approximately million to million in in addition  we expect to incur restructuring charges totaling million to million pre tax  of which million to million relate to severance  approximately million relate to lease termination obligations and approximately million relate to other exit costs in approximately million to million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures 
as a result of this financial flexibility program we expect that approximately positions will be eliminated globally
