item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in cautionary statement about forward looking statements below  in item a  risk factors in part i and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview southwestern energy company is an independent energy company primarily focused on the exploration and production of natural gas within the united states 
our operations principally are located in arkansas  oklahoma and texas 
we are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas gathering and marketing businesses  which we refer to collectively as our midstream services 
we operate principally in three segments exploration and production e p  midstream services and natural gas distribution 
upon the consummation of the pending sale of our utility subsidiary  arkansas western gas company  we will cease to have any natural gas distribution operations 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close approximately mid year pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  the assets and liabilities of arkansas western gas company awg have been reclassified as held for sale in our december  and balance sheets 
however  the results of operations for awg continue to be consolidated in the statements of operations and are not presented as discontinued operations 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business  which we achieve in our e p business through the drillbit 
we prepare economic analyses for each of the investment opportunities in our e p business and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested  which we refer to as pvi 
the pvi of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a discount rate 
our actual pvi results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments 
we derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our e p business and expect this to continue in the future 
we expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production 
in recent years  there has been significant price volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict 
these factors  which include weather conditions  political and economic events  and competition from other energy sources  impact supply and demand for natural gas  which determines the pricing 
in addition  the price we realize for our gas production is affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices 
our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natu ral gas  our ability to control costs and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers 
in  our gas and oil production increased to bcfe  and in our production increased to bcfe 
the increases in production in both and primarily resulted from increases in production from our fayetteville shale play in arkansas 
we are targeting gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of to over our production 
our year end reserves grew in to  bcfe  up from  bcfe at the end of these increases were also primarily fueled by the continued development of our fayetteville shale play 
we reported net income of million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  up from the prior year 
net income in increased approximately to million  or per share  compared to the increase in net income in was a result of increased production volumes in our e p segment  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses and increased interest expense 
the increase in net income in was a result of increased production volumes in our e p segment  a gain on the sale of our noark investment and decreased interest expense  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
our cash flow from operating activities increased to million in and to million in  primarily due to increases in net income and adjustments to net income for non cash expenses 
operating income for our e p segment was million in  million in and million in operating income for our e p segment increased in due to increased production volumes  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
operating income for our midstream services segment was million in  swn 
table of contents compared to million in and million in operating income for our midstream services segment increased in due to an increase in gathering revenues related to our fayetteville shale play and an increase in the margin generated from marketing of natural gas  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
operating income for our midstream services segment decreased in as increased gathering revenues were more than offset by increased operating costs and expenses and a decrease in the margin generated by our marketing activities 
operating income for our natural gas distribution segment was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in operating income for our natural gas distribution segment in resulted from a rate increase implemented in august  from colder weather and a decrease in operating costs and expenses 
the decrease in operating income for our natural gas distribu tion segment in resulted primarily from warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses 
our capital investments totaled approximately billion in  up from million in the prior year 
we invested billion in our e p segment in  compared to million in including million invested in drilling rigs and million in including million invested in drilling rigs 
funds for our capital investments were provided by borrowings under our revolving credit facility  cash flow from operations and cash proceeds from a december drilling rig sale and leaseback transaction 
as a result of our increased borrowings  our total debt to capitalization ratio increased to at december   up from at december  for  our planned capital investments are billion  approximately equal to the level of our capital investments  and include billion for our e p segment  million for our midstream services segment and million for other corporate purposes including improvements to the utility system in advance of the pending sale 
the billion of e p investments includes approximately billion for the development of our fayetteville shale play and approximately of our e p capital is allocated to drilling 
in addition to the planned investments in the fayetteville shale play  our e p investments in will also focus on our active drilling programs in east texas and other conventional drilling in the arkoma basin 
we expect our capital investments in to be funded from internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  funds raised in the debt mark ets and proceeds from the sale of our utility and the anticipated divestiture of certain e p assets

revenues increased in to million  primarily due to a increase in our production volumes 
we expect our production volumes to continue to increase primarily due to the development of our fayetteville shale play in arkansas 
gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and are subject to wide price fluctuations 
as of february   we have hedged bcf  bcf and bcf of our  and gas production  respectively  in order to limit our exposure to price fluctuations

table of contents operating income 
operating income from our e p segment was million in  an increase of from million in  as the increase in our revenues was partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
operating income was up in compared to as the increase in revenues was largely offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
production 
gas and oil production was up approximately to bcfe in and up to bcfe in  compared to prior periods 
the increase in was primarily the result of a bcf increase in production from our fayetteville shale play 
the increase in was the result of a bcf increase in production from our fayetteville shale play and a bcf increase in our east texas production  partially offset by declines in production from our permian and gulf coast properties 
our net production from the fayetteville shale play was bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were up to bcf in and up to bcf in  compared to the prior years 
sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings 
intersegment sales to awg increased slightly to bcf in and decreased to bcf in future increases in demand for our gas production are expected to come from sales to unaffiliated purchasers 
we are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas  including weather related changes affecting demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production 
we are targeting gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of to over our production 
our production volumes could also be impacted by the anticipated sale of certain e p assets 
based on early production histories and modeling and assuming continued positive results  approximately to bcf of our targeted gas production is projected to come from our activities in the fayetteville shale play 
although we expect production volumes in to increase  we cannot guarantee our success in discovering  developing  and producing reserves  including with respect to our fayetteville shale play 
our ability to discover  develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the availability of capital  the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition 
there are also many risks inherent to the discovery  development and production of natural gas and oil 
we refer you to risk factors in item a of part i of this form k for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations 
commodity prices we periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations  including fluctuations in locational market differentials we refer you to item a of this form k and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the average price realized for our gas production  including the effects of hedges  increased to per mcf in and increased slightly to per mcf in the changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities 
our hedging activities increased the average gas price per mcf in  compared to an increase of per mcf in and a reduction of per mcf in in recent years  locational differen ces in market prices for natural gas have been wider than historically experienced 
disregarding the impact of hedges  historically the average price received for our gas production was approximately to per mcf lower than average nymex spot market prices due to the locational market differentials 
however  during  and  widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price received for our gas production to be approximately to per mcf lower than spot market prices 
assuming a nymex commodity price for of per mcf of gas  our differential for the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately to per mcf below the nymex henry hub index price  including the impact of our basis hedges 
as of december   we have financially protected future gas production volumes of bcf in and bcf in from the impact of widening basis differentials through our hedging activities and sales ar rangements 
in addition to the basis hedges discussed above  at december   we had nymex commodity price hedges in place on bcf of and bcf of expected future gas production 
subsequent to december  and prior to february   we hedged bcf of  bcf of and bcf of gas production under fixed price swaps with average prices of  and per mcf  respectively 
in addition  we hedged bcf of and bcf of gas production using costless collars 
the collars relating to production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of and per mcf  respectively  and the collars relating to production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of and per mcf  respectively 
we have also basis protected an additional bcf of gas production with an average differential price of below nymex spot rates 
as of february   we have hedged approximately of our anticipated gas production 
swn 
table of contents we realized an average price of per barrel for our oil production for the year ended december   up approximately from the prior year 
we did not hedge any of our oil production 
the realized average price of per barrel  including the effects of hedges  was up from the average prices we received for our oil production in and were reduced by and per barrel  respectively  due to the effects of our hedging activities 
assuming a nymex commodity price of per barrel of oil for  we expect the average price received for our oil production during to be approximately per barrel lower than average spot market prices as market differentials reduce the average prices received 
operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for the e p segment were in  compared to in and in lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in and due primarily to increases in our gathering and compression costs related to our operations in the fayetteville shale play 
we expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between and per mcfe in primarily due to increased production volumes from the fayetteville shale play 
general and administrative expenses for the e p segment were per mcfe in  down from per mcfe in and up from per mcfe in the decrease in general and administrative costs per mcfe in as compared to was due to the effects of our increased production volumes 
in total  general and administrative expenses for the e p segment were million in  million in and million in the increases in total general and administrative costs since were due primarily to increased payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of our e p operations due to the fayetteville shale play and to increased incentive compensation costs 
we added new employees during  most of which were hired in our e p segment  compared to employees added in we expect our cost per unit for general and administrative expenses to continue to decline in and range between and per mcfe 
the expected decrease in per unit costs in is due to increased production volumes from our fayetteville shale play and a reduced rate of expansion in our e p workforce 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense  stock based compensation expensing under statement on financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment fas r and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
for eligible employees  a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results  including production  proved reserve additions  present value added for each dollar of capital invested  and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production  while another portion is discretionary based upon an employee s performance 
additional discretionary awards may also be awarded under the incentive compensation plan 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion of pension expense 
our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  per mcfe for and per mcfe for the amortization rate is impacted by timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions  revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance  write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests  proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization 
we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above  as well as other factors  including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our fayetteville shale play 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were million at the end of  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the increase in unevaluated costs since december   resulted primarily from an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage and seismic costs for our fayetteville shale play and the related increased drilling activity 
taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in  in and in  and vary from year to year due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that primarily result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices 
additionally  we accrued million in for severance tax refunds related to our east texas production 
the timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to our fayetteville shale play could have a material impact on our per unit costs  if production or reserves additions are lower than projected  our per unit costs would increase 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test swn 
table of contents that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
however  commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at dece mber   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials 
cash flow hedges of gas production in place at december  increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately million net of tax 
we had approximately bcf of future gas production hedged at december  at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  and at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil 
decreases in market prices from december  levels  as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization  future d evelopment costs  and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments 
inflation impacts our e p operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on our operations prior to were minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  since  as commodity prices have increased  the impact of inflation has intensified in our e p segment as shortages in drilling rigs  third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry 
we have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies 
during  our e p operations experienced decreases in certain costs and third party services primarily due to increased vendor competition in our fayetteville shale operating area 
midstream services year ended december  in millions  except volumes revenues marketing revenues gathering gas purchases marketing operating costs and expenses operating income gas volumes marketed bcf gas volumes gathered bcf revenues from our midstream services segment were up in and up in  as compared to prior years 
the increases in revenues in and resulted from increases in volumes marketed and increased gathering revenues  primarily relating to the fayetteville shale play 
increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expenses 
midstream services had gathering revenues of million in related to its gathering systems in arkansas  compared to million in gathering volumes  revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow at a fast pace as reserves related to our fayetteville shale play are developed and production increases 
operating income from our midstream services segment increased in as a result of the increases in gathering revenues and marketing margins  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
operating income from our midstream services segment decreased in due to increased operating costs and expenses that resulted from increased staffing and other costs associated with our growing gathering activities 
the margin generated from natural gas marketing activities was up in and up in from the prior years 
margins fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities 
the increase in volumes marketed in and resulted from marketing our increased production volumes  primarily related to our fayetteville shale play  and volumes for third parties in areas where we have production 
of the total volumes marketed  production from our e p subsidiaries accounted for in  in and in we enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

table of contents in  our midstream services unit entered into a three year firm transportation agreement with ozark gas transmission system to transport volumes increasing to  mmbtu per day in the later stages of the contract 
additionally  in january we entered into a separate two year firm transportation agreement with ozark gas transmission system to transport volumes of  mmbtu per day 
in  one of our midstream services subsidiaries entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which it will contract for firm gas transportation services on two newly proposed pipeline laterals and related facilities of texas gas transmission  llc texas gas  a subsidiary of boardwalk pipeline partners  lp

natural gas distribution year ended december  in thousands except for per mcf amounts revenues gas purchases operating costs and expenses operating income sales and end use transportation deliveries bcf sales customers at year end average sales rate per mcf heating weather degree days percent of normal on november   we entered a definitive agreement for the sale of all capital stock of our utility subsidiary  awg  to sourcegas llc for million plus working capital 
the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by mid year the assets and liabilities associated with awg have been reclassified as held for sale as of december  and upon the consummation of the sale  we will cease to have any natural gas distribution operations 
revenues and operating income gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes 
because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs  the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected operating income 
revenues for increased to million compared to the prior year and revenues for decreased to million compared to the prior year 
the increase in gas distribution revenues was due to an increase in volumes delivered and a rate increase implemented in august the decrease in gas distribution revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather  partially offset by a rate increase implemented in october operating income for our natural gas distribution segment increased in compared to the prior year and decreased in compared to the prior year 
the increase in operating income resulted primarily from the increase in revenues and decreased operating costs and expenses

awg has a transportation contract with ozark gas transmission system for approximately  mmbtu per day of firm capacity that expires in deliveries are made by the pipeline to portions of awg s distribution systems and to the interstate pipelines with which it interconnects 
operating costs and expenses the changes in purchased gas costs for the natural gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased  prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts base load  swing and no notice 
operating costs and expenses  net of purchased gas costs  decreased in to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses that resulted from a decrease in corporate expenses allocated to the natural gas distribution segment 
operating costs and expenses for increased to million from million in primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses that resulted from increased salaries and incentive compensation costs 
inflation impacts our natural gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
additionally  delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our natural gas distribution segment 
although general rates of inflation have been relatively low in recent years  the effects of inflation on the utility s operations may be intensified by higher inflation rates related to certain items such as steel  fuel  right of way acquisition costs and qualified labor 
regulatory matters awg s rates and operations are regulated by the apsc and it operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law 
these franchises  however  may not be exclusive within a geographic area 
although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the ferc  its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the ferc s regulations concerning open access transportation 
on january   the apsc initiated a notice of inquiry regarding a rulemaking for developing and implementing energy efficiency programs 
following a collaborative process  the apsc issued energy efficiency rules on january  these rules require all gas and electric utilities  excluding electric cooperatives  to file energy efficiency plans and programs with the apsc 
awg has filed and received approval for its initial energy efficiency plan  and is in the process of implementing quick start programs 
comprehensive programs are to be implemented in awg will recover the costs of these programs from its customers 
in awg s most recent rate case  the apsc approved a billing determinant adjustment mechanism to mitigate the effects of lost revenues associated with energy efficiency programs 
on december   the apsc issued affiliate transactions rules 
in january  awg and other utilities requested a rehearing of these rules 
on february   the apsc issued an order granting rehearing and staying the implementation of the affiliate transaction rules pending further review 
the apsc subsequently revised the rules to address concerns expressed by the parties to the rulemaking proceeding 
awg has filed affiliate transactions compliance procedures required by the rules  and we do not expect the final rules to have a material effect on its operations 
in july  the apsc approved a rate increase for our utility segment totaling million annually  exclusive of costs to be recovered through the utility s purchase gas adjustment clause

liquidity and capital resources we depend primarily on internally generated funds  our unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below under financing requirements and funds accessed through debt and equity markets as our primary sources of liquidity 
we may borrow up to billion under our revolving credit facility from time to time 
the amount available under our revolving credit facility may be increased up to billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
during  we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our credit facility to fund our planned capital investments discussed below under capital investments  which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations 
on january   we consummated a private placement offering of million of senior notes due discussed below under financing requirements 
net proceeds of approximately million from the offering were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
on january   we entered into a million short term line of credit which was cancelled subsequent to the million private placement offering 
as of february   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in  compared to a increase in to million 
the primary components of cash generated from operations are net income  depreciation  depletion and amortization  the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash from operating activities increased in and due mainly to increased net income  adjusted for non cash expenses 
for  requirements for our capital investments were met primarily by our revolving credit facility and cash provided by operating activities 
net cash from operating activities provided of our cash requirements for capital investments in  in and in at december   our capital structure consisted of debt and equity 
we believe that our operating cash flow  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the expected proceeds from the sale of awg and certain e p asset divestitures will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for swn 
table of contents our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production 
the price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations 
as a result  we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations 
we adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow 
capital investments our capital investments increased to billion in and increased in to million 
capital investments include a reduction of million in and increases of million and million for and  respectively  related to the change in accrued expenditures between years 
our e p segment investments in were billion  up from million in capital investments for and included million and million  respectively  for drilling rigs and related equipment which were subsequently sold and leased back in december in thousands exploration and production exploration and development drilling rigs and related equipment midstream services natural gas distribution other our capital investments for are planned to be billion  consisting of billion for e p  million for midstream services and million for natural gas distribution improvements and general purposes 
we expect to allocate approximately billion of our e p capital to our fayetteville shale play  up from approximately million in our planned level of capital investments in will allow us to accelerate our drilling activity in the fayetteville shale  continue the development of our properties in east texas  continue our conventional drilling in the arkoma basin  maintain our present markets  explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties  generate new drilling prospects  and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our natural gas distribution segment through the closing date of the pending sale

we may adjust the level of capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
financing requirements our total debt outstanding was million at december   and million at december  on october   we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility to  among other things  increase the current borrowing capacity to billion 
pursuant to the amendment  the amount available under the revolving credit facility may be increased to billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
as discussed more fully below  in january  we issued million of senior notes due  the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  the interest rate on the credit facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently basis points over libor 
the revolving credit facility is currently guaranteed by our subsidiaries  southwestern energy production company  seeco  inc and southwestern energy services company and requires additional subsidiary guarantors if certain guaranty coverage levels are not satisfied 
our publicly traded notes were downgraded on august  by standard and poor s to bb with a stable outlook from bbb with a negative outlook 
we have a corporate family rating of ba by moody s 
our senior notes were rated bb by standard and poor s and ba by moody s 
any future downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the credit facility

table of contents our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us 
under the credit agreement  we may not issue total debt in excess of of our total capital  must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity and must maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of or above 
additionally  there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreement at december  although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants  our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil 
if we are unable to borrow under our credit facility  we would have to decrease our capital investment plans 
on january   we issued million of senior notes due in a private placement 
the notes are redeemable at our election  in whole or in part  at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed then outstanding  and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed as determined in accordance with the indenture  plus basis points 
any redemption is also subject to payment of accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
in addition  if we undergo a change of control as defined in the indenture  holders of the senior notes will have the option to require us to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the change of control d ate 
the senior notes are currently guaranteed by our subsidiaries  seeco  inc  southwestern energy production company and southwestern energy services company  which guarantees may be unconditionally released in certain circumstances 
the indentures governing the senior notes and our other existing notes contain covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of us and or our subsidiaries to incur liens  to engage in sale and leaseback transactions and to merge  consolidate or sell assets

the amount recorded for fas is based on current market values of our hedges at december   and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges ultimately are settled  nor does it take into account revenues to be received associat ed with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged 
our credit facility s financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from fas and fas and the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs 
our capital structure at december   would remain at debt and equity without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive gains and losses related to fas and fas as part of our strategy to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations  we have hedged approximately of our expected gas production 
the amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices  our capital investment plans and the actual proceeds from the sale of our utility or any e p asset divestitures 
if commodity prices remain at or near their current levels throughout  assuming that we do not complete the sale of awg or the divestitures of any e p assets  our long term debt would significantly increase in if commodity prices significantly decrease  we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital investments 
off balance sheet arrangements in december  we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction pursuant to which we sold operating drilling rigs  two rigs yet to be delivered and related equipment and then leased such drilling rigs and equipment for an initial term of eight years commencing january   with aggregate annual rental payments of approximately million 
subject to certain conditions  we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors at the end of the th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for the then fair market value 
additionally  we have the option to renew each lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market rental value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal

contingent liabilities and commitments we have the following commitments and contingencies that could create liabilities for us or increase or accelerate our contingent liabilities 
substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our return on the assets of these plans  when combined with other factors including an increase in employees  resulted in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for  and at december   we recognized a liability of million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  compared to a liability of million at december  as a result of actuarial data  and assuming the closing of the sale of awg by mid year  we expect to record expenses of million for these plans in see note to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies below for additional information

table of contents in  our midstream services segment entered into a three year firm transportation agreement with ozark gas transmission system to transport volumes increasing to  mmbtu per day in the latter stage of the contract 
additionally  in january  our midstream services segment entered into a separate two year firm transportation agreement with ozark gas transmission system to transport volumes of  mmbtu per day 
in december  one of our midstream services subsidiaries entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which we will contract for firm gas transportation services on two newly proposed pipeline laterals and related facilities of texas gas transmission  llc texas gas  a subsidiary of boardwalk pipeline partners  lp 
we will be a foundation shipper for the project and will use the proposed laterals and related facilities primarily to deliver gas volumes produced from southwestern s operations in its fayetteville shale play in central arkansas 
depending on regulatory approvals  the expected in service date for both laterals is january  the first lateral line fayetteville lateral will originate in conway county  arkansas  and connect to texas gas mainline system in coahoma county  mississippi 
the fayetteville lateral will be a minimum of in diameter and would have an estimated ultimate capacity of up to b cf per day 
the second lateral greenville lateral will originate at the texas gas mainline system near greenville  mississippi  and extend eastward to interconnect with various interstate pipelines 
the firm transportation agreements entered into by us pursuant to the precedent agreement will have an initial term of ten years and  over time  will enable us to transport up to  mmbtu per day on the fayetteville lateral and up to  mmbtu per day on the greenville lateral 
we will also have the option to acquire up to  mmbtu per day of additional capacity on the fayetteville lateral and up to  mmbtu per day of additional capacity on the greenville lateral 
upon execution and delivery of the firm transportation agreements contemplated by the precedent agreement  our midstream services segment would have additional demand charges of million that would be payable over the ten year term of the agreements 
we are subject to litigation and claims including with respect to environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes  individually or in aggregate  such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations  but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view may change in the future 
if an unfavorable final outcome were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable 
working capital we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our revolving credit facility described above 
we had negative working capital of million at the end of and negative working capital of million at the end of current assets at december   increased million  compared to current assets at december   due to increases in accounts receivable related to gas marketing sales and sales of oil and gas production  partially offset by a million decrease in cash equivalents 
current liabilities increased million at december   due primarily to an increase in accounts payable related to our level of drilling activity  partially offset by a decrease in our current hedging liability 
critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost c ompanies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
however  commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials 
cash flow hedges of gas production in place at december   increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately million net of tax 
we had approximately bcf of future gas production hedged at december  at december   swn 
table of contents the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  and at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil 
decreases in market prices from december  levels  as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization  future development costs  and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules  our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 
natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management 
reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located 
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and the president of our e p subsidiaries 
final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our board of directors 
in each of the past three years  performance revisions to our proved reserve estimates rep resented no greater than of our total proved reserve estimates  which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls 
proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process  when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves  as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties 
proved developed reserves account for of our total reserve base at december  assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natura l gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control 
we refer you to although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited  our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate 
in item a  risk factors  of part i of this form k for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties  risks and other factors 
we engage the services of netherland  sewell associates  inc  an independent petroleum engineering firm  or nsa  to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers 
netherland  sewell associates  inc reports the results of the reserves audit to our board of directors 
in conducting its audit  the engineers and geologists of netherland  sewell associates study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates 
nsa s audit consists primarily of substantive testing  which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately of present worth of the company s total proved reserves 
nsa s audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than of the present worth of our reserves 
the properties in the botto m of the total present worth are the lowest value properties and are not reviewed in the audit 
the fields included in approximately the top present value as of december   accounted for approximately of our total proved reserves and approximately of our proved undeveloped reserves 
in the conduct of its audit  nsa did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests  oil and gas production  well test data  historical costs of operation and development  product prices  or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production 
nsa has advised us that if  in the course of its audit  something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data  nsa did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data 
for the year ended december   netherland  sewell associates issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates  stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are  in the aggregate  reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 
a decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported 
our reserve base is natural gas  therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities 
reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at december   were  million and  bcfe 
an assumed swn 
table of contents decrease of per mcf in the december  gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate million decline in our future cash flows discounted at  adjusted for the effects of commodity hedges  and an approximate decrease of bcfe of our reported reserves 
the decline in reserve quantities  assuming this decrease in gas price  would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool 
the unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates and capitalized costs 
hedging we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability 
in recent years  we have hedged to of our annual production 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are accounted for under fas  as amended by fas and fas  and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
we have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases 
results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense 
any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in ear nings 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges 
future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we did not enter into any interest rate swaps in  or we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
regulated utility operations our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the apsc 
allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations 
such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates 
during the ratemaking process  the apsc may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred 
this allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery 
this causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates 
the apsc has not required any unbundling of services  although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply 
there are no pending regulations relating to unbundling of services  however  should such regulation be proposed and adopted  certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and  accordingly  a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs could be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
for the december   benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in  the discount rate assumed is 
for the periodic benefit cost  the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in swn 
table of contents using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded pension expense of million in  million in and million in related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
at december   we recognized a liability of million  compared to million at december   related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
during  we also funded million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in  we expect to fund million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of million and a postretirement benefit expense of million  assuming the sale of the natural gas distribution segment closes mid year 
assuming a change in the rates lower discount rate and lower rate of return  we would have recorded pension expense of million in gas in underground storage we record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the e p segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
gas expected to be cycled within the next months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset 
the quantity and average cost of gas in storage was bcf at per mcf at december   compared to bcf at per mcf at december  the gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments  including delivery to customers of awg  especially during periods of colder weather 
as a result  demand fees paid by awg to our e p subsidiaries  which are passed through to the utility s customers  are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory 
a significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our gas in storage carrying cost

these risks include  but are not limited to  commodity price volatility  third party interruption of sales to market  inflation  lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling and other operating risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in item a of part i of this form k 
estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this form k are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital investments  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  those estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development investments  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
such variances may be material 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and were proved developed non producing 
proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves  by their nature  are less certain than proved developed producing reserves 
estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion 
production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized  if at all  until sometime in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate disco unt factor for our company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices  basis differentials and interest rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our board of directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks 
these policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
credit risk our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas
