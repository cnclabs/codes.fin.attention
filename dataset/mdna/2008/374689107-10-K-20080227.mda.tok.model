critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts selling  general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  revenue recognition  which impacts net sales  gross margin and net income  the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisition related assets and liabilities  which affects our depreciation and amortization costs  and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets 
management reviews the estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience  current conditions and future expectations 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors  including historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
valuation of inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first in first out basis using either actual costs or a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred products are shipped or service is provided  the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we treat sales returns  allowances and customer incentives as reductions to sales  and we accrue for those items based on historical experience and current estimates of future sales  revising our estimates throughout the year when necessary 
allocation to purchase price of acquired assets and liabilities 
when we acquire a new business  we must allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair market values 
we record any premium over the fair market value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair market value 
the way we characterize the assets has important implications  as long lived assets  for example  are depreciated or amortized  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  as explained below 
with respect to determining the fair market value of assets  the most difficult estimations of individual fair market values are those involving long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair market value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair market value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the estimated fair market value of long lived assets and the significant number of business acquisitions that we have completed  we believe that the recording of acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy 
depreciation  amortization and impairment testing of long lived assets 
we depreciate long lived assets with estimated useful lives over those useful lives 
we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives which consist primarily of acquired customer lists  non competition agreements and unpatented technology over those estimated useful lives 
the specific lives are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceeds their fair market value 
this circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by discounted cash flow method or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
we test goodwill annually for impairment or more often if indicators of impairment exist at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair market value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
a reporting unit is either the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
we have more reporting units than operating segments  and our reporting units may change over time 
the primary valuation method for determining the fair market value of the reporting unit is a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired ie  the fair market value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair market value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  and  if it is less  we then recognize an impairment loss 

table of contents the company tests its indefinite lived assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount 
the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirements are to fund its operations  including working capital  to purchase new facilities and fund improvements to its existing facilities  to purchase new and maintain existing machinery and equipment  and to fund acquisitions 
we regularly consider various strategic business opportunities including acquisitions 
we evaluate such potential acquisitions on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products  operations  or capabilities  as well as provide access to new products  markets and customers 
if we enter into any future acquisition transaction  we may finance that acquisition through a number of sources  including internally available cash resources  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities or any combination of the above 
working capital during  our company s working capital inclusive of the impact of working capital acquired from acquisitions of florence  noll and dramex decreased by approximately million  or  to approximately million at december  from million at december  this decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a decrease in the assets of discontinued operations of million  a decrease of million in inventories and increases in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  a million reduction in accrued expenses and an increase in accounts receivable and other current assets of million 
our working capital also typically undergoes seasonal variations 
our net sales are generally lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter  and we usually begin the fourth quarter with lower inventory and higher accounts payable 
to address these fluctuations  we generally increase working capital in the second and third quarters  and working capital then generally decreases in the fourth quarter 
at december   our working capital was higher than normal due to a reduction in sales during the fourth quarter of that reduced the rate of liquidation of our inventories that we would normally expect 
cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by continuing operations for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to net cash used in continuing operations of approximately million for the year ended december  net cash provided by continuing operations for the year ended december  was primarily the result of decreases in inventories of million  depreciation and amortization of million  income from continuing operations of million  decreases in accounts receivable of million  increases in accounts payable of million and a million increase in deferred taxes  partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million 
net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended december  was primarily the result of increases in inventories of million  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and decreases of deferred taxes of million  partially offset by net income from continuing operations of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and equity in partnerships loss of million

the borrowing in was primarily used to fund acquisitions while the repayments were the result of cash flows from operations 
senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes we and our wholly owned subsidiary gibraltar steel corporation of new york are co borrowers under the second amended and restated credit agreement dated august  with a syndicate of lenders providing for i a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of up to million including a million sub limit for letters of credit and a swing line loan sub limit of million and ii a term loan in the original principal amount of million

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin or the interpretation which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
uncertainty in income taxes  as used in the title of the new interpretation  refers to uncertainty about how some transactions will be treated under the tax law 
this uncertainty leads to questions about whether tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns should be reflected in the financial statements before they are finally resolved with the taxing authorities 
fin applies to all tax positions  regardless of their level of uncertainty or the nature of the position 
however  the interpretation s recognition and measurement requirements are likely to have the most impact on positions for which current or future deductions may be disallowed or reduced in a tax examination 
the interpretation applies to situations where the uncertainty is about the timing of the deduction  the amount of the deduction  or the validity of the deduction 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and we adopted this interpretation during the first quarter of adoption resulted in an increase of  in tax liabilities with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 

table of contents sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
sfas is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect adoption of this standard will have a material impact upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which allows measurement of specified financial instruments  warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in each period 
sfas is effective at the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after november   and will be effective for the company in fiscal we do not expect that adoption of this standard will have a material impact upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r business combinations sfas r  which requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and goodwill acquired in business combinations to be recorded at full fair value 
sfas r also requires that the direct costs of acquisitions be expensed as incurred  and that the estimated fair value of contingent consideration be recorded at the date of purchase  with changes in the estimated fair value recorded in the income statement 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be effective for the company in this standard may be adopted only on a prospective basis and may have a material impact upon our results of operations in periods where we incur direct acquisition costs
