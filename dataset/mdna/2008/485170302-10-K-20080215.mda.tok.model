liquidity and capital resources overview kcs s primary uses of cash are to support operations  maintain and improve its railroad and information systems infrastructure  pay debt service and preferred stock dividends  acquire new and maintain existing locomotives  rolling stock  and other equipment used in the operations of kcs  and meet other obligations 
see cash flow information and contractual obligations below 
as of december   kcs has a debt capitalization ratio total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity of percent 
its primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and access to debt and equity capital markets 
although kcs has had more than adequate access to the capital markets  as a highly leveraged company  the financial terms under which funding is obtained often contain restrictive covenants 
the covenants constrain financial flexibility by restricting or prohibiting certain actions  including the ability to incur additional debt for any purpose other than refinancing existing debt  create or suffer to exist additional liens  make prepayments of particular debt  pay dividends on common stock  make capital investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  issue capital stock  sell certain assets  and engage in mergers and consolidations or in sale leaseback transactions

year end liquidity was reduced by about million related to the acquisition of new locomotives by kcsm 
a portion of the purchase price of these locomotives will be financed with debt in early  increasing available liquidity by about million 
as a result of kcs acquiring a controlling interest in kcsm  kcsm has become subject to the terms and conditions of the indentures governing kcsr s two senior notes issues 
the restrictive covenants of these indentures limit the ability of kcsm to incur additional debt for any purpose other than the refinancing of existing debt and certain new asset financing 
the company believes  based on current expectations  that cash and other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to capital markets  and other available financing resources will be sufficient to fund anticipated operating  capital and debt service requirements and other commitments through however  kcs operating cash flow and financing alternatives can be unexpectedly impacted by various factors  some of which are outside of its control 
for example  if kcs was to experience a substantial reduction in revenues or a substantial increase in operating costs or other liabilities  its operating cash flows could be significantly reduced 
additionally  the company is subject to economic factors surrounding capital markets and its ability 
table of contents to obtain financing under reasonable terms is subject to market conditions 
recent capital market volatility and the tightening of market liquidity could impact kcs access to capital 
further  kcs cost of debt can be impacted by independent rating agencies  which assign debt ratings based on certain credit measurements such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of december   standard poor s rating service s p rated the senior secured debt as bb  the senior unsecured debt as b  and the preferred stock as ccc 
s p also maintained a corporate rating on kcs of b and gave kcs a developing outlook  which the company believes is positive

critical accounting policies and estimates kcs accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to an understanding of kcs historical and future performance 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of kcs board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the selection  application and disclosure of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates 
capitalization and depreciation of property and equipment 
due to the extremely capital intensive nature of the railroad industry  maintenance and depreciation of property and equipment is a substantial operating expense for kcs and the railroad industry as a whole 
kcs capitalizes costs relating to additions and replacements of property and equipment  including certain overhead costs representing the indirect costs associated with capital projects 
overhead factors are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current costs using the full absorption method 
overhead costs are depreciated using the mass asset group method of accounting consistent with industry standards and rules established by the stb 
the cost of property and equipment normally retired  less salvage value  is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating assets using asset group straight line rates 
the stb approves the depreciation rates used by kcsr excluding the amortization of computer software but not for kcsm 
both kcsr and kcsm periodically conduct studies of depreciation rates for property and equipment and implements appropriate changes 
these processes for kcsr and kcsm substantially conform with each other 
these studies take into consideration the historical retirement experience of homogeneous assets within a certain category of group assets eg  ties  rail  box cars  covered hoppers  etc  the current condition of assets  past and current maintenance practices  potential changes in technology and maintenance  estimated salvage value  and industry regulations 
for all other consolidated subsidiaries  depreciation is derived based upon the asset value in excess of estimated salvage value using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation for property and equipment is based upon estimates of the useful lives of assets as well as their net salvage value at the end of their useful lives 
estimation of the useful lives of assets that are long lived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment 
accordingly  management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense are critical 
currently  kcsr and kcsm depreciate property and equipment and capitalized leases generally over a range of to years depending upon the estimated life of the particular asset or asset group 
in addition to the adjustment to rates as a result of the depreciation studies  certain other events could occur that would materially affect the company s estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions regarding kcs ability to realize the return of its investment in operating assets and  therefore  affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both current and future revenues 

table of contents because depreciation expense is a function of statistical studies made of property  plant and equipment  subsequent studies could result in different estimates of useful lives and net salvage values 
if future depreciation studies yield results indicating that the assets have shorter lives as a result of obsolescence  physical condition  changes in technology or changes in net salvage values  the estimate of depreciation expense could increase 
likewise  if future studies indicate that assets have longer lives  the estimate of depreciation expense could decrease 
kcsr depreciation review 
during the year ended december   kcsr engaged a civil engineering firm to assist management in evaluating depreciation rates for property and equipment 
the study centered on evaluating historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and indicated that kcsr was depreciating its property over shorter periods than the assets were actually used 
the effect of this change in estimate was a million decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended december  kcsm depreciation review 
for the year ended december   kcsm adopted the mass asset group depreciation method for consistency with kcsr 
in order to assist management with the change to the group method  kcsm engaged a civil engineering firm to conduct a study of depreciation rates for property and equipment 
the study centered on evaluating historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and indicated that kcsm was depreciating its property over shorter periods than the assets were actually used 
as a result  depreciation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of reflected an adjustment totaling million  to reduce depreciation expense as recorded in the second and third quarter of unlike kcsr  kcsm depreciation rates are not subject to the approval of the stb and the changes to the depreciation rates  as a result of the study  were applied in concession rights and related assets are amortized over the useful lives as determined by the kcsm depreciation study 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million 
a one percent change in the average life of all group assets would result in a million change to the company s depreciation expense 
provision for environmental remediation 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations in the us and mexico 
kcs conducts studies  as well as site surveys  to determine the extent of environmental remediation necessary to clean up a site 
these studies incorporate the analysis of internal and external environmental engineering staff and consultation with legal counsel 
from these studies and surveys  a range of estimates of the costs involved is derived 
these cost estimates are based on forecasts of the total future direct costs related to environmental remediation and change periodically as additional or better information becomes available as to the extent of site remediation required  if any 
kcs accrues for the cost of remediation where the obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
cost estimates can be influenced by advanced technologies related to the detection  appropriate remedial course of action and anticipated cost 
certain changes could occur that would materially affect management s estimates and assumptions related to costs for environmental remediation 
if kcs becomes subject to more stringent environmental remediation costs at known sites  discovers additional contamination  discovers previously unknown sites  or becomes subject to related personal or property damage  kcs could incur additional costs that could be significant in connection with its environmental remediation 
accordingly  management believes that estimates related to the accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to kcs results of operations 
environmental remediation expense was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively and was included in casualties and insurance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
additionally  as of december   kcs had a liability for environmental remediation of million 
kcs environmental liabilities are not discounted 
this amount was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies sfas 
for 
table of contents purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis  if the december  environmental reserve was adjusted increased or decreased by  environmental expense would change by million 
provision for casualty claims 
due to the nature of railroad operations  claims related to personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from crossing collisions and derailments  as well as claims related to personal property damage and other casualties is a substantial expense to kcs 
claims are estimated and recorded for known reported occurrences as well as for incurred but not reported ibnr occurrences 
consistent with the general practice within the railroad industry  the estimated liability for these casualty expenses is actuarially determined on an undiscounted basis 
in estimating the liability for casualty claims  kcs bases the estimate on an updated study of casualty reserves  which calculates an estimate using historical experience and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an estimate of future claim costs 
personal injury and other casualty claims are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty  especially estimates related to incurred but not reported personal injuries for which a party has yet to assert a claim 
in deriving an estimate of the provision for casualty claims  management must make assumptions related to substantially uncertain matters injury severity  claimant age and legal jurisdiction 
changes in the assumptions used for actuarial studies could have a material effect on the estimate of the provision for casualty claims 
the most sensitive assumptions for personal injury accruals are the expected average cost per claim and the projected frequency rates for the number of claims that will ultimately result in payment 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the liability for personal injuries and other casualty claims is critical to kcs results of operations 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
based on the methods described above and information available as of december   the liability for personal injury casualty claims was million 
a increase or decrease in either the expected average cost per claim or the frequency rate for claims with payments would result in an approximate million increase or decrease in the company s recorded personal injury reserves 
for the years ended december  and  casualty expense equaled million and million  respectively  and was included in casualties and insurance expense in the consolidated statements of income 
provision for income taxes 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of kcs 
for financial reporting purposes  management determines the current tax liability  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities  in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred into the future 
currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to kcs us  state and mexican income tax returns for the current year and anticipated tax payments resulting from income tax audits while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance sheet 
the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse 
in addition  the tax provision for mexico is further complicated by the impacts of inflation as well as the exchange rate  both of which can have a significant impact on the calculation 
in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences  management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary 
if the differences are temporary  management must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets of kcs 
accordingly  management believes that the estimate related to the provision for income taxes are critical to the company s results of operations 

table of contents for the year ended december   income tax expense totaled million 
for every change in the effective rate  income tax expense would have changed by million 
for every change in the mexican inflation rate the tax expense would increase or decrease by million 
if the exchange rate used at the end of changed by cents from mexican pesos to each us dollar to pesos per dollar  the tax expense would have decreased by million 
other matters litigation 
the company is a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions  all of which are of an ordinary  routine nature and incidental to its operations 
included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by current and former employees for job related injuries and by third parties for injuries related to railroad operations 
kcs aggressively defends these matters and has established liability reserves that management believes are adequate to cover expected costs 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding  in the opinion of the company s management  other than those proceedings described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  such proceedings and actions should not  individually  or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
inflation 
us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost  which does not reflect the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property 
due to the capital intensive nature of kcs business  the replacement cost of these assets would be significantly larger than the amounts reported under the historical cost basis 
recent accounting pronouncements 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information relative to recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures concerning market risk kcs utilizes various financial instruments that have certain inherent market risks  but these instruments have not been entered into for trading purposes 
the following information  together with information included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to kcs 
interest rate sensitivity 
floating rate indebtedness totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
two credit agreements  each comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility  contain variable rate debt which accrues interest based on target interest indexes london interbank offered rate libor or an alternative base rate plus an applicable spread  as set forth in each credit agreement 
given the balance of million of variable rate debt at december   kcs is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  a hypothetical basis points increase in each of the respective target interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis for the floating rate instruments issued by the company as of december  based upon the borrowing rates available to kcs and its subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of debt was approximately  million at december  and  million at december   compared with a carrying value of  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity 
as described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters derivative instruments of this form k  kcs periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment and swap transactions 
at december   kcs did not have any outstanding fuel swap agreements 
the company also holds fuel inventories for use in operations 
these inventories are not material to kcs overall financial position 
fuel costs are expected to mirror market conditions in  however  fuel cost are unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors outside the company s control 
kcs also cushions the impact of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge 
table of contents revenues from customers 
assuming annual consumption of million gallons  a cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would cause a million change in operating expenses 
foreign exchange sensitivity 
kcsm uses the dollar as its functional currency 
earnings from kcsm included in the company s results of operations reflect revaluation gains and losses that kcsm records in the process of translating certain transactions from pesos to dollars 
therefore  the company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the peso 
while not currently utilizing foreign currency instruments to hedge kcs dollar investment in kcsm  existing alternatives are evaluated as market conditions and exchange rates fluctuate 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the us dollar to the mexican peso exchange rate on net monetary assets of ps  million would result in a translation loss of approximately million and a decrease in the exchange rate would result in a translation gain of approximately million
