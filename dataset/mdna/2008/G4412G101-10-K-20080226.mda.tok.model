we are one of the largest network marketing companies in the world with net sales of approximately billion for the fiscal year ended december  we sell our products in countries through a network of over million independent distributors 
in china  in order to comply with local laws and regulations  we sell our products through retail stores and an employed sales force 
we believe the quality of our products and the effectiveness of our distribution network  coupled with geographic expansion  have been the primary reasons for our success throughout our year operating history 
we offer science based products in four principal categories weight management  targeted nutrition  energy fitness and outer nutrition 
the weight management product portfolio includes meal replacement shakes  weight loss enhancers  appetite suppressors and a variety of healthy snacks 
our collection of targeted nutrition products includes dietary supplements which contain quality herbs  vitamins  minerals and natural ingredients that support total well being and long term good health 
the energy fitness category includes energy and isotonic drinks to support a healthy active lifestyle 
our outer nutrition products include skin cleansers  moisturizers and lotions with antioxidants  as well as anti aging products 
weight management  targeted nutrition  energy fitness and outer nutrition accounted for   and of our net sales in fiscal year  respectively 
we believe that the direct selling channel is ideally suited to marketing our products  because sales of weight management  nutrition and personal care products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact between retail consumers and distributors 
this personal contact may enhance consumers nutritional and health education as well as motivate consumers to begin and maintain wellness and weight management programs 
in addition  many of our distributors use our products themselves  and can therefore provide first hand testimonials of product effectiveness to consumers  which often serve as a powerful sales tool 
we are focused on building and maintaining our distributor network by offering financially rewarding and flexible career opportunities through sales of quality  innovative and efficacious products to health conscious consumers 
we believe the income opportunity provided by our network marketing program appeals to a broad cross section of people throughout the world  particularly those seeking to supplement family income  start a home business or pursue entrepreneurial  full and part time  employment opportunities 
our distributors  who are independent contractors  can profit from selling our products and can also earn royalties and bonuses on sales made by the other distributors whom they recruit to join their sales organizations 
we enable distributors to maximize their potential by providing a broad array of motivational  educational and support services 
we motivate our distributors through our performance based compensation plan  individual recognition  reward programs and promotions  and participation in local  national and international company sponsored sales events such as extravaganzas 
we are committed to providing professionally designed educational training materials that our distributors can use to enhance recruitment and maximize their sales 
we and our distributor leadership conduct thousands of training sessions each year throughout the world to educate and motivate our distributors 
these training events teach our distributors not only how to develop invaluable business building and leadership skills  but also how to differentiate our products to consumers 
our corporate sponsored training events provide a forum for distributors  who otherwise operate independently  to share ideas with us and each other 
in addition  we operate an internet based herbalife broadcasting network  which delivers worldwide  educational  motivational and inspirational content  including addresses from our chief executive officer  to our distributors 
our efficient and effective distribution  logistics and customer care support system assists our distributors by providing same day  or next day sales capabilities and support services 
we further aid our distributors by generating additional demand for our products through traditional marketing and public relations activities  such as television ads  sporting event sponsorships and endorsements 

table of contents our competitive strengths we believe that our success stems from our ability to motivate our distributor network with a range of quality  innovative and efficacious products that appeal to consumer preferences for healthy living 
we have been able to achieve sustained and profitable growth by capitalizing on the following competitive strengths distributor base as of december  we had over million distributors  which includes approximately  china sales representatives and employees 
collectively we refer to this group as distributors 
approximately  of our million distributors have become sales leaders  which are comprised of approximately  supervisors in the countries where we use our traditional marketing plan and  china sales employees operating under our china marketing plan 
collectively we refer to this group as sales leaders 
we believe that the distributors who have not attained supervisor level can be segmented into three general categories based on their product order patterns discount buyers  small retailers and potential supervisors 
we define discount buyers as customers who have signed up as distributors to enjoy a discount on their purchases  small retailers as product users and sales people who generate modest sales to friends and family  and potential supervisors as distributors who are proactively developing a business with the intention of qualifying to become a supervisor 
in  excluding china  distributor orders for these three general categories were approximately  and  respectively 
for the approximately  supervisors in our organization  the marketing plan encourages active participation in the business including building down line sales organizations of their own  which can serve to increase their income and increase our product sales 
sales leaders contribute significantly to our sales 
product portfolio we are committed to building distributor  customer and brand loyalty by providing a diverse portfolio of health oriented and wellness products 
the breadth of our product offerings enables our distributors to sell a comprehensive package of products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition 
many of our product formulations have been in existence for years  however  we continually review  and if necessary  improve our product formulations  based upon developments in nutrition science 
we believe that the longevity and variety in our product portfolio significantly enhance our distributors abilities to build their businesses 
nutrition science based product development we continue to emphasize and make investments in science based product development in the fields of weight management  nutrition and personal care 
we have a growing internal team of scientists dedicated to continually evaluating opportunities to enhance our existing products and to develop new science based products 
these product development efforts are reviewed by prominent doctors and world renowned scientists who constitute our scientific advisory board and nutrition advisory board 
in addition  we have provided donations to assist in the establishment of the mark hughes cellular and molecular lab at ucla  or the ucla lab  and we continue to rely on their expertise 
we believe that the ucla lab provides opportunities for herbalife to access cutting edge science in herbal research and nutrition 
in  herbalife awarded a research grant to the national center for natural products research at the university of mississippi school of pharmacy  or ncnpr 
the grant will allow ncnpr scientists to identify and study the biologically active chemicals found in botanicals  which may be used in the development of future dietary supplements and skin care products for herbalife 
scalable business model our business model enables us to grow our business with only moderate investment in our infrastructure and other fixed costs 
with the exception of our china business  we require no company employed sales force to market and sell our products 
we incur no direct incremental cost to add a new distributor in our existing markets  and our distributor compensation varies directly with sales 
in addition  our distributors bear the majority of our consumer marketing expenses  and supervisors sponsor and coordinate a large share of distributor recruiting and training initiatives 
furthermore  we can readily increase production and distribution of our products as a result of our numerous third party manufacturing relationships as well as our global footprint of in house distribution centers 

table of contents geographic diversification we have a proven ability to establish our network marketing organization in new markets 
since our founding years ago  we have expanded our presence into countries 
while sales within our local markets may fluctuate due to economic  market and regulatory conditions  competitive pressures  political and social instability or for company specific reasons  we believe that our geographic diversity mitigates our financial exposure to any particular market 
experienced management team our management team is led by michael o 
johnson who became our chief executive officer after spending years with the walt disney company  where he most recently served as president of walt disney international 
in  he was named chairman

to address this opportunity  we have assembled a management team with direct selling experience  secured a headquarters location in shanghai  expanded our manufacturing capacity in our suzhou  china factory and in july  received a direct selling license for the jiangsu province 
we are in the process of opening retail locations and pursuing direct selling licenses in additional provinces

we are establishing a core set of products that will be available in all markets around the world 
we are also empowering regional and country managers to develop unique products that are specific to their markets to ensure that local consumer needs can be met 
additionally  each year we plan to have mega launches of products and or programs to generate continual excitement among our distributors  to add to our core set of products and to support our distributor dmos 
these mega launches will generally target specific market segments deemed strategic to us  such as the introduction of a children s line to target stay at home moms and a sports and fitness line to target consumers with active lifestyles 

table of contents distributor strategy we continue to increase our investment in events and promotions as a catalyst to help our distributors improve the effectiveness and productivity of their businesses 
we will attempt to globalize best practice business methods to enable our distributors to improve their penetration in existing markets

as of december   we marketed and sold products encompassing over  skus through our distributors and had approximately  trademarks worldwide 
we group our products into four primary categories weight management  targeted nutrition  energy fitness and outer nutrition 
our products are often sold in programs  which are comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for our consumers and maximize our distributors cross selling opportunities 
these programs target specific consumer market segments  such as women  men or children  as well as weight management customers and individuals looking to enhance their overall well being 
the following table summarizes our products by product category

in  we introduced bizworks  a customizable retail website for our distributors to enhance the on line experience and improve their productivity 
product development we are committed to providing our distributors with unique  innovative science based products to help them increase recruitment  retention and retailing 
we believe this can be best accomplished in part by introducing new products and by upgrading  reformulating and repackaging existing product lines 
our internal team of scientists and product developers collaborate with the company s nutrition advisory board and scientific advisory board to formulate  review and evaluate new product ideas 
once a particular market opportunity has been identified  our 
table of contents scientists along with our marketing and sales teams work closely with distributors to effect a successful development and launch of the product 
a new product development process was implemented globally to accelerate the introduction of new products and to improve the launch of products 
cross functional teams from product marketing  product development  sciences  licensing  manufacturing and finance were formed and assigned to major product initiatives 
the product development process is a stage gate process based on best in class practices in our industry 
the process consists of five stages identification  feasibility assessment  development  launch and learn 
the project teams obtain approvals from a corporate steering team comprised of key executives in the company 
the process defines each department s roles and responsibilities and sets clear deliverables for each stage 
it creates a succinct process from the beginning of the development cycle to the end 
new product ideas are generated and narrowed down to high potential ideas that fill our business needs and conform to our overall strategy 
we test the most promising ideas with distributors and customers using a variety of qualitative and quantitative tools 
this testing is followed by a feasibility assessment which includes a review of product and package prototypes  product positioning and messaging  process design  analysis of manufacturing issues and providing preliminary financial projections of product sales 
the next stage is the development phase in which we finalize the formula  process  manufacturing strategy  product positioning  pricing  labeling and other related matters 
the fourth stage is the launch phase in which we prepare promotional and sales materials  complete the supply chain plan  create product and financial forecasts  and complete other final preparations for launch 
after the product is launched  we closely track sales performance and the lessons learned so we can update and improve the product development process 
in addition  during the past three years  we have significantly increased our investment in clinical studies and in our science program to substantiate claims and efficacy of our products 
we reorganized our technical team in for greater efficiency in product development as well as to carry out related product development strategies both globally and regionally 
during  we also added new talents to our technical and scientific teams and additional resources to the company s nutrition and scientific advisory boards 
the nutrition advisory board is headed by david heber  md  md  professor of medicine and public health at the ucla school of medicine  director of the ucla center for human nutrition and director of the ucla center for dietary supplement research in botanicals 
the nutrition advisory board has members from countries 
it is comprised of leading scientists and medical doctors who provide training on product usage and give health news updates through herbalife literature  the internet and training events around the world 
our scientific advisory board is chaired by dr 
heber and has members from six countries 
louis ignarro  phd  distinguished professor of pharmacology at the ucla school of medicine and nobel laureate in medicine is also a member of the scientific advisory board 
we believe that it is important to maintain our relationships with members of our nutrition advisory board and scientific advisory board to recognize the time and effort that they expend on our behalf 
each member of our nutrition advisory board other than dr 
heber receives a monthly retainer of up to  plus up to  for every day that they appear at a non southern california distributor event and up to  for every day that they need to travel to such events 
members of our scientific advisory board are compensated for their time and efforts in the following manner ten members are paid an annual retainer of  plus travel expenses  dr 
ignarro receives no direct compensation from us although we do pay a consulting firm  with which dr 
ignarro is affiliated  a royalty on sales of niteworks  certain healthy heart products  and other products that we may mutually designate in the future that are  in each case  sold with the aid of dr 
ignarro s consulting  promotional or endorsement services  with such amounts totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively and dr 
heber generally  other than a one time option grant in  receives no direct compensation from us although we do reimburse him for travel expenses and we do pay to a consulting firm  with which dr 
heber is affiliated  a quarterly consulting fee of  in  we completed construction and moved into modern  state of the art product development laboratories in torrance  california  as well as quality control laboratories in carson  california 
this investment will enable our developers  scientists and quality control staff to accelerate product development  launch products faster and provide a more robust quality control program 

table of contents herbalife also made further contributions to the ucla lab 
we have continually invested in this lab since with total donations of approximately million which includes donations of lab equipment and software 
ucla agreed that the donations would be used for further research and education in the fields of weight management and botanical dietary supplements 
in addition  we have made donations from time to time to ucla to fund research and educational programs 
while our direct relationship with ucla is currently limited to conducting one ongoing clinical studies  we intend to take full advantage of the expertise at ucla by committing to support research that will further our understanding of the benefits of phytochemicals 
in  we introduced new flavors of formula including caf latte and pina colada  as well as protein bars deluxe and formula in single serve sachets for weight management  kids shakes and kids multi vitamins for targeted nutrition  h o tm fitness drink for energy and fitness and skin activator packettes and soft green line for outer nutrition 
we believe our focus on nutrition and botanical science and our efforts at combining our internal research and development efforts with the scientific expertise of our scientific advisory board  the educational skills of the nutrition advisory board and the resources of the ucla lab should result in meaningful product introductions and give our distributors and consumers increased confidence in our products 
network marketing program general our products are distributed through a global network marketing organization comprised of over million independent distributors in countries  including in china where  due to regulations  our sales are conducted through company operated retail stores  sales representatives and employed sales management personnel 
in china  in the areas where we have a direct selling license  our distributors and employees can sell herbalife product outside the retail establishments 
in addition to helping our distributors achieve physical health and wellness through use of our products  we offer our distributors  who are independent contractors  attractive income opportunities 
distributors may earn income on their own sales and can also earn royalties and bonuses on sales made by the distributors in their sales organizations 
we believe that our products are particularly well suited to the network marketing distribution channel because sales of weight management and health and wellness products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact and coaching between retail consumers and distributors 
we believe our continued commitment to developing innovative  science based products will enhance our ability to attract new distributors as well as increase the productivity and retention of existing distributors 
furthermore  our international sponsorship program  which permits distributors to sponsor distributors in other countries where we are licensed to do business and where we have obtained required product approvals  provides a significant advantage to our distributors in developing and growing their businesses 
china has its own unique marketing program 
on july   we entered into an agreement with our distributors that no material changes adverse to the distributors will be made to the existing marketing plan without their consent and that we will continue to distribute herbalife products exclusively through our independent distributors 
we believe that this agreement has strengthened our relationship with our existing distributors  improved our ability to recruit new distributors and generally increased the long term stability of our business 
structure of the network marketing program to become a distributor in most markets  a person must be sponsored by an existing distributor and must purchase an international business pack 
the international business pack is a distributor kit available in local languages 
the product and literature contents in the kits vary slightly to meet individual market needs 
an example is the large size us ibp  which costs and includes a canister of formula shake mix  several bottles of different nutritional supplements  herbal concentrate tea  liftoff an energy drink  and nourifusion skin care samples  along with a handy tote  booklets describing us  our compensation plan and rules of conduct  various training and promotional materials  distributor applications and a product catalog 
the smaller us version costs and includes sample products  a handy tote  and essentially the same print and promotional materials as included in the larger kit version 
to become a supervisor or qualify for a higher level  distributors must achieve specified volumes of product sales or earn certain amounts of royalty overrides during specified time periods and 
table of contents must re qualify for the levels once each year 
to attain supervisor status  a distributor generally must be responsible for sales of products representing at least  volume points in one month or  volume points in two consecutive months 
china has its own unique marketing program 
volume points are point values assigned to each of our products that are usually equal in all countries and are based on the suggested retail price of us products one volume point equates to one us dollar 
supervisors may then attain higher levels  consisting of the world team  the global expansion team  the millionaire team  the president s team  the chairman s club and the founders circle and earn increasing amounts of royalty overrides based on sales in their downline organizations and  for members of our global expansion team and above  earn production bonuses on sales in their downline organizations 
the following table sets forth the number of our sales leaders and supervisor retention rates as of requalification period at the end of february number of sales leaders supervisors retention rate north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific excluding china total supervisors china sales employees worldwide total sales leaders in february of each year  we remove from the rank of supervisor those individuals who did not satisfy the supervisor qualification requirements during the preceding twelve months 
distributors who meet the supervisor requirements at any time during the year are promoted to supervisor status at that time  including any supervisors who were removed  but who subsequently requalified 
for the latest twelve month re qualification period ending january  approximately of our supervisors re qualified 
typically  distributors who purchase our product for personal consumption or for short term weight loss or income goals may stay with us for several months to one year while supervisors who have committed time and effort to build a sales organization generally stay for longer periods 
we rely on certifications from the selling distributors as to the amount and source of product sales to other distributors which are not directly verifiable by us 
for supervisors to requalify and retain their distributor organization and associated earnings  they need to earn  volume points in one month or  volume points in each of two consecutive months 
in order to increase retailing of our products  we have modified our requalification criteria to provide that any distributor that earns at least  volume points in any month period can requalify as a supervisor and retain a discount of from suggested retail prices  but will forfeit their distributor organization and associated earnings 
distributor earnings distributor earnings are derived from several sources 
first  distributors may earn profits by purchasing our products at wholesale prices  which are discounted to from suggested retail prices  depending on the distributors level within our distributor network  and selling our products to retail customers or to other distributors 
second  distributors who sponsor other distributors and establish their own sales organizations may earn royalty overrides  up to of product retail sales in the aggregate  production bonuses  up to of product retail sales in the aggregate and the mark hughes bonus  up to of product retail sales in the aggregate 
royalty overrides and bonuses together with the distributor allowances represent the potential earnings to distributors of up to approximately of retail sales 
each distributor s success is dependent on two primary factors the time  effort and commitment a distributor puts into his or her herbalife business and the product sales made by a distributor and his or her sales organization 

table of contents distributors  with the exception of china  earn the right to receive royalty overrides upon attaining the level of supervisor and above  and production bonuses upon attaining the level of global expansion team and above 
once a distributor becomes a supervisor  he or she has an incentive to qualify  by earning specified amounts of royalty overrides  as a member of the global expansion team  the millionaire team or the president s team  and thereby receive production bonuses of up to 
we believe that the right of distributors to earn royalty overrides and production bonuses contributes significantly to our ability to retain our most productive distributors 
many of our non supervisor distributors join herbalife to obtain a discount on our products and become a discount consumer or merely have a part time income goal in mind 
consequently  non supervisor earnings tend to be relatively low and are not tracked by the company 
under the regulations published by the chinese government  direct selling companies are limited to the payment of gross compensation to direct sellers of up to a maximum of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers 
we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial ongoing additional costs relating to the inclusion in the china business model of company operated retail stores  employed sales management personnel and company provided training and certification procedures for sales personnel  features not common elsewhere in our traditional business model 
distributor motivation and training we believe that motivation and training are key elements in distributor success and that we and our distributor supervisors have established a consistent schedule of events to support these needs 
we and our distributor leadership conduct thousands of training sessions annually on local  regional and global levels to educate and motivate our distributors 
every month  there are hundreds of one day success training seminars held throughout the world 
annually  in each major territory or region  there is a three day world team school that focuses on product and business development and is typically attended by  to  distributors 
additionally  once a year in each region  we host an extravaganza at which our distributors from the region can come to learn about new products  expand their skills and celebrate their success 
in  such events were held in brazil  colombia  the united states  singapore  germany and mexico 
in addition to these training sessions  we have our own herbalife broadcast network that we use to provide distributors continual training and the most current product and marketing information 
the herbalife broadcast network can be seen on the internet 
distributor reward and recognition is a significant factor in motivating our distributors 
in  we invested over million in regional and worldwide events and promotions to motivate our distributors to achieve and exceed both sales and recruiting goals 
examples of our worldwide promotions are the vacations and the active world team promotion 
the vacations offer incentives for distributors to qualify to receive a regional vacation 
the active world team promotion provides cash and recognition incentives to distributors who achieve all three requirements for becoming a world team member and thus have proven themselves adept at building a well balanced business 
geographic presence as of december   we conducted business in countries throughout the world 
the following chart sets forth the countries we currently operate in as of december   organized in the company s five geographic regions  and the year in which we commenced operations 
year country entered north america usa canada jamaica mexico and central america mexico dominican republic

table of contents year country entered norway finland greece turkey botswana lesotho namibia swaziland iceland slovak republic cyprus ireland croatia latvia ukraine estonia lithuania hungary zambia in late  we changed our geographic regions from seven to five regions as part of our on going realignment for growth efforts 
historical information presented below relating to the geographic regions has been reclassified to conform with current geographic presentation 
number of net sales percent of countries year ended december  total net sales december  geographic region in millions north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific worldwide the top six countries have represented approximately  and of net sales in   and  respectively  reflecting our broad geographical diversification 
after entering a new country  in many instances we experience an initial period of rapid growth in sales as new distributors are recruited  that is then followed by a decline in sales 
we believe that a significant factor affecting these markets is the opening of other new markets within the same geographic region or within the same or similar language or cultural bases 
some distributors tend to focus their attention on the business opportunities provided by these newer markets instead of developing their established sales organizations in existing markets 
additionally  in some instances  we have become aware that certain sales in certain existing markets were attributable to purchasers who distributed our products in countries that had not yet been opened 
when these countries were opened  the sales in existing markets shifted to the newly opened markets  resulting in a decline in sales in the existing markets 
to the extent we decide to open new markets in the future  we will continue to seek to minimize the impact on distributor focus in existing markets and to ensure that adequate distributor support services and other herbalife systems are in place to support growth while maintaining prior sales levels within the region

after the products arrive in a foreign market  distributors purchase the products from the local distribution center or the associated sales center 
the products manufactured in europe are shipped to a centralized warehouse facility  from which delivery by truck  ship or plane to other international markets occurs 
product return and buy back policies in most markets  our products include a customer satisfaction guarantee 
under this guarantee any customer who is not satisfied with an herbalife product for any reason may return it or any unused portion of it within days of purchase to their distributor from whom it was purchased for a full refund from the distributor or credit toward the purchase of another herbalife product 
if they return the products to us on a timely basis  the distributor may obtain replacement product from us for such returned products 
in addition  in most jurisdictions  we maintain a buy back program pursuant to which we will repurchase products sold to a distributor provided that the distributor resigns as an herbalife distributor  returns the product in marketable condition generally within twelve months of original purchase and meets certain documentation and other requirements 
we believe this buy back policy addresses a number of the regulatory compliance issues pertaining to network marketing  in that it offers monetary protection to distributors who want to exit the business 
product returns  refunds and buy back expenses were approximately of retail sales in each of the years  and management information  internet and telecommunication systems in order to facilitate our continued growth and support distributor activities  we continually upgrade our management information  internet and telecommunication systems 
these systems include a centralized host computer managed by hewlett packard in colorado  which is linked to our international markets through a dedicated wide area network that provides on line  real time computer connectivity and access and hosts our legacy 
table of contents operating systems and our new oracle platform  local area networks of personal computers within our markets  serving our regional administrative staffs  an international e mail system through which our employees communicate  a standardized northern telecom meridian telecommunication system in most of our markets  and internet websites to provide a variety of online services for distributors such as status of qualifications  meeting announcements  product information  application forms  educational materials and  in the united states  sales ordering capabilities 
these systems are designed to provide  among other things  financial and operating data for management  timely and accurate product ordering  royalty override payment processing  inventory management and detailed distributor records 
we intend to continue to invest in these systems in order to strengthen our operating platform 
regulation general in both our united states and foreign markets  we are affected by extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints 
such laws  regulations and other constraints exist at the federal  state or local levels in the united states and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions  including regulations pertaining to the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products  product claims and advertising  including direct claims and advertising by us  as well as claims and advertising by distributors  for which we may be held responsible  our network marketing program  transfer pricing and similar regulations that affect the level of us and foreign taxable income and customs duties  and taxation of our independent distributors which in some instances may impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes and maintain appropriate records 
products in the united states  the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  storing  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies  including the food and drug administration  or fda  the federal trade commission  or ftc  the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  the united states department of agriculture  or usda  the environmental protection agency  or epa  the united states postal service  united states customs and border protection  and the drug enforcement administration 
our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed and sold 
the fda  in particular  regulates the formulation  manufacture and labeling of over the counter  or otc  drugs  conventional foods  dietary supplements  and cosmetics such as those distributed by us 
fda regulations require us and our suppliers to meet relevant current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  regulations for the preparation  packing and storage of foods and otc drugs 
on june   the fda published its final rule regulating cgmps for dietary supplements 
the final rule became effective august  and large companies such as herbalife will have june to achieve compliance 
we expect to see an increase in certain manufacturing costs as a result of the necessary increase in testing of raw ingredients and finished products and compliance with higher quality standards 
most otc drugs are subject to fda monographs that establish labeling and composition for these products 
those of our products which are classified as otc must comply with these monographs  and our manufacturers must list all products with the fda and follow cgmp 
our cosmetic products are regulated for safety by the fda  which requires that ingredients meet industry standards for non allergenicity and non toxicity 
performance claims for cosmetics may not be therapeutic 
the us dietary supplement health and education act  or dshea  revised the provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or ffdca  concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements and  we believe  is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry 
the legislation created a new statutory class of dietary supplements 
this new class includes vitamins  minerals  herbs  amino acids and other dietary substances for human use to supplement the diet  and the legislation grandfathers  with some limitations  dietary ingredients that were on the market before october  a dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was not on the market before october  will require evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe 
manufacturers or marketers of dietary supplements in 
table of contents the united states and certain other jurisdictions that make product performance claims  including structure or function claims  must have substantiation in their possession that the statements are truthful and not misleading 
the majority of the products marketed by us in the united states are classified as conventional foods or dietary supplements under the ffdca 
internationally  the majority of products marketed by us are classified as foods or food supplements 
in january  the fda issued a regulation that defines the types of statements that can be made concerning the effect of a dietary supplement on the structure or function of the body pursuant to dshea 
under dshea  dietary supplement labeling may bear structure or function claims  which are claims that the products affect the structure or function of the body  without prior fda approval  but with notification to the fda 
they may not bear a claim that they can prevent  treat  cure  mitigate or diagnose disease a disease claim 
the regulation describes how the fda distinguishes disease claims from structure or function claims 
during  the fda issued a guidance  paralleling an earlier guidance from the ftc  defining a manufacturers obligations to substantiate structure function claims 
the fda also issued a structure function claims small entity compliance guide 
in addition  the agency permits companies to use fda approved full and qualified health claims for products containing specific ingredients that meet stated requirements 
as a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other products that are ingested by consumers  we are subject to the risk that one or more of the ingredients in our products may become the subject of regulatory action 
a number of states restricted the sale of dietary supplements containing botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids 
as a result of these state regulations  we stopped sales of dietary supplements containing botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids due to a shift in consumer preference for ephedra free products and a significant increase in products liability insurance premiums for products containing botanical sources of ephedrine group alkaloids 
on december   we ceased sales of thermojetics original green herbal tablets containing ephedrine alkaloids derived from chinese ma huang  as well as thermojetics green herbal tablets and thermojetics gold herbal tablets the latter two containing the herb sida cordifolia which is another botanical source of ephedrine alkaloids 
on february   the fda published a rule finding that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling of the product  or  if no conditions of use are suggested in the labeling  under ordinary conditions of use  and are therefore adulterated 
the fda has on record a small number of reports of adverse reactions allegedly resulting from the ingestion of our thermojetics original green tablet 
these reports are among thousands of reports of adverse reactions to these products sold by other companies 
as a further outgrowth of the fda ephedra safety review  the fda  in january  announced that it would undertake a review of the safety of the herb citrus aurantium 
we had previously used citrus aurantium in the shapeworks total control and thermojetics green ephedra free dietary supplements sold in the united states and in a number of international markets 
unconfirmed reports of serious adverse events  reportedly associated with citrus aurantium  were disclosed by the fda to the new york times during april under the freedom of information act  we obtained a copy of those anecdotal serious adverse event reports 
no herbalife dietary supplement containing citrus aurantium was cited by the fda 
indeed  many cited products from other companies did not even contain citrus aurantium 
nonetheless  we decided to reformulate our products and we no longer market dietary supplements containing citrus aurantium anywhere in the world 
the fda s decision to ban ephedra triggered a significant reaction by the national media  some of whom are calling for the repeal or amendment of dshea 
these media view supposed weaknesses within dshea as the underlying reason why ephedra was allowed to remain on the market 
we have been advised that dshea opponents in congress may use this anti dshea momentum to advance new legislation during the th congress to amend or repeal dshea 
if this should occur we believe that the dshea opponents may propose the following premarket approval for safety and effectiveness of dietary ingredients  specific premarket review of dietary ingredient stimulants that are being used to replace ephedra  reversal of the burden of proof standard which now rests on the fda  and a redefining of dietary ingredient to remove either botanicals or selected classes of ingredients now treated as dietary ingredients 
on december   a new law went into effect in the united states mandating the reporting of all serious adverse events occurring within the united states which involve dietary supplements or otc drugs 
we believe that 
table of contents we are in full compliance with this new law having promulgated and implemented a worldwide procedure governing adverse event identification  investigation and reporting which is managed by our scientific affairs department in collaboration with our medical affairs department and our distributor relations call centers 
as a result of our receipt of adverse event reports  we may from time to time elect  or be required  to remove a product from a market  either temporarily or permanently 
on june   the fda published its final rule regulating current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  for dietary supplements 
this final rule became effective on august   and herbalife will have until june  to achieve compliance 
the final rule requires that companies establish written procedures governing personnel  plant and equipment cleanliness  lab and testing  packaging and labeling  and distribution 
the fda also required percent identity testing of all incoming raw materials  although an interim final rule enables companies to petition for an exemption from the percent testing requirement if they can demonstrate the existence of an appropriate statistical sampling program 
the new cgmps will help ensure that dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities  and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products 
we have evaluated the final cgmp rule with respect to its potential impact upon the various contract manufacturers that we use to manufacture our products  some of which might not meet the new standards 
it is important to note that the final cgmp rule  in an effort to limit disruption  includes a three year phase in for small businesses 
this will mean that some of our contract manufacturers will not be fully impacted by the proposed regulation until at least however  the final cgmp rule can be expected to result in additional costs and possibly the need to seek alternate suppliers 
see item a risk factors for further discussion regarding the recently promulgated cgmp regulations 
some of the products marketed by us are considered conventional foods and are currently labeled as such 
within the united states  this category of products is subject to the nutrition  labeling and education act  or nlea  and regulations promulgated under the nlea 
the nlea regulates health claims  ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product 
the ingredients added to conventional foods must either be generally recognized as safe by experts  or gras  or be approved as food additives under fda regulations 
in foreign markets  prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market  we may be required to obtain an approval  license or certification from the relevant country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
where a formal approval  license or certification is not required  we nonetheless seek a favorable opinion of counsel regarding our compliance with applicable laws 
prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval  license or certificate is required  we work extensively with local authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals 
the approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators and  in some instances  arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis 
the approvals may be conditioned on reformulation of our products  or may be unavailable with respect to some products or some ingredients 
product reformulation or the inability to introduce some products or ingredients into a particular market may have an adverse effect on sales 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market  either temporarily or permanently 
in  herbalife voluntarily elected to temporarily withdraw its sesame herb tablet product from the israeli market 
this product  which has been on the market since  was sold only in israel 
herbalife s voluntary decision to temporarily withdraw this product accompanied the initiation of a review by the israeli ministry of health of anecdotal case reports of individuals having varying liver conditions when it was reported that a small number of these individuals had consumed herbalife products 
herbalife scientists and medical doctors have closely cooperated with the ministry of health to facilitate this review 
this review is ongoing and there can be no assurances as to the outcome 
the ftc  which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products  has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products 
these enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and monetary payments by the companies involved 
in addition  the ftc has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials  which we also utilize  as well as the role of expert endorsers and 
table of contents product clinical studies 
although we have not been the target of ftc enforcement action for the advertising of our products  we cannot be sure that the ftc  or comparable foreign agencies  will not question our advertising or other operations in the future 
it is unclear whether the ftc will subject our advertisements to increased surveillance to ensure compliance with the principles set forth in its published advertising guidance 
in europe  an eu health claim regulation was recently finalized 
the final regulation will have an adverse effect on existing product wellness  well being and good for you claims presently made on existing product labeling  literature and advertising 
herbalife is currently assembling the necessary scientific substantiation for its european product claims based on the requirements of this recently enacted regulation 
in some countries  regulations applicable to the activities of our distributors also may affect our business because in some countries we are  or regulators may assert that we are  responsible for our distributors conduct 
in these countries  regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our distributors comply with local regulations 
the types of regulated conduct include representations concerning our products  income representations made by us and or distributors  public media advertisements  which in foreign markets may require prior approval by regulators  and sales of products in markets in which the products have not been approved  licensed or certified for sale 
in some markets  it is possible that improper product claims by distributors could result in our products being reviewed by regulatory authorities and  as a result  being classified or placed into another category as to which stricter regulations are applicable 
in addition  we might be required to make labeling changes 
we are unable to predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations or applications  nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business in the future 
they could  however  require the reformulation of some products not capable of being reformulated  imposition of additional record keeping requirements  expanded documentation of the properties of some products  expanded or different labeling  additional scientific substantiation regarding product ingredients  safety or usefulness  and or additional distributor compliance surveillance and enforcement action by us 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
all of our officers and directors are subject to a permanent injunction issued in october pursuant to the settlement of an action instituted by the california attorney general  the state health director and the santa cruz county district attorney 
we consented to the entry of this injunction without in any way admitting the allegations of the complaint 
the injunction prevents us and our officers and directors from making specified claims in future advertising of our products and required us to implement some documentation systems with respect to payments to our distributors 
at the same time  the injunction does not prevent us from continuing to make specified claims concerning our products that have been made and are being made  provided that we have a reasonable basis for making the claims 
we are aware that  in some of our international markets  there has been recent adverse publicity concerning products that contain ingredients that have been genetically modified  or gm 
in some markets  the possibility of health risks or perceived consumer preference thought to be associated with gm ingredients has prompted proposed or actual governmental regulation 
for example  the european union has adopted a ec regulation affecting the labeling of products containing ingredients that have been genetically modified  and the documents manufacturers and marketers will need to possess to ensure traceability at all steps in the chain of production and distribution 
this new regulation  which took effect in  has been implemented by us and our contract manufacturers  resulting in modifications to our labeling  and in some instances  to some of our foods and food supplements sold in europe 
differing gm regulations affecting us also have been adopted in brazil  japan  korea  taiwan and thailand 
we cannot anticipate the extent to which future regulations in our markets will restrict the use of gm ingredients in our products or the impact of any regulations on our business in those markets 
in response to any applicable regulations  we would  where practicable  attempt to reformulate our products to satisfy the regulations 
we believe  based upon currently available information  that compliance with regulatory requirements in this area should not have a material adverse effect on us or our business 
however  because publicity and governmental scrutiny of gm ingredients is a relatively new and evolving area  there can be no assurance in this regard 
if a significant number of our products were found to be genetically modified and regulations in our markets 
table of contents significantly restricted the use of gm ingredients in our products  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have been required to comply with recent regulations within the european union  australia  brazil  canada  china  hong kong  japan  taiwan  and thailand affecting the use and or labeling of irradiated raw ingredients 
compliance with gm  bse and irradiation regulations can be expected to increase the cost of manufacturing certain of our products 
network marketing program our network marketing program is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the ftc and various state agencies as well as regulations in foreign markets administered by foreign agencies 
regulations applicable to network marketing organizations generally are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within our organization is based on sales of the organization s products rather than investments in the organization or other non retail sales related criteria 
for instance  in some markets  there are limits on the extent to which distributors may earn royalty overrides on sales generated by distributors that were not directly sponsored by the distributor 
when required by law  we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing program or  when this approval is not required  the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance 
nevertheless  we remain subject to the risk that  in one or more markets  our marketing system could be found not to be in compliance with applicable regulations 
failure by us to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
on april   the ftc  issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which  if implemented  will regulate all sellers of business opportunities in the united states 
the proposed rule would  among other things  require all sellers of business opportunities  which would likely include herbalife  to i implement a seven day waiting period before entering into an agreement with a prospective business opportunity purchaser  and ii provide all prospective business opportunity purchasers with substantial information in writing at the beginning of the waiting period regarding the business opportunity  including information relating to representations made as to the earnings experience of other business opportunity purchasers  the names and telephone numbers of recent purchasers in their geographic area  cancellation or refund policies and requests within the prior two years  certain legal actions against the company  its affiliated companies and company officers  directors  sales managers and certain others 
we  other direct selling companies  the direct selling association  or the dsa  and other interested parties have filed over  comments with the ftc that are publicly available regarding the proposed rule through the ftc s website at http www 
ftc 
gov os comments businessopprule index 
htm 
we  the dsa  other direct selling companies  and other interested parties also filed rebuttal comments with the ftc in september  based on information currently available  we anticipate that the final rule may require several years to become final and effective  and may differ substantially from the rule as originally proposed 
nevertheless the proposed rule  if implemented in its original form  would negatively impact our us business 
we also are subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our network marketing program 
for example  in webster v 
omnitrition international  inc  f 
d th cir 
 the multi level marketing program of omnitrition international  inc  or omnitrition  was successfully challenged in a class action by omnitrition distributors who alleged that omnitrition was operating an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal and state laws 
we believe that our network marketing program satisfies the standards set forth in the omnitrition case and other applicable statutes and case law defining a legal marketing system  in part based upon significant differences between our marketing system and that described in the omnitrition case 
herbalife international and certain of its independent distributors have been named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit filed february   in the superior court of california  county of san francisco  and served on herbalife international on march  minton v 
herbalife international  et al 
the case has been transferred to the los angeles county superior court 
the plaintiff is challenging the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes  insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans  unfair and deceptive 
table of contents business practices  and fraud and deceit 
the plaintiff alleges that the freedom group system operated by certain independent distributors of herbalife international products places too much emphasis on recruiting and encourages excessively large purchases of product and promotional materials by distributors 
the plaintiff also alleges that freedom group pressured distributors to disseminate misleading promotional materials 
the plaintiff seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the actions of its independent distributors and is seeking damages and injunctive relief 
on january   the superior court denied class certification of all claims  except for the claim under california law prohibiting endless chain schemes 
that claim was granted california only class certification  provided that class counsel is able to substitute in as a plaintiff a california resident with claims typical of the class 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the suit 
herbalife international and certain of its distributors were defendants in a class action lawsuit filed july   in the circuit court of ohio county in the state of west virginia mey v 
herbalife international  inc  et al 
the complaint alleged that certain telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violated the telephone consumer protection act  or tcpa  and sought to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of its independent distributors 
more specifically  the plaintiffs complaint alleged that several of herbalife international s distributors used pre recorded telephone messages and faxes to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpa s prohibition of such practices 
without in any way acknowledging liability or wrongdoing by us or our independent distributors  we and the other defendants have reached a binding settlement with the plaintiffs 
under the terms of the settlement the defendants collectively paid million into a fund to be distributed to qualifying class members 
the relevant amount paid by us was previously fully reserved in our financial statements 
the settlement has received the final approval of the court in january we are also subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our network marketing program 
the multi level marketing programs of other companies have been successfully challenged in the past  and in a current lawsuit  allegations have been made challenging the legality of our network marketing program in belgium 
test ankoop test achat  a belgian consumer protection organization  sued herbalife international belgium  sv  or hib  on august   alleging that hib violated article of the belgian fair trade practices act by engaging in pyramid selling  ie  establishing a network of professional or non professional sales people who hope to make a profit more through the expansion of that network rather than through the sale of products to end consumers 
the plaintiff is seeking a payment of  equal to approximately  as of december  per purported violation as well as costs of the trial 
for the year ended december   our net sales in belgium were approximately million 
currently  the lawsuit is in the pleading stage 
the plaintiffs filed their initial brief on september  we filed a reply brief on may  there is no date yet for the oral hearings 
an adverse judicial determination with respect to our network marketing program  or in proceedings not involving us directly but which challenge the legality of multi level marketing systems  in belgium or in any other market in which we operate  could negatively impact our business 
it is an ongoing part of our business to monitor and respond to regulatory and legal developments  including those that may affect our network marketing program 
however  the regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include bright line rules and are inherently fact based 
an adverse judicial determination with respect to our network marketing program could have a material adverse effect on our business 
an adverse determination could require us to make modifications to our network marketing program  result in negative publicity or have a negative impact on distributor morale 
in addition  adverse rulings by courts in any proceedings challenging the legality of multi level marketing systems  even in those not involving us directly  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
transfer pricing and similar regulations in many countries  including the united states  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our us or local entities and are taxed accordingly 
in addition  our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions  we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert 
table of contents that additional taxes are owed 
for example  we are currently subject to pending or proposed audits that are at various levels of review  assessment or appeal in a number of jurisdictions involving transfer pricing issues  income taxes  duties  value added taxes  withholding taxes and related interest and penalties in material amounts 
in some circumstances  additional taxes  interest and penalties have been assessed  and we will be required to appeal or litigate to reverse the assessments 
we have taken advice from our tax advisors and believe that there are substantial defenses to the allegations that additional taxes are owed  and we are vigorously defending against the imposition of additional proposed taxes 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may take several years  and the outcome is uncertain 
in the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us  we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits 
currently  we anticipate utilizing the majority of our foreign tax credits in the year in which they arise with the unused amount carried forward 
because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment  we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future 
as a result  adverse outcomes in these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
other regulations we also are subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets  including regulations pertaining to social security assessments  employment and severance pay requirements  import export regulations and antitrust issues 
as an example  in many markets  we are substantially restricted in the amount and types of rules and termination criteria that we can impose on distributors without having to pay social security assessments on behalf of the distributors and without incurring severance obligations to terminated distributors 
in some countries  we may be subject to these obligations in any event 
our failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
assertions that we failed to comply with regulations or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could adversely affect us in other markets as well by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets 
compliance procedures as indicated above  herbalife  our products and our network marketing program are subject  both directly and indirectly through distributors conduct  to numerous federal  state and local regulations  both in the united states and foreign markets 
beginning in  we began to institute formal regulatory compliance measures by developing a system to identify specific complaints against distributors and to remedy any violations of herbalife s rules by distributors through appropriate sanctions  including warnings  suspensions and  when necessary  terminations 
in our manuals  seminars and other training programs and materials  we emphasize that distributors are prohibited from making therapeutic claims for our products 
our general policy regarding acceptance of distributor applications from individuals who do not reside in one of our markets is to refuse to accept the individual s distributor application 
from time to time  exceptions to the policy are made on a country by country basis 
in order to comply with regulations that apply to both us and our distributors  we conduct considerable research into the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify all necessary licenses and approvals and applicable limitations on our operations in that market 
typically  we conduct this research with the assistance of local legal counsel and other representatives 
we devote substantial resources to obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals and bringing our operations into compliance with the applicable limitations 
we also research laws applicable to distributor operations and revise or alter our distributor manuals and other training materials and programs to provide distributors with guidelines for operating a business  marketing and distributing our products and similar matters  as required by applicable regulations in each market 
we  however  are unable to monitor our supervisors and distributors effectively to ensure that they refrain from distributing our products in countries where we have not commenced operations  and we do not devote significant resources to this type of monitoring 

table of contents in addition  regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators 
moreover  even when we believe that we and our distributors are initially in compliance with all applicable regulations  new regulations regularly are being added and the interpretation of existing regulations is subject to change 
further  the content and impact of regulations to which we are subject may be influenced by public attention directed at us  our products or our network marketing program  so that extensive adverse publicity about us  our products or our network marketing program may result in increased regulatory scrutiny 
it is an ongoing part of our business to anticipate and respond to new and changing regulations and to make corresponding changes in our operations to the extent practicable 
although we devote considerable resources to maintaining our compliance with regulatory constraints in each of our markets  we cannot be sure that we would be found to be in full compliance with applicable regulations in all of our markets at any given time or the regulatory authorities in one or more markets will not assert  either retroactively or prospectively or both  that our operations are not in full compliance 
these assertions or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could negatively affect us in other markets as well by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets 
these assertions could have a material adverse effect on us in a particular market or in general 
furthermore  depending upon the severity of regulatory changes in a particular market and the changes in our operations that would be necessitated to maintain compliance  these changes could result in our experiencing a material reduction in sales in the market or determining to exit the market altogether 
in this event  we would attempt to devote the resources previously devoted to the market  to a new market or markets or other existing markets 
however  we cannot be sure that this transition would not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations either in the short or long term 
trademarks and proprietary formulas we use the umbrella trademarks herbalife and the tri leaf design worldwide  and protect several other trademarks and trade names related to our products and operations  such as shapeworks  nourifusion  and liftoff 
our trademark registrations are issued through the united states patent and trademark office and comparable agencies in the foreign countries 
we consider our trademarks and trade names to be an important factor in our business 
we also take care in protecting the intellectual property rights of our proprietary formulas by restricting access to our formulas within the company to those persons or departments that require access to them to perform their functions  and by requiring our finished goods suppliers and consultants to execute supply and non disclosure agreements that seek to contractually protect our intellectual property rights 
disclosure of these formulas  in redacted form  is also necessary to obtain sanitary registrations in many countries 
we also make efforts to protect some unique formulations under patent law 
for example  we have sought through our employee inventors one or more patents in the united states and certain other markets to protect the formulation of the liftoff brand effervescent supplement 
the united states patent office has recently granted patent no 
 to our employee inventors for the composition that constitutes the current us total control product formula 
all rights in this patent have been assigned to herbalife 
we strive to protect all new product developments as the confidential trade secrets of the company and its inventor employees 
however  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our proprietary rights 
competition the business of marketing weight management and nutrition products is highly competitive 
this market segment includes numerous manufacturers  distributors  marketers  retailers and physicians that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the united states and abroad 
the market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or weight management plans  including various prescription and over the counter drugs that may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
as a result  our ability to remain competitive depends in part upon the successful introduction of new products 
in addition  we anticipate that we will be subject to increasing competition in the future from sellers that utilize electronic commerce 
we cannot be sure of the impact of electronic commerce or that it will not adversely affect our business 
we are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of distributors from other network marketing organizations  including those that market weight management products  nutritional supplements and personal care 
table of contents products  as well as other types of products 
some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are  and have considerably greater financial resources than we have 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors through an attractive compensation plan and other incentives 
we believe that our production bonus program  international sponsorship program and other compensation and incentive programs provide our distributors with significant earning potential 
however  we cannot be sure that our programs for recruitment and retention of distributors will be successful

employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
in china  as of december   we also had labor contracts with approximately  employed sales representatives 
these numbers do not include our distributors  who are independent contractors rather than employees 
except for some employees in mexico and in certain european countries  none of our employees are members of any labor union  and we have never experienced any business interruption as a result of any labor disputes

item a 
risk factors our failure to establish and maintain distributor relationships for any reason could negatively impact sales of our products and harm our financial condition and operating results 
we distribute our products exclusively through over million independent distributors  and we depend upon them directly for substantially all of our sales 
to increase our revenue  we must increase the number of  or the productivity of  our distributors 
accordingly  our success depends in significant part upon our ability to recruit  retain and motivate a large base of distributors 
there is a high rate of turnover among our distributors  a characteristic of the network marketing business 
the loss of a significant number of distributors for any reason could negatively impact sales of our products and could impair our ability to attract new distributors 
in our efforts to attract and retain distributors  we compete with other network marketing organizations  including those in the weight management  dietary and nutritional supplement and personal care and cosmetic product industries 
our operating results could be harmed if our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient interest to retain existing distributors and attract new distributors 
in light of the high year over year rate of turnover in our distributor base  we have our supervisors re qualify annually in order to help us maintain a more accurate count of their numbers 
for the latest twelve month re qualification period ending january  of our supervisors re qualified 
distributors who purchase our product for personal consumption or for short term income goals may stay with us for several months to one year 
supervisors who have committed time and effort to build a sales organization will generally stay for longer periods 

table of contents distributors have highly variable levels of training  skills and capabilities 
the turnover rate of our distributors  and our operating results  can be adversely impacted if we  and our senior distributor leadership  do not provide the necessary mentoring  training and business support tools for new distributors to become successful sales people in a short period of time 
we estimate that  of our over million independent distributors  we had approximately  sales leaders as of december  these sales leaders  together with their downline sales organizations  account for substantially all of our revenues 
our distributors  including our sales leaders  may voluntarily terminate their distributor agreements with us at any time 
the loss of a group of leading sales leaders  together with their downline sales organizations  or the loss of a significant number of distributors for any reason  could negatively impact sales of our products  impair our ability to attract new distributors and harm our financial condition and operating results 
since we cannot exert the same level of influence or control over our independent distributors as we could were they our own employees  our distributors could fail to comply with our distributor policies and procedures  which could result in claims against us that could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our distributors are independent contractors and  accordingly  we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction  motivation and oversight as we would if distributors were our own employees 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our distributors will participate in our marketing strategies or plans  accept our introduction of new products  or comply with our distributor policies and procedures 
extensive federal  state and local laws regulate our business  products and network marketing program 
because we have expanded into foreign countries  our policies and procedures for our independent distributors differ due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business 
while we have implemented distributor policies and procedures designed to govern distributor conduct and to protect the goodwill associated with herbalife trademarks and tradenames  it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of distributors and their independent status 
violations by our independent distributors of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations and harm our business reputation 
in addition  it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our independent distributors 
adverse publicity associated with our products  ingredients or network marketing program  or those of similar companies  could harm our financial condition and operating results 
the size of our distribution force and the results of our operations may be significantly affected by the public s perception of the company and similar companies 
this perception is dependent upon opinions concerning the safety and quality of our products and ingredients  the safety and quality of similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies  our distributors  our network marketing program  and the direct selling business generally 
adverse publicity concerning any actual or purported failure of our company or our independent distributors to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding product claims and advertising  good manufacturing practices  the regulation of our network marketing program  the licensing of our products for sale in our target markets or other aspects of our business  whether or not resulting in enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties  could have an adverse effect on the goodwill of our company and could negatively affect our ability to attract  motivate and retain distributors  which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue 
we cannot ensure that all distributors will comply with applicable legal requirements relating to the advertising  labeling  licensing or distribution of our products 

table of contents in addition  our distributors and consumers perception of the safety and quality of our products and ingredients as well as similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies can be significantly influenced by media attention  publicized scientific research or findings  widespread product liability claims and other publicity concerning our products or ingredients or similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies 
adverse publicity  whether or not accurate or resulting from consumers use or misuse of our products  that associates consumption of our products or ingredients or any similar products or ingredients with illness or other adverse effects  questions the benefits of our or similar products or claims that any such products are ineffective  inappropriately labeled or have inaccurate instructions as to their use  could negatively impact our reputation or the market demand for our products 
from time to time we receive inquiries from government agencies and third parties requesting information concerning our products 
we fully cooperate with these inquiries including  when requested  by the submission of detailed technical dossiers addressing product composition  manufacturing  process control  quality assurance  and contaminant testing 
we understand that such materials are undergoing review by regulators in certain markets 
we are confident in the safety of our products when used as directed 
however  there can be no assurance that regulators in these or other markets will not take actions that might delay or prevent the introduction of new products  or require the reformulation or the temporary or permanent withdrawal of certain of our existing products from their markets 
adverse publicity relating to us  our products or our operations  including our network marketing program or the attractiveness or viability of the financial opportunities provided thereby  has had  and could again have  a negative effect on our ability to attract  motivate and retain distributors 
in the mid s  our products and marketing program became the subject of regulatory scrutiny in the united states  resulting in large part from claims and representations made about our products by our independent distributors  including impermissible therapeutic claims 
the resulting adverse publicity caused a rapid  substantial loss of distributors in the united states and a corresponding reduction in sales beginning in we expect that negative publicity will  from time to time  continue to negatively impact our business in particular markets 
our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm our distributor and customer relationships and product sales and harm our financial condition and operating results 
our business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences  especially with respect to weight management products 
our continued success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes  and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes 
furthermore  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions and enhancements 
our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products  which in turn could harm our customer and distributor relationships and cause the loss of sales 
the success of our new product offerings and enhancements depends upon a number of factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new products or product enhancements that meet these needs  successfully commercialize new products or product enhancements in a timely manner  price our products competitively  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner  and differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors 
if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a timely manner  some of our products could be rendered obsolete  which could negatively impact our revenues  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents due to the high level of competition in our industry  we might fail to retain our customers and distributors  which would harm our financial condition and operating results 
the business of marketing weight management and nutrition products is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new products or weight management plans  including various prescription drugs  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
these market segments include numerous manufacturers  distributors  marketers  retailers and physicians that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  we anticipate that we will be subject to increasing competition in the future from sellers that utilize electronic commerce 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and sales resources  greater name recognition  larger established customer bases and better developed distribution channels than we do 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop products that are comparable or superior to those we offer  adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies  evolving industry trends and standards or customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
for example  if our competitors develop other diet or weight loss treatments that prove to be more effective than our products  demand for our products could be reduced 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets and competition may intensify 
we are also subject to significant competition for the recruitment of distributors from other network marketing organizations  including those that market weight management products  dietary and nutritional supplements and personal care products as well as other types of products 
we compete for global customers and distributors with regard to weight management  nutritional supplement and personal care products 
our competitors include both direct selling companies such as nuskin enterprises  nature s sunshine  alticor amway  melaleuca  avon products  oriflame and mary kay  as well as retail establishments such as weight watchers  jenny craig  general nutrition centers  wal mart and retail pharmacies 
in addition  because the industry in which we operate is not particularly capital intensive or otherwise subject to high barriers to entry  it is relatively easy for new competitors to emerge who will compete with us for our distributors and customers 
in addition  the fact that our distributors may easily enter and exit our network marketing program contributes to the level of competition that we face 
for example  a distributor can enter or exit our network marketing system with relative ease at any time without facing a significant investment or loss of capital because we have a low upfront financial cost to become a herbalife distributor  we do not require any specific amount of time to work as a distributor  we do not insist on any special training to be a distributor and we do not prohibit a new distributor from working with another company 
our ability to remain competitive therefore depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors through an attractive compensation plan  the maintenance of an attractive product portfolio and other incentives 
we cannot ensure that our programs for recruitment and retention of distributors will be successful  and if they are not  our financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
we are affected by extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints both domestically and abroad  and our failure or our distributors failure to comply with these restraints could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
in both domestic and foreign markets  the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  exportation  licensing  sale and storage of our products are affected by extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints 
such laws  regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal  state or local levels in the united states and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that we or our distributors are in compliance with all of these regulations 
our failure or our distributors failure to comply with these regulations or new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could negatively impact our business 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products  resulting in significant loss of sales revenues 

table of contents on april   the ftc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which  if implemented  will regulate all sellers of business opportunities in the united states 
the proposed rule would  among other things  require all sellers of business opportunities  which would likely include herbalife  to i implement a seven day waiting period before entering into an agreement with a prospective business opportunity purchaser  and ii provide all prospective business opportunity purchasers with substantial information in writing at the beginning of the waiting period regarding the business opportunity  including information relating to representations made as to the earnings experience of other business opportunity purchasers  the names and telephone numbers of recent purchasers in their geographic area  cancellation or refund policies and requests within the prior two years  certain legal actions against the company  its affiliated companies and company officers  directors  sales managers and certain others 
we  other direct selling companies  the direct selling association  or the dsa  and other interested parties have filed over  comments with the ftc that are publicly available regarding the proposed rule through the ftc s website at http www 
ftc 
gov os comments businessopprule index 
htm 
we  the dsa  other direct selling companies  and other interested parties also filed rebuttal comments with the ftc in september  based on information currently available  we anticipate that the final rule may require several years to become final and effective  and may differ substantially from the rule as originally proposed 
nevertheless the proposed rule  if implemented in its original form  would negatively impact our us business 
governmental regulations in countries where we plan to commence or expand operations may prevent or delay entry into those markets 
in addition  our ability to sustain satisfactory levels of sales in our markets is dependent in significant part on our ability to introduce additional products into such markets 
however  governmental regulations in our markets  both domestic and international  can delay or prevent the introduction  or require the reformulation or withdrawal  of certain of our products 
for example  during the third quarter of  we received inquiries from certain governmental agencies within germany and portugal regarding our product  thermojetics instant herbal beverage  relating to the caffeine content of the product and the status of the product as an instant tea  which was disfavored by regulators  versus a beverage 
although we initially suspended the product sale in germany and portugal at the request of the regulators  we successfully reintroduced it once regulatory issues were satisfactorily resolved 
any such regulatory action  whether or not it results in a final determination adverse to us  could create negative publicity  with detrimental effects on the motivation and recruitment of distributors and  consequently  on sales 
on june   the fda published its final rule for cgmps affecting the manufacture  packing  and holding of dietary supplements 
the final rule requires identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients  but permits the use of certificates of analysis or other documentation to verify the reliability of the ingredient suppliers 
on the same date the fda also published an interim final rule that outlined a petition process for manufacturers to request an exemption to the cgmp requirement for percent identity testing of specific dietary ingredients used in the processing of dietary supplements 
under the interim final rule the manufacturer may be exempted from the dietary ingredient testing requirement if it can provide sufficient documentation that the reduced frequency of testing requested would still ensure the identity of the dietary ingredient 
the final rule includes a phased in effective date based on the size of the manufacturer 
the final rule and the interim final rule became effective august  to limit any disruption for dietary supplements produced by small businesses the final rule has a three year phase in for small businesses 
companies with more than employees  such as herbalife  have until june  to comply while companies with fewer than employees have until june to comply and companies with fewer than employees have until june to comply with these regulations 
these rules apply only to manufacturers and holders of finished products and not to ingredient suppliers unless the ingredient supplier is manufacturing a final dietary supplement 
the final rule differs from the fda s proposed rule as it does not contain language regarding the regulatory status of excipients and other ingredients that are not dietary ingredients 
instead  the final rule relies on a requirement to comply with all other relevant regulations 
further  the final rule does not call for any specific finished product testing program nor does it require testing of all finished products 
instead the final rule calls for a scientifically valid system for ensuring that finished products meet all specifications 
although we  in consultation with experts in the field  are currently evaluating the likely impact of the final rule and the interim final rule on our business and the contract manufacturers we utilize to manufacture our products  it is likely that the final cgmp rules will result in additional costs and possibly the need to seek alternate suppliers 

table of contents our network marketing program could be found to be not in compliance with current or newly adopted laws or regulations in one or more markets  which could prevent us from conducting our business in these markets and harm our financial condition and operating results 
our network marketing program is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the ftc and various state agencies in the united states as well as regulations on direct selling in foreign markets administered by foreign agencies 
we are subject to the risk that  in one or more markets  our network marketing program could be found not to be in compliance with applicable law or regulations 
regulations applicable to network marketing organizations generally are directed at preventing fraudulent or deceptive schemes  often referred to as pyramid or chain sales schemes  by ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within an organization is based on sales of the organization s products rather than investments in the organization or other non retail sales related criteria 
the regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include bright line rules and are inherently fact based  and thus  even in jurisdictions where we believe that our network marketing program is in full compliance with applicable laws or regulations governing network marketing systems  we are subject to the risk that these laws or regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts can change 
the failure of our network marketing program to comply with current or newly adopted regulations could negatively impact our business in a particular market or in general 
we are also subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our network marketing program 
the multi level marketing programs of other companies have been successfully challenged in the past  and in a current lawsuit  allegations have been made challenging the legality of our network marketing program in belgium 
test ankoop test achat  a belgian consumer protection organization  sued herbalife international belgium  sv  or hib  on august   alleging that hib violated article of the belgian fair trade practices act by engaging in pyramid selling  ie  establishing a network of professional or non professional sales people who hope to make a profit more through the expansion of that network than through the sale of products to end consumers 
the plaintiff is seeking a payment of  equal to approximately  as of december  per purported violation as well as costs of the trial 
for the year ended december   our net sales in belgium were approximately million 
currently  the lawsuit is in the pleading stage 
the plaintiffs filed their initial brief on september  we filed a reply brief on may  there is no date yet for the oral hearings 
an adverse judicial determination with respect to our network marketing program  or in proceedings not involving us directly but which challenge the legality of multi level marketing systems  in belgium or in any other market in which we operate  could negatively impact our business 
we learned on november  that barry minkow of the fraud discovery institute had published a letter  dated october   to certain officials of the government of the people s republic of china 
the letter includes numerous allegations of allegedly wrongful conduct by herbalife and its employees in china and elsewhere 
mr 
minkow s letter attacks  among other things  our business practices in china as illegal under chinese law 
contrary to the allegations in the letter  we have acted in a responsible manner with regard to our business plans in china including retaining knowledgeable chinese counsel to assist it in complying with chinese law 
in connection with our application for our direct selling license in china  our plan and methods for business in china were reviewed by members of the state and provincial governments of china and an initial license was granted in march and a subsequent expansion of that license was granted in july in addition  we have designed and implemented systems and financial and operational controls intended to ensure compliance with applicable law 
we believe that our plan and methods for business in china are in compliance with applicable law 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign markets  exposing us to the risks of trade or foreign exchange restrictions  increased tariffs  foreign currency fluctuations and similar risks associated with foreign operations 
approximately of our net sales for the year ended december   were generated outside the united states  exposing our business to risks associated with foreign operations 
for example  a foreign government may impose trade or foreign exchange restrictions or increased tariffs  which could negatively impact our operations 
we are also exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
for instance  purchases from suppliers are generally made in us dollars while sales to distributors are generally made in local currencies 

table of contents accordingly  strengthening of the us dollar versus a foreign currency could have a negative impact on us 
although we engage in transactions to protect against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot be certain any hedging activity will effectively reduce our exchange rate exposure 
our operations in some markets also may be adversely affected by political  economic and social instability in foreign countries 
as we continue to focus on expanding our existing international operations  these and other risks associated with international operations may increase  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
currency restrictions enacted by the venezuelan government in have become more restrictive and have impacted the ability of our subsidiary in venezuela  or herbalife venezuela  to obtain us dollars at the official foreign exchange rate to pay for imported products 
unless our ability to obtain us dollars at the official foreign exchange rate is made more readily available  the results of herbalife venezuela s operations could be negatively impacted as it may need to obtain us dollars from non government sources where the exchange rate is weaker than the official rate 
our expansion in china is subject to general  as well as industry specific  economic  political and legal developments and risks in china and requires that we utilize a different business model from which we use elsewhere in the world 
our expansion of operations into china is subject to risks and uncertainties related to general economic  political and legal developments in china  among other things 
the chinese government exercises significant control over the chinese economy  including but not limited to controlling capital investments  allocating resources  setting monetary policy  controlling foreign exchange and monitoring foreign exchange rates  implementing and overseeing tax regulations  providing preferential treatment to certain industry segments or companies and issuing necessary licenses to conduct business 
accordingly  any adverse change in the chinese economy  the chinese legal system or chinese governmental  economic or other policies could have a material adverse effect on our business in china and our prospects generally 
in august  china published regulations governing direct selling effective december  and prohibiting pyramid promotional schemes effective november   and a number of administrative methods and proclamations were issued in september and in september these regulations require us to use a business model different from that which we offer in other markets 
to allow us to operate under these regulations  we have created and introduced a model specifically for china 
in china  we have company operated retail stores that sell through employed sales management personnel to customers and preferred customers 
we provide training and certification procedures for sales personnel in china 
we also have non employee sales representatives who sell through our retail stores 
our sales representatives are also permitted by the terms of our direct selling license to sell away from fixed retail locations in the jiangsu province 
these features are not common to the business model we employ elsewhere in the world  and based on the direct selling licenses we have received and the terms of those which we hope to receive in the future to conduct a direct selling enterprise in china  our business model in china will continue in some part to incorporate such features 
the direct selling regulations require us to apply for various approvals to conduct a direct selling enterprise in china 
the process for obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct a direct selling business is protracted and cumbersome and involves multiple layers of chinese governmental authorities and numerous governmental employees at each layer 
while direct selling licenses are centrally issued  such licenses are generally valid only in the jurisdictions within which related approvals have been obtained 
such approvals are generally awarded on local and provincial bases  and the approval process requires involvement with multiple ministries at each level 
our participation and conduct during the approval process is guided not only by distinct chinese practices and customs  but is also subject to applicable laws of china and the other jurisdictions in which we operate our business  including the us  and our internal code of ethics 
there is always a risk that in attempting to comply with local customs and practices in china during the application process or otherwise  we will fail to comply with requirements applicable to us in china itself or in other jurisdictions  and any such failure to comply with applicable requirements could prevent us from obtaining the direct selling licenses or related local or provincial approvals 
furthermore  we rely on certain key personnel in china to assist us during the approval process  and the loss of any such key personnel could delay or hinder our ability to obtain licenses or related approvals 
for all of the above reasons  there can be no assurance that we will obtain additional direct selling licenses  or obtain related approvals to expand into any or all of the localities or provinces in china that are 
table of contents important to our business 
our inability to obtain  retain  or renew any or all of the licenses or related approvals that are required for us to operate in china would negatively impact our business 
additionally  although certain regulations have been published with respect to obtaining such approvals  operating under such approvals and otherwise conducting business in china  others are pending  and there is uncertainty regarding the interpretation and enforcement of chinese regulations 
the regulatory environment in china is evolving  and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations 
we cannot be certain that our business model will continue to be deemed by national or local chinese regulatory authorities to be compliant with any such regulations 
in the past  the chinese government has rigorously monitored the direct selling market in china  and has taken serious action against companies that the government believed were engaging in activities they regarded to be in violation of applicable law  including shutting down their businesses and imposing substantial fines 
as a result  there can be no guarantee that the chinese government s current or future interpretation and application of the existing and new regulations will not negatively impact our business in china  result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties against us or our chinese distributors 
chinese regulations prevent persons who are not chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in china 
we cannot guarantee that any of our distributors living outside of china or any of our independent sales representatives or employed sales management personnel in china have not engaged or will not engage in activities that violate our policies in this market  or that violate chinese law or other applicable law  and therefore result in regulatory action and adverse publicity 
as we expand operations in china  we anticipate that certain distributors will switch their focus from their home markets to that of china 
as a result  we may see reduced distributor focus in hong kong  taiwan and possibly other of our markets as chinese nationals that are distributors shift their attention to china  and a resultant reduction in distributor growth  leadership and revenue in these other countries 
recently  china enacted a labor contract law which is expected to become effective in early we are reviewing the new law to determine what changes  if any  will be required in our employment contracts and contractual relations with our employees  which include certain of our salespersons 
there is no guarantee that the new law will not adversely impact us  force us to change our treatment of our distributor employees  or cause us to change our operating plan for china 
if our operations in china are successful  we may experience rapid growth in china  and there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully manage rapid expansion of manufacturing operations and a rapidly growing and dynamic sales force 
there also can be no assurances that we will not experience difficulties in dealing with or taking employment related actions such as hiring  terminations and salary administration  including social benefit payments with respect to our employed sales representatives  particularly given the highly regulated nature of the employment relationship in china 
if we are unable to effectively manage such growth and expansion of our retail stores  manufacturing operations or our employees  our government relations may be compromised and our operations in china may be harmed 
our china business model  particularly with regard to sales management responsibilities and remuneration  differs from our traditional business model 
there is a risk that such changes and transitions may not be understood by our distributors or employees  may be viewed negatively by our distributors or employees  or may not be correctly utilized by our distributors or employees 
if that is the case  our business could be negatively impacted 
if we fail to further penetrate existing markets or successfully expand our business into new markets  then the growth in sales of our products  along with our operating results  could be negatively impacted 
the success of our business is to a large extent contingent on our ability to continue to grow by entering new markets and further penetrating existing markets 
our ability to further penetrate existing markets or to successfully expand our business into additional countries in eastern europe  southeast asia  south america or elsewhere  to the extent we believe that we have identified attractive geographic expansion opportunities in the future  is subject to numerous factors  many of which are out of our control 

table of contents in addition  government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction  or require the reformulation or withdrawal  of some of our products  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  our ability to increase market penetration in certain countries may be limited by the finite number of persons in a given country inclined to pursue a direct selling business opportunity 
moreover  our growth will depend upon improved training and other activities that enhance distributor retention in our markets 
while we have recently experienced significant growth in certain of our markets  we cannot assure you that such growth levels will continue in the immediate or long term future 
furthermore  our efforts to support growth in such international markets could be hampered to the extent that our infrastructure in such markets is deficient when compared to our more developed markets  such as the us therefore  we cannot assure you that our general efforts to increase our market penetration and distributor retention in existing markets will be successful 
if we are unable to continue to expand into new markets or further penetrate existing markets  our operating results would suffer 
our contractual obligation to sell our products only through our herbalife distributor network and to refrain from changing certain aspects of our marketing plan may limit our growth 
we are a party to an agreement with our distributors that provides assurances that a change in ownership will not negatively affect certain aspects of their business 
through this agreement  we committed to our distributors that we will not sell herbalife products through any distribution channel other than our network of independent herbalife distributors 
thus  we are contractually prohibited from expanding our business by selling herbalife products through other distribution channels that may be available to our competitors  such as over the internet  through wholesale sales  by establishing retail stores or through mail order systems 
since this is an open ended commitment  there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of innovative new distribution channels that are developed in the future 
in addition  our agreement with our distributors provides that we will not change certain aspects of our marketing plan without the consent of a specified percentage of our distributors 
for example  our agreement with our distributors provides that we may increase  but not decrease  the discount percentages available to our distributors for the purchase of products or the applicable royalty override percentages  including roll ups  and production and other bonus percentages available to our distributors at various qualification levels within our distributor hierarchy 
we may not modify the eligibility or qualification criteria for these discounts  royalty overrides and production and other bonuses unless we do so in a manner to make eligibility and or qualification easier than under the applicable criteria in effect as of the date of the agreement 
our agreement with our distributors further provides that we may not vary the criteria for qualification for each distributor tier within our distributor hierarchy  unless we do so in such a way so as to make qualification easier 
although we reserved the right to make these changes to our marketing plan without the consent of our distributors in the event that changes are required by applicable law or are necessary in our reasonable business judgment to account for specific local market or currency conditions to achieve a reasonable profit on operations  there can be no assurance that our agreement with our distributors will not restrict our ability to adapt our marketing plan to the evolving requirements of the markets in which we operate 
as a result  our growth may be limited 
we depend on the integrity and reliability of our information technology infrastructure  and any related inadequacies may result in substantial interruptions to our business 
our ability to timely provide products to our distributors and their customers  and services to our distributors  depends on the integrity of our information technology system  which we are in the process of upgrading  including the reliability of software and services supplied by our vendors 
we are implementing an oracle enterprise wide technology solution  a scalable and stable open architecture platform  to enhance our and our distributors efficiency and productivity 
in addition  we are upgrading our internet based marketing and distributor services platform  myherbalife 
com 
the most important aspect of our information technology infrastructure is the system through which we record and track distributor sales  volume points  royalty overrides  bonuses and other incentives 
we have encountered  and may encounter in the future  errors in our software or our enterprise network  or inadequacies in the software 
table of contents and services supplied by our vendors  although to date none of these errors or inadequacies has had a meaningful adverse impact on our business 
any such errors or inadequacies that we may encounter in the future may result in substantial interruptions to our services and may damage our relationships with  or cause us to lose  our distributors if the errors or inadequacies impair our ability to track sales and pay royalty overrides  bonuses and other incentives  which would harm our financial condition and operating results 
such errors may be expensive or difficult to correct in a timely manner  and we may have little or no control over whether any inadequacies in software or services supplied to us by third parties are corrected  if at all 
since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products  if these third parties fail to reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality  then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
all of our products are manufactured by outside companies  except for a small amount of products manufactured in our own manufacturing facility in china 
we cannot assure you that our outside manufacturers will continue to reliably supply products to us at the levels of quality  or the quantities  we require  especially under the fda s recently adopted cgmp regulations 
our supply contracts generally have a two year term 
except for force majeure events such as natural disasters and other acts of god  and non performance by herbalife  our manufacturers generally cannot unilaterally terminate these contracts 
these contracts can generally be extended by us at the end of the relevant time period and we have exercised this right in the past 
globally we have over suppliers of our products 
for our major products  we have both primary and secondary suppliers 
our major suppliers include nature s bounty for protein powders  fine foods italy for protein powders and nutritional supplements  pharmachem labs for teas and niteworks and jb labs for fiber 
in the event any of our third party manufacturers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products in required volumes and at suitable quality levels  we would be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement manufacturing sources 
there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative manufacturing sources on a timely basis 
an extended interruption in the supply of products would result in the loss of sales 
in addition  any actual or perceived degradation of product quality as a result of reliance on third party manufacturers may have an adverse effect on sales or result in increased product returns and buybacks 
if we fail to protect our trademarks and tradenames  then our ability to compete could be negatively affected  which would harm our financial condition and operating results 
the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademark and tradenames 
we own  or have licenses to use  the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging  marketing and distribution of our products in the markets where those products are sold 
therefore  trademark and trade name protection is important to our business 
although most of our trademarks are registered in the united states and in certain foreign countries in which we operate  we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the loss or infringement of our trademarks or tradenames could impair the goodwill associated with our brands and harm our reputation  which would harm our financial condition and operating results 
unlike in most of the other markets in which we operate  limited protection of intellectual property is available under chinese law 
accordingly  we face an increased risk in china that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our trademarks  copyrights  product formulations or other intellectual property 
further  since chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped  we may have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter significant difficulties with intellectual property theft or infringement 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our product formulations or other intellectual property 
we permit the limited use of our trademarks by our independent distributors to assist them in the marketing of our products 
it is possible that doing so may increase the risk of unauthorized use or misuse of our trademarks in markets where their registration status differs from that asserted by our independent distributors  or they may be used in association with claims or products in a manner not permitted under applicable laws and regulations 
were 
table of contents this to occur it is possible that this could diminish the value of these marks or otherwise impair our further use of these marks 
if our distributors fail to comply with labeling laws  then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
although the physical labeling of our products is not within the control of our independent distributors  our distributors must nevertheless advertise our products in compliance with the extensive regulations that exist in certain jurisdictions  such as the united states  which considers product advertising to be labeling for regulatory purposes 
our products are sold principally as foods  dietary supplements and cosmetics and are subject to rigorous fda and related legal regimens limiting the types of therapeutic claims that can be made for our products 
the treatment or cure of disease  for example  is not a permitted claim for these products 
while we train and attempt to monitor our distributors marketing materials  we cannot ensure that all such materials comply with applicable regulations  including bans on therapeutic claims 
if our distributors fail to comply with these restrictions  then we and our distributors could be subjected to claims  financial penalties  mandatory product recalls or relabeling requirements  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
although we expect that our responsibility for the actions of our independent distributors in such an instance would be dependent on a determination that we either controlled or condoned a noncompliant advertising practice  there can be no assurance that we could not be held vicariously responsible for the actions of our independent distributors 
if our intellectual property is not adequate to provide us with a competitive advantage or to prevent competitors from replicating our products  or if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
our future success and ability to compete depend upon our ability to timely produce innovative products and product enhancements that motivate our distributors and customers  which we attempt to protect under a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
however  our products are generally not patented domestically or abroad  and the legal protections afforded by common law and contractual proprietary rights in our products provide only limited protection and may be time consuming and expensive to enforce and or maintain 
further  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our proprietary rights or from independently developing non infringing products that are competitive with  equivalent to and or superior to our products 
monitoring infringement and or misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive  and we may not be able to detect any infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights 
even if we do detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights  litigation to enforce these rights could cause us to divert financial and other resources away from our business operations 
further  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
additionally  third parties may claim that products we have independently developed infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
for example  in a recently settled lawsuit unither pharma  inc and others had alleged that sales by herbalife international of its niteworks and prelox blue products and its former products woman s advantage with dhea and optimum performance infringed on patents that are licensed to or owned by those parties 
although we do not believe that we are infringing on any third party intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that one or more of our products will not be found to infringe upon other third party intellectual property rights in the future 
since one of our products constitutes a significant portion of our retail sales  significant decreases in consumer demand for this product or our failure to produce a suitable replacement should we cease offering it would harm our financial condition and operating results 
our formula meal replacement product constitutes a significant portion of our sales  accounting for approximately and of retail sales for the fiscal years ended december   and 
table of contents respectively 
if consumer demand for this product decreases significantly or we cease offering this product without a suitable replacement  then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
if we lose the services of members of our senior management team  then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
we depend on the continued services of our chairman and chief executive officer  michael o 
johnson  and our current senior management team 
the relationships that they have developed with our senior distributor leadership  especially in light of the high level of turnover in our former senior management team and the resulting need to reestablish good working relationships with our senior distributor leadership after the death of our founder in may although we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team  and do not believe that any of them are planning to leave or retire in the near term  we cannot assure you that our senior managers will remain with us 
the loss or departure of any member of our senior management team could adversely impact our distributor relations and operating results 
if any of these executives do not remain with us  our business could suffer 
also  the loss of key personnel  including our regional and country managers  could negatively impact our ability to implement our business strategy  and our continued success will also be dependent on our ability to retain existing  and attract additional  qualified personnel to meet our needs 
we currently do not maintain key person life insurance with respect to our senior management team 
the covenants in our existing indebtedness limit our discretion with respect to certain business matters  which could limit our ability to pursue certain strategic objectives and in turn harm our financial condition and operating results 
our credit facility contains numerous financial and operating covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things pay dividends  redeem share capital or capital stock and make other restricted payments and investments  incur additional debt or issue preferred shares  impose dividend or other distribution restrictions on our subsidiaries  create liens on our and our subsidiaries assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  guarantee other indebtedness  and merge  consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios and financial conditions 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default causing all amounts to become due and payable under our credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets  which the lenders thereunder could proceed to foreclose against 
if we do not comply with transfer pricing  customs duties  and similar regulations  then we may be subjected to additional taxes  duties  interest and penalties in material amounts  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
as a multinational corporation  in many countries including the united states we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that our intercompany transactions are consummated at prices that have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result  that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our united states or local entities  and that we are taxed appropriately on such transactions 
in addition  our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products 
we are currently subject to pending or proposed audits that are at various levels of review  assessment or appeal in a number of jurisdictions involving transfer pricing issues  income taxes  customs duties  value added taxes  withholding taxes  sales and use and other taxes and related interest and penalties in 
table of contents material amounts 
in one such case we are currently appealing a tax assessment in spain 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses 
further  in some circumstances  additional taxes  interest and penalties have been assessed and we will be required to pay the assessments or post surety  in order to challenge the assessments 
we have reserved in the consolidated financial statements an amount that we believe represents the most likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes  but if we are incorrect in our assessment we may have to pay the full amount asserted 
ultimate resolution of these matters may take several years  and the outcome is uncertain 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge our transfer pricing practices or our positions regarding the payment of income taxes  customs duties  value added taxes  withholding taxes  sales and use  and other taxes  we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 
we may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our distributors  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our distributors are subject to taxation  and in some instances  legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes  such as value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate records 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors 
in the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent distributors as employees  or that our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations  we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes those jurisdictions  plus any related assessments and penalties  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we may incur material product liability claims  which could increase our costs and harm our financial condition and operating results 
our products consist of herbs  vitamins and minerals and other ingredients that are classified as foods or dietary supplements and are not subject to pre market regulatory approval in the united states 
our products could contain contaminated substances  and some of our products contain innovative ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption 
we generally do not conduct or sponsor clinical studies for our products and previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur 
as a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we have been  and may again be  subjected to various product liability claims  including that the products contain contaminants  the products include inadequate instructions as to their uses  or the products include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
it is possible that widespread product liability claims could increase our costs  and adversely affect our revenues and operating income 
moreover  liability claims arising from a serious adverse event may increase our costs through higher insurance premiums and deductibles  and may make it more difficult to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future 
in addition  our product liability insurance may fail to cover future product liability claims  thereby requiring us to pay substantial monetary damages and adversely affecting our business 
finally  given the higher level of self insured retentions that we have accepted under our current product liability insurance policies  which are as high as approximately million  in certain cases we may be subject to the full amount of liability associated with any injuries  which could be substantial 
several years ago  a number of states restricted the sale of dietary supplements containing botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids and on february   the fda banned the use of such ephedrine alkaloids 
until late  we had sold thermojetics original green herbal tablets  thermojetics green herbal tablets and thermojetics gold herbal tablets  all of which contained ephedrine alkaloids 
accordingly  we run the risk of product liability claims related to the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloids contained in those products 
currently  we have been named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits seeking to link the ingestion of certain of the aforementioned products to subsequent alleged medical problems suffered by plaintiffs 
although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the allegations contained in these lawsuits  and are vigorously defending these claims  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in our defense of any or all of these matters 

table of contents we are subject to  among other things  requirements regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in connection with these requirements  we conduct regular audits of our business and operations 
our failure to identify or correct deficiencies and areas of weakness in the course of these audits could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules and regulations adopted by the sec  the public company accounting oversight board and the new york stock exchange 
in particular  we are required to include management and auditor reports on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as part of our annual reports on form k  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules 
our failure to correct any noted weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting could result in the disclosure of material weaknesses which could have a material adverse effect upon the market value of our stock 
on a regular and on going basis  we conduct audits through our internal audit department of various aspects of our business and operations 
these internal audits are conducted to insure compliance with our policies and to strengthen our operations and related internal controls 
the audit committee of our board of directors regularly reviews the results of these internal audits and  when appropriate  suggests remedial measures and actions to correct noted deficiencies or strengthen areas of weakness 
there can be no assurance that these internal audits will uncover all material deficiencies or areas of weakness in our operations or internal controls 
if left undetected and uncorrected  such deficiencies and weaknesses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  the results of these internal audits may necessitate that we conduct further investigations into aspects of our business or operations 
at the time of the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   one such investigation was pending 
this investigation concerned certain activities related to one of our foreign subsidiaries and related matters  and involved possible violations of applicable law 
the then pending review of this investigation necessitated our filing of a request for extension on form b with the sec 
this investigation was completed in the fourth quarter of  and the audit committee of our board of directors has adopted  and we have implemented  a remediation plan in response to the related findings 
we believe the results of this investigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  our business practices and operations may periodically be investigated by one or more of the many governmental authorities with jurisdiction over our worldwide operations 
in the event that these investigations produce unfavorable results  we may be subjected to fines  penalties or loss of licenses or permits needed to operate in certain jurisdictions  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
holders of our common shares may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 
our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association  and by the companies law revision and the common law of the cayman islands 
the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states 
therefore  shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by our management or board of directors than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states  due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 
unlike many jurisdictions in the united states  cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company 
this may make it more difficult for shareholders to assess the value of any consideration they may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offer give shareholders additional consideration if they believe the consideration offered is insufficient 
shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as herbalife have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of our shareholders 
our directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine whether or not  and under what conditions  our 
table of contents corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders  but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders 
this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 
subject to limited exceptions  under cayman islands law  a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors 
maples and calder  our cayman islands counsel  has informed us that they are not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 
provisions of our articles of association and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover or make it more difficult for shareholders to change the direction or management of the company  which could reduce shareholders opportunity to influence management of the company 
our articles of association permit our board of directors to issue preference shares from time to time  with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate 
our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preference shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 
in addition  our articles of association contain certain other provisions which could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction or preventing or making it more difficult for shareholders to change the direction or management of our company  including a classified board  the inability of shareholders to act by written consent  a limitation on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and advance notice provisions 
as a result  our shareholders may have less input into the management of our company than they might otherwise have if these provisions were not included in our articles of association 
unlike many jurisdictions in the united states  cayman islands law does not provide for mergers as that term is understood under corporate law in the united states 
however  cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies  which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as schemes of arrangement 
the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states 
under cayman islands law and practice  a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands company must be approved at a shareholders meeting by each class of shareholders  in each case  by a majority of the number of holders of each class of a company s shares that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such a meeting  which holders must also represent in value of such class issued that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement 
the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation must also be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands 
although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement  the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise have a material adverse effect on the creditors interests 
furthermore  the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with  the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question  the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve  and the scheme or arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law 
there is uncertainty as to shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the cayman islands 
we are incorporated as an exempted company with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands 
a material portion of our assets are located outside of the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for our 
table of contents shareholders to enforce judgments against us or judgments obtained in us courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state of the united states 
we have been advised by our cayman islands counsel  maples and calder  that although there is no statutory enforcement in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states  the courts of the cayman islands will based on the principle that a judgment by a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given recognize and enforce a foreign judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction if such judgment is final  for a liquidated sum  not in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty  is not inconsistent with a cayman islands judgment in respect of the same matters  and was not obtained in a manner  and is not of a kind  the enforcement of which is contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
there is doubt  however  as to whether the grand court of the cayman islands will recognize or enforce judgments of us courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state of the united states  or in original actions brought in the cayman islands  impose liabilities predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state of the united states  on the grounds that such provisions are penal in nature 
the grand court of the cayman islands may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere

herbalife international and certain of its independent distributors have been named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit filed february   in the superior court of california  county of san francisco  and served on herbalife international on march  minton v 
herbalife international  et al 
the case has been transferred to the los angeles county superior court 
the plaintiff is challenging the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes  insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans  unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit 
the plaintiff alleges that the freedom group system operated by certain independent distributors of herbalife international products places too much emphasis on recruiting and encourages excessively large purchases of product and promotional materials by distributors 
the plaintiff also alleges that freedom group pressured distributors to disseminate misleading promotional materials 
the plaintiff seeks to hold 
table of contents herbalife international vicariously liable for the actions of its independent distributors and is seeking damages and injunctive relief 
on january   the superior court denied class certification of all claims  except for the claim under california law prohibiting endless chain schemes 
that claim was granted california only class certification  provided that class counsel is able to substitute in as a plaintiff a california resident with claims typical of the class 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the suit 
herbalife international and certain of its distributors were defendants in a class action lawsuit filed july   in the circuit court of ohio county in the state of west virginia mey v 
herbalife international  inc  et al 
the complaint alleged that certain telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violated the telephone consumer protection act  or tcpa  and sought to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of its independent distributors 
more specifically  the plaintiffs complaint alleged that several of herbalife international s distributors used pre recorded telephone messages and faxes to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpa s prohibition of such practices 
without in any way acknowledging liability or wrongdoing by us or our independent distributors  we and the other defendants have reached a binding settlement with the plaintiffs 
under the terms of the settlement the defendants collectively paid million into a fund to be distributed to qualifying class members 
the relevant amount paid by us was previously fully reserved in our financial statements 
the settlement has received the final approval of the court in january on september   the company was orally advised by the los angeles regional office of the sec that the sec had issued a formal order of investigation into the timing of trading in herbalife securities by a former mid level employee 
the company does not believe these trades involve the company itself 
in addition  on november   the company received a voluntary request for the production of documents from the staff of the los angeles regional office of the sec regarding the extent of personal use of herbalife products by the company s distributors and the company s related policies and procedures 
the sec has advised the company that its inquiry should not be construed as an adverse reflection on any person  the company or its common shares  or as an indication from the sec or its staff that any violation of law has occurred 
the company is cooperating fully with the staff of the sec in these matters 
as a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we have been and are currently subjected to various product liability claims 
the effects of these claims to date have not been material to us  and the reasonably possible range of exposure on currently existing claims is not material to us 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the allegations contained in the lawsuits 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with an annual deductible of million 
certain of our subsidiaries have been subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in their respective countries 
in certain of these tax audits  governmental authorities are proposing that significant amounts of additional taxes and related interest and penalties are due 
we and our tax advisors believe that there are substantial defenses to their allegations that additional taxes are owed  and we are vigorously contesting the additional proposed taxes and related charges 
these matters may take several years to resolve  and we cannot be sure of their ultimate resolution 
however  it is the opinion of management that adverse outcomes  if any  will not likely result in a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
this opinion is based on our belief that any losses we suffer would not be material and that we have meritorious defenses 
although we have reserved an amount that we believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes  if we are incorrect in our assessment  we may have to record additional expenses

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  each included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global network marketing company that sells weight management  nutritional supplement  energy fitness products and personal care products 
we pursue our mission of changing people s lives by providing a financially rewarding business opportunity to distributors and quality products to distributors and their customers who seek a healthy lifestyle 
we are one of the largest network marketing companies in the world with net sales of approximately billion for the year ended december  we sell our products in countries through a network of over million independent distributors except in china  where we sell our products through retail stores and an employed sales force 
we believe the quality of our products and the effectiveness of our distribution network  coupled with geographic expansion  have been the primary reasons for our success throughout our year operating history 
during the quarter ended june   we reorganized our product categories to better reflect how our distributors sell products and programs 
our products are grouped in four principal categories weight management  targeted nutrition  energy fitness products and outer nutrition 
our products are often sold in programs that are comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for consumers and maximize our distributors cross selling opportunities 
industry wide factors that affect us and our competitors include the increasing prevalence of obesity and the aging of the worldwide population  which are driving demand for nutrition and wellness related products and the recruitment and retention of distributors 
the opportunities and challenges upon which we are most focused are retailing of our products  recruitment and retention of distributors  improving distributor productivity  new markets  further penetrating existing markets including china  globalizing successful distributor methods of operation such as nutrition clubs  introducing new products  developing niche market segments and further investing in our infrastructure 
in late  we changed our geographic regions from seven to five regions as part of our on going realignment for growth plan 
this updated regional structure allows us to better support the distributor leadership and enhance synergies within the regions 
under the new geographic regions  we report revenue from north america  which consists of the us  canada and jamaica  mexico and central america  which consists of mexico  costa rica  el salvador  panama and dominican republic  south america  including brazil  emea  which consists of europe  the middle east and africa  and asia pacific  including countries in the former greater china  north asia and south east asia regions 
historical information presented in this annual report on form k relating to our geographic regions has been reclassified to conform with our current geographic presentation 
volume points by geographic region a key non financial measure we focus on is volume points on a royalty basis  or volume points  which is essentially our weighted unit measure of product sales volume 
it is a useful measure for us  as it excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and ignores the differences generated by varying retail pricing across geographic markets 
in general  an increase in volume points in a particular geographic region or country indicates an increase in local currency net sales 

table of contents for the year ended december  change change change volume points in millions north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific worldwide number of new sales leaders by geographic region during the reporting period another key non financial measure on which we focus is the number of distributors qualified as new sales leaders under our compensation system 
excluding china  distributors qualify for supervisor status based on their volume points 
the growth in the number of new sales leaders is a general indicator of the level of distributor recruitment  which generally drives net sales in a particular country or geographic region 
full year december  change change change north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific excluding china total new supervisors new china sales employees  n m   worldwide total new sales leaders number of supervisors and retention rates by geographic region as of requalification period our compensation system requires each supervisor to re qualify for such status each year  prior to february  in order to maintain their discount on product and be eligible to receive royalty payments 
in february of each year  we demote from the rank of supervisor those distributors who did not satisfy the supervisor re qualification requirements during the preceding twelve months 
the re qualification requirement does not apply to new supervisors ie those who became supervisors subsequent to the january re qualification of the prior year 
supervisor statistics excluding china in thousands january total supervisors january february new supervisors demoted supervisors did not requalify other supervisors resigned  etc end of february total supervisors 
table of contents the distributor statistics below further highlight the calculation for retention 
supervisor retention excluding china in thousands supervisors needed to requalify demoted supervisors did not requalify total requalified retention rate the table below reflects the number of sales leaders as of february subsequent to the annual re qualification date and supervisor retention rate by year and by region 
number of sales leaders supervisors retention rate north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific excluding china total supervisors china sales employees worldwide total sales leaders the number of supervisors by geographic region as of the quarterly reporting dates will normally be higher than the number of supervisors by geographic region as of the requalification period because supervisors who do not re qualify during the relevant twelve month period will be dropped from the rank of supervisor the following february 
since supervisors purchase most of our products for resale to other distributors and consumers  comparisons of supervisor totals on a year to year  same period basis are good indicators of our recruitment and retention efforts in different geographic regions 
the value of the average monthly purchase of herbalife products by our sales leaders has remained relatively constant over time 
consequently  increases in our sales are driven primarily by our retention of supervisors and by our recruitment and retention of distributors  rather than through increases in the productivity of our overall supervisor base 
we provide distributors with products  support materials  training  special events and a competitive compensation program 
if a distributor wants to pursue the herbalife business opportunity  the distributor is responsible for growing his or her business and personally pays for the sales activities related to attracting new customers and recruiting distributors by hosting events such as herbalife opportunity meetings or success training seminars  by advertising herbalife s products  by purchasing and using promotional materials such as t shirts  buttons and caps  by utilizing and paying for direct mail and print material such as brochures  flyers  catalogs  business cards  posters and banners and telephone book listings  by purchasing inventory for sale or use as samples  and by training  mentoring and following up in person or via the phone or internet with customers and recruits on how to use herbalife products and or pursue the herbalife business opportunity 
presentation retail sales represent the gross sales amounts on our invoices to distributors before distributor allowances  as defined below  and net sales  which reflect distribution allowances and handling and freight income  represent what we collect and recognize as net sales in our financial statements 
we discuss retail sales because of its fundamental role in our compensation systems  internal controls and operations  including its role as the basis upon which distributor discounts  royalties and bonuses are awarded 
in addition  it is used as the basis for certain information included in daily and monthly reports reviewed by our management 
however  such a measure is not in 
table of contents accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
you should not consider retail sales in isolation from  nor as a substitute for  net sales and other consolidated income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
a reconciliation of net sales to retail sales is presented below under results of operations 
product sales represent the actual product purchase price paid to us by our distributors  after giving effect to distributor discounts referred to as distributor allowances  which approximate of retail sales prices 
distributor allowances as a percentage of retail sales may vary by country depending upon regulatory restrictions that limit or otherwise restrict distributor allowances 
our gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales  which represents the prices we pay to our raw material suppliers and manufacturers of our products as well as costs related to product shipments  duties and tariffs  freight expenses relating to shipment of products to distributors and importers and similar expenses 
royalty overrides are our most significant expense and consist of royalty overrides and production bonuses which total approximately and  respectively  of the retail sales of weight management  targeted nutrition  energy fitness  outer nutrition and promotional products  the mark hughes bonus payable to some of our most senior distributors in the aggregate amount of up to of retail sales of weight management  targeted nutrition  energy fitness and outer nutrition  and other discretionary incentive cash bonuses to qualifying distributors 
royalty overrides are generally earned based on retail sales and approximate in the aggregate about of retail sales or approximately of our net sales 
royalty overrides together with distributor allowances represent the potential earnings to distributors of up to approximately of retail sales 
the compensation to distributors is generally for the development  retention and improved productivity of their distributor sales organizations and is paid to several levels of distributors on each sale 
due to restrictions on direct selling in china  our full time employed sales representatives in china are compensated with wages  bonuses and benefits instead of the distributors earnings  distributor allowances and royalty overrides 
because of local country regulatory constraints  we may be required to modify our typical distributor incentive plans as described above 
consequently  the total distributor discount percentage may vary over time 
we also offer reduced distributor allowances and pay reduced royalty overrides with respect to certain products worldwide 
our operating margins consist of net sales less cost of sales and royalty overrides 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent our operating expenses  components of which include labor and benefits  sales events  professional fees  travel and entertainment  distributor marketing  occupancy costs  communication costs  bank fees  depreciation and amortization  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
most of our sales to distributors outside the united states are made in the respective local currencies 
in preparing our financial statements  we translate revenues into us dollars using average exchange rates 
additionally  the majority of our purchases from our suppliers generally are made in us dollars 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margins and can generate transaction losses on intercompany transactions 
throughout the last five years  foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly 
from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk as discussed in further detail in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk summary financial results net sales for the year ended december  increased to  million from  million in the increase was primarily due to growth in several of the company s top countries including  the us  china  venezuela and taiwan with increases of   and  respectively  as compared to the increase in these markets reflects strong supervisor growth  the continued success of our distributors with various operating methods like the nutrition club dmo and lead generation sampling dmo  and an increase in the number of stores in china 
the opening of peru in december as a new market also contributed to the sales 
table of contents growth 
overall  the appreciation of foreign currencies had a million favorable impact on net sales in  representing about of the total sales increase 
net income for the year ended december  increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the increase was driven by revenue growth in many of our markets  expansion in operating profit margins and reduction in interest expense following a debt refinancing in july  partially offset by higher labor costs  depreciation expense and foreign exchange losses 
net income for included an unfavorable after tax impact of million from the completion of the first phase and start of the second phase of our realignment for growth plan  an increase in tax reserves of million and a million net tax benefit resulting from various international tax settlements 
net income for included million additional interest expense related to our refinancing arrangements in july  a million tax benefit resulting from an international tax settlement  a million additional tax benefit from refinancing transactions  a million favorable impact of the adjustment to income tax accrual and a million unfavorable after tax impact in connection with the realignment for growth plan in the fourth quarter of the amounts for were partially offset by a million expense in connection with the adoption of the new accounting rules for stock based compensation and a million charge for the continued build out of infrastructure in china 
results of operations our results of operations for the periods described below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods  which depend upon numerous factors  including our ability to recruit new distributors and retain existing distributors  open new markets  further penetrate existing markets  introduce new products and programs that will help our distributors increase their retail efforts and develop niche market segments 
the following table sets forth selected results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

management s role  both in country and at the corporate level is to provide distributors with a competitive and broad product line  encourage strong teamwork and leadership among the chairman s club and president s team distributors and offer leading edge business tools to make doing business with herbalife simple 
management uses the distributor marketing program coupled with educational and motivational tools and promotions to incentivize distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing  which in turn affect net sales 
such tools include company sponsored sales events such as extravaganzas and world team schools where large groups of distributors gather  thus allowing them to network with other distributors  learn recruiting  retention and retailing techniques from our leading distributors and become more familiar with how to market and sell our products and business opportunities 
accordingly  management believes that these development and motivation programs can increase the productivity of the supervisor network 
the expenses for such programs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales are driven by several factors  including the number and productivity of distributors and supervisors who continually build  educate and motivate their respective distribution and sales organizations 
we also use event and non event product promotions to motivate distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing activities 
these promotions have prizes ranging from qualifying for events to product prizes and vacations 
the costs of these promotions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the factors described above have helped distributors increase their business  which in turn has driven growth in our business 
the discussion below of net sales by geographic region further details some of the above factors and describes unique growth factors specific to certain major countries 
we believe that the correct business foundation  coupled with ongoing training and promotional initiatives  is required to increase recruiting and retention of distributors and retailing our products 
the correct business foundation includes strong country management that works closely with the distributor leadership  unified distributor leadership  a broad product line that appeals to local consumer needs  a favorable regulatory environment  a scalable and stable technology platform and an attractive distributor marketing plan 
initiatives  such as success training seminars  world team schools  promotional events and regional extravaganzas  are integral components of developing a highly motivated and educated distributor sales organization that will work toward increasing the recruitment and retention of distributors 
our strategy will continue to include creating and maintaining growth within existing markets  while expanding into new markets 
we expect to increase our spending in selling  general and administrative expenses to maintain or stimulate sales growth  while making strategic investments in new initiatives and in new markets 
in addition  new ideas and dmos are being generated in our regional markets and globalized where applicable  either 
table of contents by distributors  country management or corporate management 
examples of dmos include the nutrition clubs in mexico  the total plan in brazil  the wellness coach in france and the lead generation sampling in the us management s strategy is to review the applicability of expanding successful country initiatives throughout a region  and where appropriate  financially support the globalization of these initiatives

new supervisors in the region increased for the year ending december   as compared to the same period in this was led by new supervisor growth in the united states of

after experiencing explosive sales growth in through  was a re building year for mexico as the management team  in conjunction with the distributor leadership  addressed issues of infrastructure needs as well as distributor training 
infrastructure enhancements included introduction of sales centers and expansion of current distribution facilities  the addition of a toll free phone line  and enhanced ethical business practices or ebp resources 
there are now locations throughout mexico  an increase of locations and expansion of sales centers 
these additions were designed to provide additional distributor access points and support the expansion of our business 
in addition  the distributor leadership has invested significant time training other distributors on nutrition club operations and the marketing plan in mexico 
in central america  we opened el salvador  our th country  in february for the year  net sales in el salvador were million  making it the region s second largest market 
we believe the fiscal year net sales in mexico and central america should show year over year positive growth as a result of infrastructure enhancements  and better trained distributors driving penetration across mexico  and focusing on retailing and recruiting

in brazil  the region s largest market  the net sales decline was primarily due to distributors transitioning to a more balanced mix of recruiting  retailing and retention via the nutrition club dmo in an effort to build a more sustainable platform for long term growth 
also contributing to the sales decline was the fact that our senior distributor leadership in brazil focused on building new business in peru  which opened in december of and had net sales of million for year ending december  brazil hosted a southeastern extravaganza in december with over  distributors in attendance and launched three additional products within their unique green tea based outer care product line called soft green

royalty overrides royalty overrides as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december   as compared to in the same period of the decrease for the year ended december  was primarily due to changes in the mix of products and countries  and the increase in sales in china where compensation to our full time employee sales representatives is included in selling  general and administrative expenses as opposed to royalty overrides where it is included for all other distributors under our worldwide marking plan 
generally  this ratio varies slightly from period to period due to changes in the mix of products and countries because full royalty overrides are not paid on certain products and in certain countries 
due to the structure of our global compensation plan  we expect to see slight fluctuations in royalty overrides as a percent of net sales

the increases were partially offset by million lower professional fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars over levels reflecting general salary merit increases  continued investments in china  and various sales growth initiatives including sales events and promotions 
as a result of these initiatives  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales should remain at or below levels

management s role  both in country and at the corporate level is to provide distributors with a competitive and broad product line  encourage strong teamwork and leadership among the chairman s club and president s team distributors and offer leading edge business tools to make doing business with herbalife simple 
management uses the distributor marketing program coupled with educational and motivational tools and promotions to incentivize distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing  which in turn affect net sales 
such tools include corporate sales events such as extravaganzas and world team schools where large groups of distributors gather  thus allowing them to network with other distributors  learn recruiting  retention and retailing techniques from our leading distributors and become more familiar with how to market and sell our products and business opportunities 
accordingly  management believes that these development and motivation programs can increase the productivity of the supervisor network 
the expenses for such programs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales are driven by several factors  including the number and productivity of distributors and supervisors who continually build  educate and motivate their respective distribution and sales organizations 
we also use event and non event product promotions to motivate distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing activities 
these promotions have prizes ranging from qualifying for events to prizes and vacations 
the costs of these promotions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the factors described above have helped distributors increase their business  which in turn has driven growth in our business 
the following net sales by geographic region discussion further details some of the above factors and describes unique growth factors specific to certain major countries 
we believe that the correct business foundation  coupled with ongoing training and promotional initiatives is required to increase recruiting and retention of distributors and retailing our products 
the correct business foundation includes strong country management that works closely with the distributor leadership  unified distributor leadership  a broad product line that appeals to local consumer needs  a favorable regulatory environment  a scalable and stable technology platform and an attractive distributor marketing plan 
initiatives such as success training seminars  world team schools  promotional events and regional extravaganzas are integral components of developing a highly motivated and educated distributor sales organization that will work toward increasing the recruitment and retention of distributors

the improved retention rate was caused by an increase in the number of distributors taking advantage of the modified re qualification criteria

due to the launch of these products together with the continued positive sales momentum discussed above  net sales of weight management products and targeted nutrition products increased at a higher rate than that for the entire company

there can be no assurance  however  that our business will service our debt  or fund our other liquidity needs 
the majority of our purchases from suppliers are generally made in us dollars  while sales to our distributors generally are made in local currencies 
consequently  strengthening of the us dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on operating margins and can generate transaction losses on intercompany transactions

table of contents contingencies we are from time to time engaged in routine litigation 
we regularly review all pending litigation matters in which we are involved and establish reserves deemed appropriate by management for these litigation matters when a probable loss estimate can be made 
herbalife international and certain of its independent distributors have been named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit filed february   in the superior court of california  county of san francisco  and served on herbalife international on march  minton v 
herbalife international  et al 
the case has been transferred to the los angeles county superior court 
the plaintiff is challenging the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes  insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans  unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit 
the plaintiff alleges that the freedom group system operated by certain independent distributors of herbalife international products places too much emphasis on recruiting and encourages excessively large purchases of product and promotional materials by distributors 
the plaintiff also alleges that freedom group pressured distributors to disseminate misleading promotional materials 
the plaintiff seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the actions of its independent distributors and is seeking damages and injunctive relief 
on january   the superior court denied class certification of all claims  except for the claim under california law prohibiting endless chain schemes 
that claim was granted california only class certification  provided that class counsel is able to substitute in as a plaintiff a california resident with claims typical of the class 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the suit 
herbalife international and certain of its distributors were defendants in a class action lawsuit filed july   in the circuit court of ohio county in the state of west virginia mey v 
herbalife international  inc  et al 
the complaint alleged that certain telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violated the telephone consumer protection act  or tcpa  and sought to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of its independent distributors 
more specifically  the plaintiffs complaint alleged that several of herbalife international s distributors used pre recorded telephone messages and faxes to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpa s prohibition of such practices 
without in any way acknowledging liability or wrongdoing by us or our independent distributors  we and the other defendants reached a binding settlement with the plaintiffs 
under the terms of the settlement  the defendants collectively paid million into a fund to be distributed to qualifying class members 
the relevant amount paid by us was previously fully reserved in our financial statements 
the settlement has received the final approval of the court in january as a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we have been and are currently subjected to various product liability claims 
the effects of these claims to date have not been material to us  and the reasonably possible range of exposure on currently existing claims is not material to us 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the allegations contained in the lawsuits 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with an annual deductible of million 
certain of our subsidiaries have been subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in their respective countries 
in certain of these tax audits  governmental authorities are proposing that significant amounts of additional taxes and related interest and penalties are due 
we and our tax advisors believe that there are substantial defenses to their allegations that additional taxes are owed  and we are vigorously contesting the additional proposed taxes and related charges 
these matters may take several years to resolve  and we cannot be sure of their ultimate resolution 
however  it is the opinion of management that adverse outcomes  if any  will not likely result in a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
this opinion is based on our belief that any losses we suffer would not be material and that we have meritorious defenses 
although we have reserved an amount that we believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes  if we are incorrect in our assessment  we may have to record additional expenses 

table of contents subsequent events on january   the company issued a press release announcing that mr 
peter maslen  a class iii member of the board of directors  communicated his decision to retire from the board of directors effective as of the close of business on january  the company also announced that the board of directors elected mr 
hal gaba to fill the vacancy created by mr 
maslen s retirement  effective as of the close of business on january  on january   the company s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of per common share to shareholders of record effective february   payable on march  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we are a network marketing company that sells a wide range of weight management products  nutritional supplements and personal care products within one industry segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas no 
our products are manufactured by third party providers and then sold to independent distributors who sell herbalife products to retail consumers or other distributors 
we sell products in countries throughout the world and we are organized and managed by geographic region 
in the first quarter of  we elected to aggregate our operating segments into one reporting segment  as management believes that our operating segments have similar operating characteristics and similar long term operating performance 
in making this determination  management believes that the operating segments are similar in the nature of the products sold  the product acquisition process  the types of customers products are sold to  the methods used to distribute the products  and the nature of the regulatory environment 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the independent distributor or importer 
amounts billed for freight and handling costs are included in net sales 
we generally receive the net sales price in cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale 
related royalty overrides and allowances for product returns are recorded when the merchandise is shipped 
allowances for product returns  primarily in connection with our buyback program  are provided at the time the product is shipped 
this accrual is based upon historic return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern  which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to months following the original sale 
historically  product returns and buybacks have not been significant 
product returns and buybacks were approximately of retail sales for the years ended december   and no material changes in estimates have been recognized for the years ended december   and we record reserves against our inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional reserves could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously reserved for inventory is sold 
we reserved for obsolete and slow moving inventory totaling million  million and million as of december   and respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the 
table of contents balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangibles not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles 
as of december   we had goodwill of approximately million  and marketing franchise of million 
goodwill was reduced in by approximately million due primarily to the effect of the settlement of an international tax audit related to the pre acquisition period and the realization of pre acquisition net operating losses 
contingencies are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use judgment 
many of these legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved 
generally  as the time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved  the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases 
deferred income tax assets have been established for net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and have been reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect them at amounts estimated to be ultimately realized 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts over a future period of time 
realization of the income tax carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the income tax carryforwards will be realized 
the amount of the income tax carryforwards that is considered realizable  however  could change if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are adjusted 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock award exercise behaviors 
our expected volatility is primarily based upon the historical volatility of our common shares and  due to the limited period of public trading data for our common shares  it is also validated against the volatility of a company peer group 
the expected life of awards is based on observed historical exercise patterns  which can vary over time 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
fin addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest 
table of contents benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the impact of the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which arise during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted  established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the underlying hedged item are recognized concurrently in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income  or oci  and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings

a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and derivatives is presented below 
foreign exchange risk we enter into foreign exchange derivatives in the ordinary course of business primarily to reduce exposure to currency fluctuations attributable to intercompany transactions and translation of local currency revenue 
all of these foreign exchange contracts are designated as free standing derivatives for which hedge accounting does not apply 
we purchase average rate put options  which give us the right  but not the obligation  to sell foreign currency at a specified exchange rate  or strike rate 
these contracts provide protection in the event that the foreign currency weakens beyond the option strike rate 
we also enter into various forward extra contracts a combination of a foreign forward exchange contract and an option  which provide protection against adverse market movement at a strike rate slightly worse than the forward and participate in favorable currency move up to a predetermined trigger level 
we are only obliged to sell foreign currency at the strike rate when the spot exchange rate is traded at or above the trigger rate 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding option contracts 
foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge advances between subsidiaries 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency movements on the subsidiary s operating results 
we also purchased ratio forward contracts which protect against adverse market movement at a rate better than the current forward 
the fair value of forward contracts is based on third party bank quotes 
all of our foreign exchange forward contracts have a maturity of less than one year with the majority maturing within days or less as of december
