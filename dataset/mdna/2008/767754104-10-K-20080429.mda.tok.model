item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net loss for fiscal was  or per basic and diluted share  compared to net income for fiscal of million or net loss of per diluted share  and  million  or per diluted share in fiscal our operating results are described in detail in the results of operations section of this item however  some of the key factors that impacted our results in fiscal   and are summarized as follows income tax valuation allowance adjustments 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million 
the income tax expense was primarily due to a non cash increase of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
according to sfas no 
 a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  sfas precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
net income for fiscal and included non cash income tax benefits of million and  million  respectively  related to the recognition of net deferred tax assets as a result of the release of a tax valuation allowance 
based upon a review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we could generate sustainable consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future  we concluded at the end of fiscal that the majority of the net deferred tax assets would be recognized 
thus  pursuant to sfas no 
 we recorded a tax benefit during fiscal releasing a majority of the remaining valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of  million 
acquisition of brooks eckerd 
on june   we acquired all of the membership interests of jean coutu usa  the holding company for brooks eckerd  from jean coutu group  pursuant to the terms of the agreement dated august  as consideration for the acquisition  we paid billion in cash and issued million shares of rite aid common stock 
we financed our cash payment via the establishment of a new term loan facility  issuance of senior notes and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 
as part of the arrangement of the financing necessary to complete the acquisition  we incurred a million fee for bridge financing that ultimately was not needed 
this fee was recorded as an acquisition related financing commitment charge in our statement of operations for fiscal as of march   jean coutu group owns million shares of rite aid common stock  which represents approximately of the total rite aid voting power 
we expanded our board of directors to members  with four of the seats being held by members designated by the jean coutu group 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a stockholder agreement the stockholder agreement with jean coutu group and certain family members 
the stockholder agreement contains provisions relating to jean coutu group s ownership interest in the company  board and board committee composition  corporate governance  stock ownership  stock purchase rights  transfer restrictions  voting arrangements and other matters 
we have also entered into a registration rights agreement with jean coutu group giving jean coutu group certain rights with respect to the registration under the securities act of  as amended  of the shares of our common stock issued to jean coutu group or acquired by jean coutu group pursuant to certain stock purchase rights or open market rights under the stockholder agreement 
the brooks eckerd stores and distribution centers are being integrated in phases 
we have completed integrating the six distribution centers and are well on our way to completing systems conversions in all of the acquired stores by the end of may we have also begun the minor remodel phase of the brooks eckerd stores  which we expect to complete by october debt refinancing 
in fiscal years and  we took several steps to extend the terms of our debt  lower our interest rates and obtain more flexibility 
in fiscal  we issued our senior secured notes due january  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our senior secured notes due february we incurred a charge to call these notes prior to maturity and recorded a write off of unamortized debt issue costs 
these items totaled million  which was recorded as a loss on debt modification in fiscal in fiscal  we amended our senior secured credit facility to consist solely of a billion revolving credit facility  paid at maturity the remaining outstanding principal on two existing notes and completed the early redemption of another existing note 
as a result of amending our senior secured credit facility and the early redemption of an existing note  we recorded a loss on debt modification of million hurricane katrina 
on august   hurricane katrina made landfall in louisiana and proceeded to move through mississippi and alabama  causing one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the united states 
as a result of this disaster  we had to close stores  which resulted in lost inventory and fixed assets 
we also incurred repair and maintenance charges related to our clean up efforts 
in february  we entered into a final binding settlement of our claims under hurricane katrina with our insurance carriers 
as a result of this settlement  we recorded a gain in fiscal of million 
the portion of this gain related to reimbursement for lost and damaged fixed assets was million and was recorded as a gain on sale of assets and investments 
the portion relating to reimbursement for lost or damaged inventory was million and was recorded as a reduction of costs of goods sold 
the portion of this gain related to repair and maintenance and other clean up charges was million and was recorded as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
dilutive equity issuances 
at march   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options and preferred stock 
our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consist of the following strike price outstanding stock options a preferred stock total shares in thousands and under    to   and over   total issuable shares    a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million results of operations the results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  have been adjusted to reflect the operations of our stores in the las vegas market area as a discontinued operation  as the company has entered into an agreement to sell the prescription files and terminate the operations of these stores 
this disposition was announced on january  revenue and other operating data year ended march  weeks march  weeks march  weeks dollars in thousands revenues    revenue growth same store sales growth pharmacy sales growth same store pharmacy sales growth pharmacy sales as a of total sales third party sales as a of total pharmacy sales front end sales growth same store front end sales growth front end sales as a of total sales store data total stores beginning of period    new stores closed stores store acquisitions  net  total stores end of period    remodeled stores relocated stores same store sales for fiscal are calculated by comparing the week period ended march  with the week period ended march  revenues fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in revenue was driven primarily by the acquisition of brooks eckerd 
in addition  same store sales increased over the prior year 
this increase consisted of pharmacy same store sales increase and a increase in front end same store sales 
same store sales trends which do not include the results of the brooks eckerd stores are described in the following paragraphs 
we include in same store sales all stores that have been opened at least one year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocation stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed 
brooks eckerd store sales decreased from last year s comparable period due primarily to the expected impact of current and ongoing integration activities 
the brooks eckerd stores are being integrated in phases  and therefore integration activities are expected to have a negative impact on brooks eckerd store sales trends in future periods 
pharmacy same store sales increased  primarily driven by an increase in price per prescription and by same store prescription growth of 
in addition to favorable demographic trends  our script growth was positively impacted by medicare part d and by initiatives such as our focus on customer satisfaction  prescription file buys  our senior citizen loyalty program and the new and relocated store program 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in generic sales and lower reimbursement including lower reimbursement rates from the new medicare part d program 
the rate of same store pharmacy sales growth has declined from the previous year primarily due to a lower rate of new enrollment in the medicare part d program  a greater mix of generic prescriptions and a weaker cough  cold and flu season 
front end same store sales increased from the prior year  due to strong performance in core categories  such as over the counter and consumables and a higher percentage of promotional sales were offset somewhat by the impact of a difficult economic environment during the holiday season and a weaker cough  cold and flu season than in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by front end sales growth of and pharmacy sales growth of 
sales growth in front end and pharmacy was driven by increases in same store sales  which are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below  offset somewhat by the additional week in fiscal fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased due to same store prescription growth of and an increase in price per prescription 
in addition to favorable demographic trends  our script growth was positively impacted by medicare part d and by initiatives such as our focus on customer satisfaction  prescription file buys  our senior loyalty program  our health condition programs and the new and relocated store program 
these items were partially offset by an increase in generic sales  a milder cough  cold and flu season and lower reimbursement rates  including lower reimbursement rates from the medicare part d program 
fiscal front end same store sales increased  primarily as a result of strong performance in core categories  such as over the counter and health and beauty and an increase in sales driven by promotional activities 
these items were partially offset primarily by a decrease in photo and film sales and a milder cough  cold and flu season

the improvement in the pharmacy gross margin rate was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of generic drugs sold and a lower cost of generics partially offset by lower reimbursement rates and an increase in medicare part d sales as a percentage of total pharmacy sales 
the improvement in the front end gross margin rate was primarily due to an increase in vendor promotional support 
the reduction in lifo charges was primarily due to lower pharmacy product inflation than in the prior year 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in distribution expense as a percentage of sales  due to higher fuel costs and increases in other expenses not offset by productivity improvements 
gross margin rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin rate was primarily negatively impacted by a decline in front end gross margin rate  which was caused by a higher mix of promotional sales and a reduction in photo and film gross profit 
gross margin rate was also negatively impacted by the recording of a lifo charge of million in fiscal compared to a million charge in fiscal our pharmacy gross profit had a slight positive contribution to consolidated gross margin rate due to the increase in sales 
however  our pharmacy gross margin rate was down slightly 
although there was an increase in generic prescriptions and a reduction in pharmacy shrink  these positive factors were offset by a reduction in reimbursement rates  particularly from medicare part d prescriptions 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the integration of the brooks eckerd stores and distribution centers  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to increased intangible assets resulting from the preliminary allocation of the purchase price of brooks eckerd and an increase in rent and occupancy expense from new and relocated stores and the sale and leaseback of owned stores 
these increases were partially offset by expense control in other expense categories 
we will continue to incur expenses related to the integration of the brooks eckerd stores in fiscal sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenues  compared to in fiscal sg a was positively impacted by effective labor and expense control  offset by an increase in rent and occupancy expense from new and relocated stores and the sale leaseback of owned stores and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from capital expenditures related to prescription file buys and new and relocated stores 
also negatively impacting the comparison to fiscal was a million accrual reversal recorded in fiscal resulting from the united states attorney closing its investigation involving matters related to prior management s business practices 
store closing and impairment charges store closing and impairment charges consist of year ended march  weeks march  weeks march  weeks dollars in thousands impairment charges    store and equipment lease exit charges    impairment charges 
in fiscal   and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the impairment of long lived assets at   and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were identified for impairment as part of our on going store performance review at all of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close a specific store 
store and equipment lease exit charges 
in fiscal   and  we recorded charges for   and stores  respectively  to be closed or relocated under long term leases 
charges to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  are recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or favorable lease terminations 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
the increase in the store and equipment lease exit charge for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores closed and a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the store lease exit charge liability 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we assess stores for potential closure 
decisions to close stores in future periods would result in charges for store lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory  as well as impairment of assets at these stores 
interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to increased borrowings to fund the brooks eckerd acquisition and related integration activities partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest expense for decreased from due to an extra week in fiscal which was partially offset by slightly higher borrowings and slightly higher interest rates 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense of million and income tax benefits of million  and  million have been recorded for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal income tax expense included non cash income tax expense of million related to the increase of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the recognition of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect recognition of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
according to sfas no 
 a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  sfas no 
precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods 
the existence of negative evidence at march   was primarily the result of the recently completed acquisition of brooks eckerd and the impact on current year earnings due to planned integration and acquisition activities  compounded by the weakening economy during the later half of the year 
the fiscal income tax benefit included a non cash state tax benefit of million which primarily related to an increase in our state tax rate applied to the net deferred tax assets partially offset by a non cash state tax expense of million related to an increase in the valuation allowance 
the fiscal benefit was primarily comprised of a federal and state non cash income tax benefit of  million for the release of valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets that  at the time  had an expected future utilization 
that utilization was based upon an ongoing review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we could generate sustainable consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future 
we monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
we maintained a valuation allowance of  million and million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end and  respectively 
we underwent an ownership change for statutory tax purposes during fiscal  which resulted in a limitation on the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
this limitation was considered when determining the required level for the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources general we have five primary sources of liquidity i cash and cash equivalents  ii cash provided by operating activities  iii the sale of accounts receivable under our receivable securitization agreements  iv the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility and v sale leasebacks of owned property 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to provide funds for capital expenditures and the costs of integrating the brooks eckerd stores and distribution centers 
transactions credit facility our senior credit facility includes a billion revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
the interest rate can fluctuate depending on the amount of revolver availability  as specified in the senior secured credit facility 
we are required to pay fees of per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility become due and payable in september our ability to borrow under the senior secured credit facility is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of inventory and prescription files 
at march   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at march   we also had letters of credit outstanding against the revolving credit facility of million  which gave us additional borrowing capacity of million 
however  our senior secured notes due may and our senior secured notes due march limit the amount of secured debt we may incur in such a manner that we cannot fully draw our revolver 
this lien limitation is based upon the amount of outstanding inventory and accounts receivable that we have available under the borrowing base calculations in the note indentures and is more restrictive than our secured debt incurrence availability in the same bond indentures 
as of march   the lien limitations under the senior secured notes due may and our senior secured notes due march limited our additional borrowing capacity under our revolver to approximately million 
we currently have an outstanding consent solicitation to the holders of our senior secured notes due may and our senior secured notes due march to amend the note indentures which would allow us to incur an additional million of secured debt and thereby eliminate a mismatch between the debt and lien covenants in such indentures 
the tranche term loans currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
the interest rate can fluctuate depending on the amount of availability under our revolving credit facility  as specified in the senior secured credit facility 
the amounts outstanding under the tranche term loans become due and payable on september   or earlier  if there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility 
on june   we amended our senior secured credit facility  to establish a new senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of  million and borrowed the full amount thereunder 
a portion of the proceeds from the borrowings under this senior secured term loan the tranche term loans were used to fund the acquisition of brooks eckerd 
the tranche term loans will mature on june  and currently bears interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loans with the proceeds of asset dispositions subject to certain limitations  with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt subject to certain exceptions 
if at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility  prepayment of the tranche term loans may also be required 
the senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured second priority debt and unsecured debt in addition to borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and existing indebtedness  provided that not in excess of million of such secured second priority debt and unsecured debt shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to three months after september  the senior secured credit facility allows us to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt with a maturity beyond three months after september  the senior secured facility also allows for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity on or before june  and for the repurchase of debt with a maturity after june  if we maintain availability on the revolving credit facility of at least million 
the senior secured credit facility contains covenants  which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above  the payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens 
the senior secured credit facility also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  but only if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million 
the senior secured credit facility provides for events of default including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of million or any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity of such debt 
preferred stock transactions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we issued million shares of our series e mandatory convertible series e preferred stock series e preferred stock 
the series e preferred stock automatically converted into common stock on february  at a rate of common shares per preferred share  as determined by the adjusted applicable market value of our common stock as defined in the series e preferred stock agreement on the date of conversion 
the series e preferred stock conversion resulted in the issuance of million shares of our common stock to the holders of the series e preferred stock 
other debt transactions on june  we incurred billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the issue consisted of million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due our obligations under each series of notes are guaranteed fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally  by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our existing senior secured credit facility and our outstanding senior secured notes 
the notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured  unsubordinated debt 
the indentures governing the notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to  among other things  incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  purchase  redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt  make asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates  incur liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  provide subsidiary guarantees  make investments and merge or consolidate with any other persons 
sale leaseback transactions during fiscal we sold a total of owned stores to independent third parties 
net proceeds from these sales were million 
concurrent with these sales  we entered into agreements to lease the stores back from the purchasers over minimum lease terms of years 
we accounted for of these leases as operating leases and the remaining eight were accounted for using the financing method as these lease agreements contain a clause that allow the buyer to force us to repurchase the properties under certain conditions 
a gain on the sale of these stores of million was deferred and is being recorded over the minimum term of these leases 
transactions debt transactions in november  we entered into an amendment of our senior secured credit facility to permit the financing of the acquisition 
pursuant to the terms of the senior secured facility amendment  we established a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million and borrowed the full amount thereunder 
proceeds from the borrowings under the new senior secured term loan facility the tranche term loans were used to pay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  which had been used to repay  at maturity  the outstanding principal and accrued interest payable under our senior secured notes due september other transactions in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due these notes are unsubordinated obligations of rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness 
our obligations under the notes are guaranteed  subject to certain limitations  by subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under our senior secured credit facility and other secured notes 
the guarantees are secured  subject to the permitted liens  by shared second priority liens  with holders of our senior secured notes due and our senior secured notes due  granted by subsidiary guarantors on all their assets that secure the obligations under the senior secured credit facility  subject to certain exceptions 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes due contains covenant provisions that  among other things  include limitations on our ability to pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  incur debt  grant liens  sell assets and enter into sale leaseback transactions 
proceeds from this offering were used to repay outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and to fund the redemption of our senior secured notes due per the terms of the indenture that governed the senior secured notes due  we paid a premium to the noteholders of of par 
we recorded a loss on debt modification of million related to the early redemption of the senior secured notes due  which included the call premium and unamortized debt issue costs on the notes 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due these notes are unsecured 
the indenture governing the senior notes due contains provisions that  among other things  include limitations on our ability to pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  incur debt  grant liens  sell assets and enter into sale leaseback transactions 
the senior notes due are guaranteed  subject to certain limitations  by subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the senior secured credit facility 
proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in january  we paid at maturity the remaining outstanding principal amount of million of our notes due january we funded this payment with borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in december  we paid at maturity the remaining outstanding principal amount of million of our convertible notes due december we funded this payment with borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in september  we completed the early redemption of all of our outstanding million of our senior secured notes due september we funded this payment with borrowing under our revolving credit facility  which were subsequently repaid with borrowings of the tranche term loans 
sale leaseback transactions during fiscal  we sold a total of owned stores to independent third parties 
net proceeds from these sales were approximately million 
concurrent with these sales  we entered into agreements to lease the stores back from the purchasers over minimum lease terms of years 
we accounted for of these leases as operating leases and the remaining five leases were accounted for using the financing method  as these lease agreements contain a clause that allows the buyer to force us to purchase the properties under certain conditions 
subsequent to march   the clause that allowed the buyer to force us to repurchase the properties lapsed on four of the five leases 
therefore  these leases are now accounted for as operating leases 
transactions preferred stock transactions in fiscal  we issued million shares of series i mandatory convertible preferred stock series i preferred stock at an offering price of per share 
dividends on the series i preferred stock are per share per year  and are due and payable on a quarterly basis in either cash or common stock or a combination of both at our election 
the series i preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock on november  at a rate that is dependent upon the adjusted applicable market value of our common stock as defined in the series i certificate of designations 
if the adjusted applicable market value of our common stock is a share or higher at the conversion date  then the series i preferred stock is convertible at a rate of per share of our common stock for every share of series i preferred stock outstanding 
if the adjusted applicable market value of our common stock is less than or equal to per share at the conversion date  then the series i preferred stock is convertible at a rate of shares of our common stock for every share of series i preferred stock outstanding 
if the adjusted applicable market value of our common stock is between per share and per share at the conversion date  then the series i preferred stock is convertible into common stock at a rate that is between and per share 
the holder may convert shares of the series i preferred stock into common stock at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date at the rate of per share 
the series i preferred stock is also convertible at our option  but only if the adjusted applicable market value of our common stock exceeds 
if we are subject to a cash acquisition as defined in the certificate of designations prior to the mandatory conversion date  the holder may elect to convert the shares of series i preferred stock into shares of common stock using a conversion rate set forth in the certificate of designations 
the holder will also receive a payment equal to the present value of all scheduled dividends through the mandatory conversion date 
proceeds from the issuance of the series i preferred stock  along with borrowings under the revolver  were used to redeem all shares of our series f preferred stock  at of the liquidation preference of share 
we paid a premium to redeem the series f preferred stock of million 
sale leaseback transactions during fiscal  we sold a total of owned stores to independent third parties 
net proceeds from these sales were approximately million 
concurrent with these sales  we entered into agreements to lease the stores back from the purchasers over minimum lease terms of years 
we accounted for of these leases as operating leases and the remaining two leases were accounted for using the financing method  as these lease agreements contain a clause that allows the buyer to force us to purchase the properties under certain conditions 
subsequent to march   the clause that allowed the buyer to force us to repurchase the properties lapsed on one of the two leases 
therefore  this lease is now accounted for as an operating lease 
other transactions on december   we paid at maturity the remaining outstanding principal amount of million of our fixed rate senior notes due december on july   we completed the early redemption of all of our outstanding million aggregate principal amount of notes due july at their contractually determined early redemption price of plus accrued interest 
we funded this redemption with borrowings under our receivable securitization agreements 
we recorded a loss on debt modification of million related to this transaction 
on april   we paid at maturity the remaining outstanding principal amount of million of our senior notes due april off balance sheet obligations we maintain receivables securitization agreements with several multi seller asset backed commercial paper vehicles cpvs 
under the terms of the securitization agreements  we sell substantially all of our eligible third party pharmaceutical receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity spe and retain servicing responsibility 
the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person  including any of our affiliates 
these agreements provide for us to sell  and for the spe to purchase these receivables 
the spe then transfers an interest in these receivables to various cpvs 
the amount of transferred receivables outstanding at any one time is dependent upon a formula that takes into account such factors as default history  obligor concentrations and potential dilution securitization formula 
adjustments to this amount can occur on a weekly basis 
at march  and march   the total of outstanding receivables that have been transferred to the cpvs were million and million  respectively 
the following table details receivable transfer activity for the years presented in thousands year ended march  weeks march  weeks march  weeks average amount of outstanding receivables transferred  total receivable transfers    collections made by the company as part of the servicing arrangement on behalf of the cpvs    at march  and march   we retained an interest in the third party pharmaceutical receivables not transferred to the cpvs of million and million  respectively  inclusive of the allowance for uncollectible accounts  which is included in accounts receivable  net  on the consolidated balance sheet 
on september  we amended our securitization agreements 
as a result of this amendment the total amount of interest in receivables than can be transferred to the cpv was increased to million from million 
the ongoing program fee was decreased from the cpvs commercial paper rate which often approximates month libor plus to the cpvs commercial paper rate plus 
the liquidity fee was reduced from to 
rite aid guarantees certain performance obligations of our affiliates under the securitization agreements  which include continued servicing of such receivables  but does not guarantee the collectibility of the receivables and obligor creditworthiness 
the cpvs have a commitment to purchase that ends september with the option to annually extend the commitment to purchase 
should any of the cpvs fail to renew their commitment under these securitization agreements  we have access to a backstop credit facility  which is backed by the cpvs and which expires in september it is our intent to renew our receivables securitization agreements with the cpvs 
proceeds from the collections under the receivables securitization agreements are submitted to an independent trustee on a daily basis 
the trustee withholds any cash necessary to fund amounts owed to the cpvs as a result of such collections and  fund the cpvs when the securitization formula indicates a lesser amount of outstanding receivables transferred is warranted 
the remaining collections are swept to our corporate concentration account 
at march  and march   we had million and million of cash  respectively  that was restricted for the payment of trustee fees 
we have determined that the transactions meet the criteria for sales treatment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
additionally  we have determined that we do not hold a variable interest in the cpvs  pursuant to the guidance in fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and therefore have determined that de recognition of the transferred receivables is appropriate 
as of march   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than the receivables securitization agreements described above and operating leases  which are included in the table below 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table details the maturities of our indebtedness and lease financing obligations as of march   as well as other contractual cash obligations and commitments

represents commitments to purchase products from certain vendors 
obligations for income tax uncertainties pursuant to fin of approximately million are not included in the table above as we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by net proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization and a reduction in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable 
the increase in inventory was primarily caused by brooks eckerd integration activities 
integration activities that require a temporary investment in inventory include replacing non go forward inventory  increasing the number of sku s at the brooks eckerd distribution centers and retrofitting the planograms in the brooks eckerd stores 
we expect the levels of inventory to decrease as these activities are completed 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to conforming vendor terms as part of the integration efforts 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted by income from operations  net proceeds of million for the sale of certain of our third party receivables and a decrease in accounts payable 
these items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted by net proceeds of million from the sale of certain of our third party receivables and receipts of cash related to insured losses 
these items were partially offset by an increase in inventory net of an increase in accounts payable and an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
cash used in investing activities was  million in fiscal cash used was primarily for the acquisition of brooks eckerd and purchase of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets offset by proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  the purchase of prescription file and capitalizable direct acquisition costs related to our pending acquisition of brooks eckerd 
cash was provided by proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions and proceeds from other asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and the purchase of prescription files 
cash was provided by proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions and by proceeds from other asset dispositions 
cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal cash provided by financing was primarily provided by proceeds from issuance of long term debt utilized to fund the brooks eckerd acquisition  net proceeds from our revolving credit facility  the change in the zero balance cash accounts and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  offset by financing costs paid  scheduled debt payments and preferred stock dividends 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal cash provided from issuance of two bonds and the term loan portion of our senior secured credit facility was used to fund the redemption and payment at maturity of several bonds and to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  due to the amending of our credit facility and principal payments on long term debt 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to the new store construction  store relocation  store remodel and store improvement projects  related to the integration of brooks eckerd  related to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacies and related to technology enhancements  improvements to distribution centers  and other corporate requirements 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and use of the revolving credit facility 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt  including additional debt incurred for the acquisition of brooks eckerd 
based upon our current levels of operations  planned improvements in our operating performance and the opportunities that we believe the acquisition of brooks eckerd provides  we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  sales of accounts receivable under our securitization agreements  proceeds from sale leaseback of owned properties and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures including capital expenditures related to the completion of the brooks eckerd integration  for the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance  and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
the restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness in our senior secured credit facility and several of our bond indentures may limit our ability to obtain additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation establishes criteria for recognizing and measuring the financial statement tax effects of positions taken on a company s tax returns 
a two step process is prescribed whereby the threshold for recognition is a more likely than not test that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
if it is determined that a tax position should be recognized  then the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted fin on march  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard establishes a standard definition for fair value  establishes a framework under generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in december  a fasb staff position fsp was proposed  and subsequently approved  to delay the effective dates of sfas no 
as it relates to all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  or at least annually 
we are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect to elect fair value treatment for our financial assets 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised business combinations 
sfas revised establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and make several changes to the method of accounting for business combinations previously set forth in sfas no 
sfas no 
revised will become effective for acquisitions consummated in fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
variability reflected in the sensitivity analyses presented below is reasonably likely based on our recent historical experience 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and sensitivity analyses 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management allowance for uncollectible receivables almost all of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  prescription benefit management companies  government agencies  private employers  health maintenance organizations or other managed care providers 
we recognize and report receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers  who are employees or members of those payors  which have not yet been paid 
we maintain an allowance for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this allowance is calculated based upon historical collection and write off activity adjusted for current conditions 
the estimated bad debt write off rate is calculated by dividing historical write offs for the most recent twelve months  for which collection activities have been completed  by third party payor sales for the same period 
a bad debt expense is recognized by applying the estimated write off rate to third party payor sales for the period 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our estimated write off rate over the past three years 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  an additional reserve would be recorded in the period in which the change in financial condition first became known 
based on current conditions  we do not expect a significant change to our write off rate in future periods 
a one basis point difference in our estimated write off rate for the year ended march   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
inventory the carrying value of our inventory is reduced by a reserve for estimated shrink losses that occur between physical inventory dates 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations including stores and distribution centers  as well as overall loss trends as determined during physical inventory procedures 
the estimated shrink rate is calculated by dividing historical shrink results for the most recent six months by the sales for the same period 
shrink expense is recognized by applying the estimated shrink rate to sales since the last physical inventory 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our shrink rate over the last three years 
although possible  we do not expect a significant change to our shrink rate in future periods 
a basis point difference in our estimated shrink rate for the year ended march   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including stores and excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
we have identified each store as an asset group for purposes of performing this evaluation 
our evaluation of whether possible impairment indicators exist includes comparing future cash flows expected to be generated by the store to the carrying value of the store s assets 
if the estimated future cash flows of the asset group store level are less than the carrying amount of the store s assets  we calculate an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the store s assets to the fair value of such assets 
we determine fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the store discussed above 
cash flows are calculated utilizing the detailed store financial plan for the year immediately following the current year end 
to arrive at cash flow estimates for additional future years  we project sales growth by store consistent with our overall business planning objectives and results  and determine the incremental cash flow that such sales growth will contribute to that store s operations 
the discount rate used is a weighted average cost of capital  which is internally developed 
the assumptions utilized in calculating impairment are updated annually 
should actual sales growth rates and related incremental cash flow differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to the stores being evaluated 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal goodwill impairment as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  million as of march  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
if certain events or circumstances occur that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting unit could exist  we would then perform our impairment test more frequently 
our impairment calculation is based upon a comparison of the book value of our equity compared to our estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value utilizing both a discounted cash flow analysis that is based upon forward year projections that are developed as part of our business planning process  as well as the value implied by our year end quoted stock price 
significant differences between these two methods are reconciled and adjustments  if necessary  are incorporated into our discounted cash flow analysis 
these forward year projections utilize assumptions that are based upon historical trends  management s estimates of economic conditions and our strategic plans  which are consistent with assumptions utilized in evaluating long lived assets for impairment as discussed above 
significant assumptions are annual sales increases and the discount rate utilized 
the discount rate used is a weighted average cost of capital  which is internally developed 
our calculation as of march  resulted in no impairment of goodwill being identified 
however  changes to our strategic plans or economic conditions could result in our cash flows being less than projected  which could result in a material change to our goodwill impairment valuation in future periods 
an increase in our discount rate of basis points would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill as of march  self insurance liabilities we expense claims for self insured medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage as incurred including an estimate for claims incurred but not paid 
the expense for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not paid is determined by multiplying the average claim value paid over the most recent twelve months by the average number of days from the same period between when the claims were incurred and paid 
there have been no significant changes in assumptions used to determine days lag over the last three years 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was previously estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  expense recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
a one day change in days lag for the year ended march   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
the expense for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims incurred but not paid is determined using several factors  including historical claims experience and development  severity of claims  medical costs and the time needed to settle claims 
we discount the estimated expense for workers compensation to present value as the time period from incurrence of the claim to final settlement can be several years 
we base our estimates for such timing on previous settlement activity 
the discount rate is based on the current market rates for treasury bills that approximate the average time to settle the workers compensation claims 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis 
a basis point difference in the discount rate for the year ended march   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that utilize various assumptions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the mortality rate  the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are updated annually and are based on available public information  market interest rates and internal plans regarding compensation and any other changes impacting benefits 
these assumptions have not significantly changed over the last three years  except that the discount rate has been adjusted due to changes in rates derived from published high quality long term bond indices  the terms of which approximate the term of the cash flows to pay the accumulated benefit obligations when due 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate  assuming no other changes in the estimates  increases the amount of the projected benefit obligation and the related required expense by million and million  respectively 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs and anticipated future subleases of properties 
the reserves are calculated at the individual location level and the assumptions are assessed at that level 
sublease income is estimated based on agreements in place at the time of reserve assessment 
the reserve for lease exit liabilities is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
reserve estimates and related assumptions are updated on a quarterly basis 
a substantial amount of our closed stores were closed prior to our adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective january  therefore  if interest rates change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
in addition  changes in the real estate leasing markets can have an impact on the reserve 
as of march   a basis point variance in the credit adjusted risk free interest rate would have affected pretax income by approximately million for fiscal income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence including our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
the weight given to the potential effect of the negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our valuation allowance over the last three years 
changes in valuation allowance from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fin and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with in house counsel  and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
these estimates are updated as the facts and circumstances of the cases develop and or change 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
changes to these reserves during the last three fiscal years were not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
we currently do not have any derivative transactions outstanding 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of march  thereafter total fair value at march dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion fixed rate   average interest rate variable rate      average interest rate our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are based on libor 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of as of march  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately  million on march  a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 
in addition to the financial instruments listed above  the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our receivables securitization agreements are determined based on libor
