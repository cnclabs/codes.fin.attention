overview we are a global supplier of high quality  application specific standard products within the broad discrete and analog semiconductor markets 
these products include diodes  rectifiers  transistors  mosfets  protection devices  functional specific arrays  power management devices including dc dc switching and linear voltage regulators  amplifiers and comparators  hall effect sensors  and silicon wafers used to manufacture these products 
we design  manufacture and market these semiconductors focused on diverse end user applications in the consumer electronics  computing  industrial  communications and automotive sectors 
semiconductors  which provide electronic signal amplification and switching functions  are basic building block electronic components that are incorporated into almost every electronic device 
we believe that our focus on standard semiconductor products provides us with a meaningful competitive advantage relative to other semiconductor companies that provide a wider range of semiconductor products 
we are headquartered in dallas  texas 
we have two manufacturing facilities located in shanghai  china  an analog design center located in hsinchu  taiwan and a wafer fabrication facility in kansas city  missouri 
our sales and marketing and logistical centers are located in westlake village  california  taipei  taiwan  shanghai and shenzhen  china  and hong kong 
we also have regional sales offices or representatives in derbyshire  england  toulouse  france  frankfurt  germany  and various cities in the united states 
in  we began to transform our business from the distribution of discrete semiconductors manufactured by others to the design  manufacture and marketing of discrete semiconductor products using our internal manufacturing capabilities 
the key elements of our strategy of transforming our business from a distribution based model to one primarily based on the design and manufacture of proprietary products are expanding our manufacturing capacity  including establishing integrated state of the art packaging and testing facilities in asia  in and  and acquiring a wafer foundry in the us in  expanding our sales and marketing organization in asia in order to address the shift of manufacturing of electronics products from the united states to asia  establishing our sales and marketing organization in europe commencing in  and expanding the number of our field application engineers to design our products into specific end user applications  in implementing this strategy  the following factors have affected  and  we believe  will continue to affect  our results of operations since  we have experienced increases in the demand for our products  and substantial pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the selling price of our products 
we expect future increases in net income to result primarily from increases in sales volume and improvements in product mix in order to offset reduced average selling prices of our products 
in and  and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from products introduced within the last three years  which we term new products  compared to in new products generally have gross profit margins that are significantly higher than the margins of our standard products 
we expect net sales derived from new products to increase in absolute terms  although our net sales of new products as a percentage of our net sales will depend on the demand for our standard products  as well as our product mix 
our gross profit margin was in  compared to in and in our gross profit margin decrease in was due to the lower gross margin related to the acquisition of the analog product line 
we recently completed the move of our analog product from taiwan to our china manufacturing facilities to increase the gross margin on this product line 
future gross profit margins will depend primarily on our product mix  cost savings  and the demand for our products 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in our asian manufacturing facilities 
during  we invested approximately million in our asian manufacturing facilities and we expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing facilities  although the amount to be invested will depend on product demand and new product developments 
during  the percentage of our net sales derived from our asian subsidiaries was  compared to in and in we expect our net sales to the asian market to continue to increase as a percentage of our total net sales for and beyond as a result of the continuing shift of the manufacture of electronic products from the us to asia 
we have increased our investment in research and development from million in to million in we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on proprietary semiconductor processes and packaging technologies 
our goal is to expand research and development expenses to approximately to of net sales  which will enable us to bring additional proprietary devices to the market 
on october   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due notes  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the notes will be convertible into cash or  at our option  cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares split adjusted per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of per share  split adjusted  in certain circumstances 
in addition  following a make whole fundamental change that occurs prior to october   we will  at our option  increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change  in certain circumstances 
we intend to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or purchases of our own common stock 
during  we sold million shares split adjusted of our common stock in a follow on public offering  raising approximately million net of commissions and expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds in connection with the anachip and apd acquisitions  and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including additional acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  in december  we announced the acquisition of anachip  a fabless taiwanese semiconductor company focused on analog ics designed for specific applications 
the million acquisition  which was completed in january  is in line with our long term strategy 
anachip s main product focus is power management ics 
the analog devices they produce are used in lcd monitor tvs  wireless lan access points  brushless dc motor fans  portable dvd players  datacom devices  adsl modems  tv satellite set top boxes  and power supplies 
anachip brings a design team with strong capabilities in a range of targeted analog and power management technologies 
on november   we completed the purchase of the assets of apd semiconductor  a privately held us based fabless semiconductor company 
apd s main product focus is its patented and trademarked super barrier rectifier tm sbr technology 
the purchase price of the acquisition was million in addition to a potential earn out provision with respect to pre defined covered products 
the apd acquisition will further strengthen our technology leadership in the standard semiconductor market and expand our product capabilities across important segments of our end markets 
net sales we generate a substantial portion of our net sales through the sale of semiconductor products that are designed and manufactured by third parties or us 
we also generate a portion of our net sales from outsourcing our manufacturing capacity to third parties and from the sale of silicon wafers to manufacturers of discrete and analog semiconductor components 
we serve customers across diversified industries  including the consumer electronics  computing  industrial  communications and automotive markets 
we recognize revenue from product sales when title to and risk of loss of the product have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met upon shipment to our customers 
net sales are stated net of reserves for pricing adjustments  discounts  rebates and returns 
the principal factors that have affected or could affect our net sales from period to period are the condition of the economy in general and of the semiconductor industry in particular  our customers adjustments in their order levels  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  the termination of key supplier relationships  the rate of introduction to  and acceptance of new products by  our customers  our ability to compete effectively with our current and future competitors  our ability to enter into and renew key corporate and strategic relationships with our customers  vendors and strategic alliances  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  a major disruption of our information technology infrastructure  and unforeseen catastrophic events  such as armed conflict  terrorism  fires  typhoons and earthquakes 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs for our semiconductors and our wafers 
these costs include raw materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the labor costs and overhead expenses 
in addition to costs of raw materials  cost of goods sold is also impacted by yield improvements  capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  cost of goods sold includes the cost of products that we purchase from other manufacturers and sell to our customers 
cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not efficient 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and associated expenses for personnel in general management  sales and marketing  information technology  engineering  human resources  procurement  planning and finance  and sales commissions  as well as outside legal  accounting and consulting expenses  and other operating expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales  marketing and engineering efforts and information technology infrastructure 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development projects  as well as materials and equipment used for these projects 
research and development expenses are primarily associated with our wafer facility in kansas city  missouri and our facilities in china and taiwan  as well as with our engineers in the us all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred  and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in new technologies and product lines 
interest income expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investment balances 
interest expense consists of interest payable on our outstanding credit facilities and other debt instruments including the convertible bonds 
income tax provision income tax expenses of million  million and million were recorded for the years ended december    and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our lower effective tax rate in compared with the prior year was the result of lower income in the us and higher income in lower taxed jurisdictions  as well as a decrease in the amount of estimated repatriation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  partially offset by the increased income tax rate at one of our china subsidiaries diodes shanghai is subject to a preferential tax rate from through  compared to a tax rate in 
our global presence requires us to pay income taxes in a number of jurisdictions 
in general  earnings in the us and taiwan are currently subject to tax rates of and  respectively 
in addition  taiwan earnings are subject to an additional retained earnings tax should the taiwan earnings not be distributed 
earnings of diodes hong kong are subject to a tax for local sales or local source sales  all other hong kong sales are not subject to foreign income taxes 
earnings at diodes taiwan and diodes hong kong are also subject to us taxes with respect to those earnings that are derived from product manufactured by our china subsidiaries and sold to customers outside of taiwan and hong kong  respectively 
the us tax rate on this subpart f income is computed as the difference between the foreign effective tax rates and the us tax rate 
in accordance with us tax law  we receive credit against our us federal tax liability for income taxes paid by our foreign subsidiaries 
as an incentive for the formation of anachip  earnings of anachip are subject to a five year tax holiday subject to certain qualifications of taiwanese tax law 
in the third quarter of  we elected to begin this five year tax holiday as of january  beginning  anachip earnings will be subject to statutory taiwan income tax 
diodes china is located in the songjiang district  where the standard central government tax rate was through however  as an incentive for establishing diodes china  the earnings of diodes china were subject to a tax rate by the central government from through  and to a tax rate from through in addition  due to a million permanent re investment of diodes china earnings in  diodes china has received additional preferential tax treatment earnings will be exempted from central government income tax for two years  and then subject to tax rates in the range of to for the following three years on earnings that are generated by this million investment 
in addition  the earnings of diodes china would ordinarily be subject to a standard local government tax rate of 
however  as an incentive for establishing diodes china  the local government waived this tax from through management expects this tax to be waived for as well  however  the local government can re impose this tax at its discretion at any time 
in  we established our second shanghai based manufacturing facility  diodes shanghai  located in the songjiang export zone of shanghai  china 
in the songjiang export zone  the central government standard tax rate is  and there is no local government tax 
as an incentive for establishing diodes shanghai  the and earnings of diodes shanghai were exempted from central government income tax  and for the years through its earnings will be subject to tax rates in the range of to 
the recent china government income tax reform terminates some existing tax incentives for foreign enterprises doing business in china 
the central government tax rate in china will increase to beginning in  however we believe diodes china may qualify for a high technology preferential tax treatment that could reduce the tax rate to 
it is unclear to what extent our china subsidiaries will continue to receive preferential tax treatment 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before with respect to state and local jurisdictions and countries outside of the us  with limited exceptions  we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that adequate amounts of tax  interest and penalties  if any  have been provided for in our fin reserve for any adjustments that may result from future tax audits 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin effective january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  primarily related to our foreign subsidiaries  by approximately million during the first quarter of  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
accordingly  as of january  and december   approximately million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next months 
these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or competent authority proceedings 
at this time  an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when our product is shipped to our customers 
we reduce revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances  the majority of which are related to our us operations 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to revenues 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory  both finished goods and raw material  for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value  we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of  or generation of  taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the available evidence  the company does not believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  the company established a valuation allowance of approximately million in to offset foreign tax credits that are considered more likely than not to expire before the company is able to utilize the tax benefit 
the company considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
to the extent that the company is unable to generate adequate taxable income  the company may be required to increase the valuation allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts management evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets as of december   goodwill was million 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  for which goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually our impairment review process is based upon i an income approach from a discounted cash flow analysis  which uses our estimates of revenues  costs and expenses  as well as market growth rates  and ii a market multiples approach which measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent sales or offerings or comparable public entities 
if ever the carrying value of the goodwill is determined to be less than the fair value of the reporting unit net assets  a write down of the goodwill will be required  with the resulting expense charged in the period that the impairment is determined 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets on an on going basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value using a discounted cash flow analysis 
share based compensation prior to january   we accounted for the share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board statement sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock option awards was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as all options granted under our stock option plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payments  using the modified prospective method 
no modifications were made to any outstanding share options prior to the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r requires us to value stock options prior to our adoption of sfas under the fair value method and expense these amounts over the stock options remaining vesting period 
this resulted in an expense of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  which was recorded within cost of goods sold  general and administrative expense  and research and development expense in our condensed consolidated income statement 
in addition  sfas r requires us to reflect any tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in our financial statements as a financing cash inflow in its statement of cash flows rather than as an operating cash flow as in prior periods 
we have changed our primary award type from stock options to stock awards as an improved method of reward and retention 
in general  for new grants  we also extended the vesting period from three years to four years  and reduced the number of shares subject to the award 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the estimated term of the option and the estimated future volatility of the option 
the estimated term and estimated future volatility of the options require our judgment 
we have provided pro forma disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our net income and net income per share for the year ended december  as if we used the fair value method under fas we have approximately million restricted stock grants outstanding as of december  compensation expense is recognized for restricted stock grants over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the award 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested restricted stock awards 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition to the expense  the effects of the restricted stock grants are included in the diluted shares outstanding calculation see note share based compensation

our primary liquidity requirements have been to meet our inventory and capital expenditure needs 
for  and  our working capital was million  million  and million  respectively 
we anticipate our working capital position will be sufficient for at least the next months 
during  we sold million split adjusted shares of our common stock in a follow on public offering  raising approximately million net of commissions and expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds in connection with the anachip acquisition  and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including additional acquisitions 
on october 
 we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due notes  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  we intend to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or purchases of our own common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we incurred approximately million of issuance costs  which primarily consisted of investment banker fees  legal and accounting fees 
these costs are classified within other assets and are being amortized as a component of interest expense using the straight line method over the life of the notes from issuance through october  on july   we declared a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable on july  to stockholders of record on july  under the terms of this stock dividend  our stockholders received one additional share for every two shares held on the record date 
the dividend was paid in authorized but unissued shares of common stock 
fractional shares created by the stock dividend were paid in cash based upon the closing price of our common stock on the record date 
the par value of our stock is not affected by the dividend and remains at per share

in  and  our capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures for these periods were primarily related to manufacturing expansion in our facilities in china and  to a lesser extent  our wafer fabrication facility in the us  and an office building in taiwan 
the capital expenditures for were approximately of revenue 
as of december   we had million invested primarily in auction rate securities  which are classified as current  available for sale investments 
although the maturities of the securities are over years  management expects to convert these securities into cash within one year and does not anticipate holding the investments until maturity  therefore  the securities are classified as short term and included in short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying values of available for sale securities approximates fair value 
these investments are primarily in municipal and student loan association bonds that are fully collateralized by aaa rated bonds and or insured against loss of principal and interest by aaa rated bond insurers 
none of these investments are collateralized mortgage obligations or are any other type of mortgage or real estate backed security 
auction rate securities are generally long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined calendar intervals 
these mechanisms generally allow existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
we generally invest in these securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
however  the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions occurring subsequent to december   because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders  resulting in our continuing to hold these securities and the issuers paying interest at the maximum contractual rates which are higher than similar securities for which auctions have cleared 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auctions related to more of these securities will be unsuccessful in the near term 
unsuccessful auctions could result in our holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates if a secondary market does not develop  thereby limiting the short term liquidity of these investments

recently issued accounting pronouncements and proposed accounting changes in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which changes how business acquisitions are accounted 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
among the more significant changes in the accounting for acquisitions are the following i transaction costs will generally be expensed 
certain such costs are presently treated as costs of the acquisition  ii in process research and development ipr d will be accounted for as an asset  with the cost recognized as the research and development is realized or abandoned 
ipr d is presently expensed at the time of the acquisition  iii contingencies  including contingent consideration  will generally be recorded at fair value with subsequent adjustments recognized in operations 
contingent consideration is presently accounted for as an adjustment of purchase price  and iv decreases in valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets will be recognized in operations 
such changes previously were considered to be subsequent changes in consideration and were recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations and adjustments to an acquired entity s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after december  the company is currently evaluating the future impacts and disclosures of this standard 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 which establishes new standards governing the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests ncis in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries 
certain provisions of this standard indicate  among other things  that ncis previously referred to as minority interests be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability  that increases and decrease in the parent s ownership interest  that leave control intact  be treated as equity transactions  rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses  and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the nci even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance 
this standard also requires changes to certain presentation and disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
is effective beginning january  the provisions of the standard are to be applied to all ncis prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which are to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
after adoption  noncontrolling interests million and million at december  and  respectively will be classified as shareowners equity  a change from its current classification between liabilities and shareowners equity 
the company is currently evaluating the future impacts and disclosures of this standard 
in december  the fasb ratified the eitf consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements that discusses how parties to a collaborative arrangement which does not establish a legal entity within such arrangement should account for various activities 
the consensus indicates that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties ie parties outside of the collaborative arrangement should be reported by the collaborators on the respective line items in their income statements pursuant to eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
additionally  the consensus provides that income statement characterization of payments between the participants in a collaborative arrangement should be based upon existing authoritative pronouncements  analogy to such pronouncements if not within their scope  or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf issue no 
is effective for the company beginning january  and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for collaborative arrangements existing as of the date of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating the impacts and disclosures of this standard

in february  fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in earnings 
fas is effective as of january  at the effective date  an entity may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date 
the entity shall report the effect of the first re measurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the company has not elected the fair value option for eligible items that existed as of january  in september  fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements fas 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we have not yet determined the effect  if any  that the implementation of fas will have on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia 
our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan and the taiwanese dollar and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
because of the relatively small size and nature of each individual currency exposure  we do not regularly employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
if the chinese yuan and the taiwanese dollar were to strengthen or weaken by against the us dollar  we would experience currency loss of approximately million and currency gain of approximately million  respectively 
in the future  we may enter into hedging arrangements designed to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations 
the chinese government has begun to permit the chinese yuan to float more freely compared to other world currencies 
should the chinese government allow a significant chinese yuan appreciation  and we do not take appropriate means to offset this exposure  the effect could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
interest rate risk 
we have credit facilities with us and asian financial institutions as well as other debt instruments with interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense 
as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   our outstanding debt under our interest bearing credit agreements was million  including million convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately million 
political risk 
we have a significant portion of our assets in mainland china and taiwan 
the possibility of political conflict between the two countries or with the us could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business through these important business segments and to generate profits 
see risk factors foreign operations 
liquidity risk 
as of december   we had million invested primarily in auction rate securities  which are classified as current  available for sale investments 
although the maturities of the securities are over years  management expects to convert these securities into cash within one year and does not anticipate holding the investments until maturity  therefore within one year and does not anticipate holding the investments until maturity  therefore  the securities are classified as short term and included in short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying values of available for sale securities approximates fair value 
these investments are primarily in municipal and student loan association bonds that are fully collateralized by aaa rated bonds and or insured against loss of principal and interest by aaa rated bond insurers 
none of these investments are collateralized mortgage obligations or are any other type of mortgage or real estate backed security 
auction rate securities are generally long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined calendar intervals

unsuccessful auctions could result in our holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates if a secondary market does not develop  thereby limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
inflation risk 
inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal years through a significant increase in inflation could affect future performance
