risk factors we are dependent on the performance of the affiliated practices for our net revenue our net revenue depends primarily on revenue generated by the affiliated practices 
we do not employ dentists  except for arizona s tooth doctor for kids  and we do not control the clinical decisions of any of the affiliated practices 
there can be no assurance that the affiliated practices will maintain successful operations or that any of the key members of a particular affiliated practice will continue practicing with that practice 
availability of dentists  hygienists or assistants could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent permitted by state law  each affiliated practice has entered into non competition agreements and other restrictive covenants with dentists under their employ and we have similar restrictive covenants with tooth doctor s dentists 
there can be no assurance that these restrictive covenants will remain in effect in all cases  are or will be sufficient to protect the interests of the affiliated practices or that a court will enforce such agreements 
any material loss of revenue by an affiliated practice  whether due to the loss of existing dentists or the inability to recruit new ones  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the service agreements we have entered into with each of the affiliated practices  except for tooth doctor  for substantially all of our revenue 
revenue generated from our service agreements with pdg  pa  the affiliated dental practice at park dental  and with wisconsin dental group  sc  the affiliated practice at forward dental  represented and  respectively of our consolidated net revenue in effective december   the service agreement with pdg  pa was terminated  and on february   we transferred the assets of of the dental facilities and related assets to it see item legal proceedings 
we retained the remaining six dental facilities  and the revenue generated from these remaining dental facilities will be a significantly smaller percentage of our consolidated net revenue in on september   we acquired metropolitan dental holdings  inc metro 
in connection with the acquisition  a subsidiary of metro entered into a year service agreement with metro dentalcare  a professional limited liability company 
we expect net revenue from this affiliation will be more than of our consolidated net revenue in the termination of either this service agreement or the service agreement with wisconsin dental group  sc would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any material loss in patient revenue by one or more practices affiliated with us by means of a service agreement would have a material adverse effect on their ability to reimburse us for expenses and to pay our service fees 
the failure to receive such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event of a breach of a service agreement by an affiliated practice  there can be no assurance that the remedies available to us under our service agreements would be enforceable or adequate to compensate us for damages as a result of the breach 
our net revenue may be adversely affected by third party payor cost containment efforts a significant portion of the payments for dental care that is received by the affiliated practices is paid or reimbursed under insurance programs with third party payors 
third party payors are continually negotiating the fees charged for dental care  with a goal of containing reimbursement and utilization rates 
loss of revenue by the affiliated practices caused by third party payor cost containment efforts or an inability to negotiate satisfactory reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some third party payor contracts are capitated arrangements 
under such contracts  the affiliated practice receives a monthly payment based on the number of members for which they provide care and generally receives a co payment from the patient at the time care is provided 
such payment methods shift a portion of the risk of providing care from the third party payors to the affiliated practice 
to the extent that patients covered by such contracts require more frequent or extensive care than is anticipated  there may be a shortfall between the capitated payments received by the affiliated practice and the costs incurred to provide such care 
unfavorable utilization under these contracts  as well as termination of such contracts  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents tooth doctor is largely dependent upon reimbursements under arizona s medicaid program 
changes in that program affecting provider eligibility  reimbursement rates or specific dental procedures eligible for reimbursement  or tooth doctor s failure to retain its authorization as a provider under that program  or to comply with applicable state and federal law or its contracts with the payors who administer claims and make payments under that program  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment the dental industry and dental practices are highly regulated at the state and federal levels  as described in item business government regulation 
many of these laws and regulations vary widely by state 
in addition  these laws and regulations are enforced by federal and state regulatory authorities with broad discretion  and our agreements may be subject to review by these authorities from time to time 
for example  regulatory authorities in some states in which we operate have obtained a copy of our service agreement for review in the past  and in the future such reviews could result in changes to our service agreements 
we do not  and do not intend to  control the practice of dentistry by the affiliated practices or their compliance with the regulatory requirements directly applicable to dentists or the practice of dentistry 
however  there can be no assurance that any review of our business relationships  including our relationship with the affiliated practices  by courts or other regulatory authorities  will not result in determinations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the laws and regulatory environment will not change to restrict or limit the enforceability of our service agreements 
the laws and regulations of some states in which we currently operate or may seek to expand may require us to change our contractual relationships with dental group practices in a manner that may restrict our operations in those states or may prevent us from affiliating with dental group practices or providing comprehensive business services to dental group practices in those states  or may require us to restructure our current or future operations 
for example  a bill recently introduced in the arizona legislature would impose additional specific reporting and other obligations on business entities  such as us  who own dental practices  and there have been efforts in the past to enact legislation which would have restricted our ability to own dental practices in that state 
there can be no assurance that similar legislation will not be enacted in the future 
additionally  the arizona board of dentistry is considering revising its rules regarding the use of sedation 
new rules have been proposed by a committee of the board  but those rules have not been adopted 
those or other changes to the sedation rules could adversely affect tooth doctor 
to the extent that contracts between third party payors and any affiliated practice or us  including self insured plans  on a capitated or other basis which causes such affiliated practices or us to assume a portion of the financial risk of providing dental care  we or such affiliated practice may become subject to state insurance laws  in which case the affiliated practice may be required to change the method of payment from third party payors or seek appropriate licensure 
if we or any affiliated practice is determined to be engaged in the business of insurance  we may be required to change our contractual relationships or seek appropriate licensure 
any regulation of us or the affiliated practices under insurance laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future affiliations may not be successfully integrated or completed on acceptable terms our strategy includes expansion through affiliations with dental group practices in new and existing communities and the expansion of such affiliated practices 
affiliations involve numerous risks  including failure to retain key personnel and contracts of the affiliated practices and the inability to work successfully with us as a business partner 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete additional affiliations on acceptable terms and conditions or that we will be able to serve successfully as a business partner to additional practices  and this could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we entered into agreements to amend our revolving credit agreement and our term loan effective february  which limit amounts which can be borrowed to fund affiliations and acquisitions  and as a result the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months will be at levels lower than we achieved in recent years 

table of contents we may not be able to refinance our credit facilities on satisfactory terms our revolving credit facility and term loan mature on june  our failure to refinance our revolving credit facility and term loan with our existing lenders or others on satisfactory terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the expected value of our intangible assets a significant portion of our total assets is represented by intangible assets  with the amount expected to increase with future affiliations 
in addition  the related amortization expense will increase in the future as a result of additional intangible assets recorded in connection with new affiliations 
in the event of any sale or liquidation of us or a portion of our assets  there can be no assurance that the value of our intangible assets will be realized 
management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the definite lived intangible asset may be impaired  such as loss of key personnel  change in legal factors or competition 
if impairment were determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may be adversely affected by professional liability claims against the affiliated practices the affiliated practices and or individual dentists in their employ could be exposed to the risk of professional liability claims  and it is possible that such claims could also be asserted against us 
with respect to tooth doctor  any such claims would likely be asserted against us 
such claims  if successful  could result in substantial damages that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
we are named as an insured under the professional liability insurance policy covering the affiliated practices 
in addition  we also require each affiliated practice to indemnify us for actions or omissions related to the delivery of dental care by such affiliated practice 
however  a successful professional liability claim against an affiliated practice or us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business our continued success depends upon the retention of our senior officers who have been instrumental in our success and upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals 
the loss of some of our senior officers  or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals  could materially adversely affect us 
continued growth and success in our business depends  to a large degree  on our ability to retain and attract such employees

in one of these transactions  we developed de novo dental facilities rather than acquiring non clinical assets  and we entered into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
in of these transactions  we acquired non clinical assets  and the practices were combined with one of our existing affiliated practices and became subject to an existing service agreement 
in one of these transactions  we acquired the assets of the practice  arizona s tooth doctor for kids tooth doctor  and as permitted by applicable state law  tooth doctor employs the dentists thus not necessitating a service agreement between us and the affiliated practice

revenue overview net revenue our net revenue includes management fees earned by us pursuant to the terms of the service agreements with the affiliated practices  as well as reimbursement of clinic expenses paid by us on their behalf  and other revenue which includes patient revenue of tooth doctor  fees earned by our dental benefits third party administrator tpa  fees earned by our dental laboratory and other miscellaneous revenue 

table of contents the following table provides the components of our net revenue for  and in thousands reimbursement of expenses business service fees revenue earned under service agreements other revenue net revenue reflects approximately in revenue earned under service agreements where business service fees are based upon a percentage of patient revenue or collections on patient revenue 
fees earned under service agreements include reimbursement of expenses incurred by us on behalf of the affiliated practices in connection with the operation and administration of dental facilities and business service fees charged to the affiliated practices pursuant to the terms of the service agreements for management services provided and capital committed by us 
under certain service agreements  representing of our business service fees  our business service fee consists of a monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under a certain service agreement  representing of our business service fees  our business service fee consists of i a monthly fee for the first six months of the year equal to the prior year service fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the increase of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the prior year and ii a monthly fee for the second six months of the year which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under certain service agreements  representing of our business service fees  our business service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement of us and the affiliated practice in a formal planning process 
under certain other service agreements  representing less than of our business service fees  our business service fee consists of either a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the planned amount for the current year  a specified percentage of patient revenue or a specified percentage of collections on patient revenue

for additional information on components of our net revenue  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
patient revenue of the affiliated practices we believe it is important to understand patient revenue of the affiliated practices 
this includes the practices that we do not control  nor own any equity interests in  and are affiliated with us by means of service agreements 
we do not consolidate the financial statements of these affiliated practices with ours  and accordingly their patient revenue is not a measure of our financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles because it is not our revenue 
it is however  a financial measure we use  along with the patient revenue of tooth doctor  to monitor operating performance and to help identify and analyze trends of the affiliated practices which may impact our business 
most of the operating expenses incurred by us  pursuant to service agreements  are on behalf of the affiliated practices in the operation of dental facilities 
these expenses are significantly affected by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices 

table of contents the affiliated practices generate revenue from providing care to patients and receive payment from patients and dental benefit providers  or payors  under fee for service  ppo plans and managed care capitation plans 
patient revenue reflects the amounts billed by an affiliated practice at its established rates reduced by any contractual adjustments and allowances for uncollectible accounts

net revenue from our service agreement with wisconsin dental group  sc  the affiliated practice at forward dental  represented approximately of our consolidated net revenue for and of our consolidated net revenue for and no other service agreement or customers accounted for greater than of our consolidated net revenue 
in december  we entered into a litigation settlement agreement in which the service agreement with pdg was terminated see litigation settlement 
as a result  the net revenue generated from the dental facilities we did not transfer to pdg as part of the litigation settlement will be a significantly smaller percentage of our consolidated net revenue in on september   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of metro 
in connection with the acquisition  a subsidiary of metro entered into a year service agreement with an affiliated professional limited liability company  metro dentalcare  plc 
we expect net revenue from this transaction to be more than of our consolidated net revenue beginning in the termination of either this service agreement or the service agreement with wisconsin dental group  sc could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as part of the litigation settlement with pdg  we entered into a transition services agreement effective january  see litigation settlement 
under the agreement  we will continue to provide certain of the same types of services to pdg as we provide under our other service agreements 
we will recognize  of net revenue related to this agreement from january to september salaries and benefits salaries and benefits expense includes costs for personnel working at the dental facilities  dental laboratory and local and regional shared service centers 
at the facility level  we generally employ the administrative staff and  where permitted by state law  the hygienists and dental assistants 
we also employ the dentists at tooth doctor 
the personnel at the local and regional shared service centers support the dental facilities 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of tooth doctor where we employ the dentists 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to staff productivity increases at the affiliated dental groups and to a lesser extent in market affiliations completed in where we do not employ the hygienists and dental assistants  thereby lowering our salaries and benefits expense in relation to net revenue earned 
lab fees and dental supplies lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
lab fees and dental supplies expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased to in from in these expenses are largely impacted by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices and as a percentage of patient revenue were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these decreases are due to a decrease in lab fees as a percentage of patient revenue as a result of the and acquisitions and affiliations where patient care involves fewer procedures requiring crowns  bridges and other dental laboratory services 
for to  lab fees as a percent or our net revenue remained unchanged at  as well as a percentage of patient revenue at  primarily because of our increased 
table of contents utilization of our dental laboratory by the affiliated practices and to a lesser extent our continued focus on managing dental supplies expenses 
office occupancy office occupancy expense includes rent expense and certain other operating costs  such as utilities  associated with dental facilities  dental laboratory and the local and regional shared service centers 
such costs vary based on the size of each facility and the market rental rate for dental office and administrative space in each particular geographic market 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased to in from in this decrease is primarily due to our acquisition of tooth doctor where office occupancy expenses are lower as a percentage of net revenue compared to other affiliated dental groups  a  lease buy out payment made during the year ended december  and  to a lesser extent  improved facility utilization at the affiliated dental groups 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in this increase is primarily due to the relocations of our national information systems group and minnesota resource group at the beginning of  a  lease buy out payment and  to a lesser extent  the full year impact of a relocation of a dental facility in in  we completed five de novo facilities and relocated and or expanded facilities 
in  we completed three de novo facilities and expanded nine facilities 
in  we completed one de novo facility and relocated and or expanded seventeen facilities 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include non employment related insurance expense  professional fees  marketing costs and other general and administrative expenses 
other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in this decrease is due to a reduction in other general and administrative expenses  a decrease in professional fees at the affiliated dental groups  and  to a lesser extent  a non recurring expense in related to the disposal of leasehold improvements 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in this decrease is due to a decrease in professional fees at the affiliated dental groups  a reduction in other general and administrative expenses and  to a lesser extent  leveraging of these expenses at the affiliated dental groups offset by an increase in computer consulting fees 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses consist of compensation and travel expenses for our corporate personnel and administrative staff  facility and other administrative costs of our corporate office and professional fees  including legal and accounting 
general corporate expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in this increase is due to an increase in stock based compensation expense 
general corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in this increase is due to stock based compensation expense which we began recognizing on january  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas no 
r  effective january   resulted in  and  of stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate these costs to remain relatively unchanged in due to fewer anticipated option grants in compared to prior years 
depreciation depreciation expense  including amortization of leasehold improvements  decreased to of net revenue in from in this decrease is primarily due to improved facility utilization at the affiliated practices as well as our acquisition of tooth doctor where depreciation expense is lower as a percentage of patient revenue compared to other affiliated dental groups 
depreciation expense  including amortization of leasehold improvements  as a percentage of net revenue remained unchanged at in and 
table of contents we expect to continue to invest in the development of new dental facilities and the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities in accordingly  depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation may increase in at a rate greater than our net revenue 
in addition  we anticipate depreciation expense of approximately  as a result of the metro affiliation  offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately  as a result of the transfer of facilities in as settlement of the litigation with pdg  pa see litigation settlement 
amortization of service agreements and other intangible assets amortization expense as a percentage of net revenue remained constant at in  and during  the increase in amortization expense from new affiliations was offset by same market net revenue growth of the affiliated dental groups and our acquisition of tooth doctor where the majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
based on an evaluation of historical financial trends in  we determined that the intangible assets associated with certain in market affiliations which were combined with existing affiliated practices were expected to generate future cash flows for a longer period than previously estimated 
accordingly  we increased the amortization period relating to these intangible assets 
as a result  the amortization periods for certain previously completed in market affiliations were increased to years 
this change in estimate impacted  at that time  of our intangible assets and had the effect of reducing amortization expense by approximately  in and  and  in this change in estimate reduced amortization expense  net of tax  by approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets may increase in the future as a result of additional intangible assets recorded in connection with future affiliations and  if applicable and earned  contingent payments on already completed affiliations 
litigation expense on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the pdg litigation among pdhc  one of our minnesota subsidiaries  and pdg 
under the terms of the definitive agreements contemplated by the settlement agreement and in release of the pdg litigation  we transferred to pdg the leases and operating assets of of the park dental facilities and tradename to pdg  effective february  see litigation settlement 
earnings from operations earnings from operations decreased to  in from  in the primary reason for the decrease was the litigation expense of  excluding litigation expense  earnings from operations would have increased to  or of net revenue in from  or of net revenue  in the increase as a percentage of net revenue is primarily due to improved facility utilization  leveraging of other operating expenses and revenue earned from new acquisitions and affiliations completed in and earnings from operations increased to  in from  in excluding litigation expense  earnings from operations increased to  or of net revenue  from  or of net revenue  in the increase was due to a reduction in salaries and benefits as a percentage of net revenue attributable to staff productivity increases at the affiliated dental groups and to a lesser extent in market affiliations completed in where we do not employ the hygienists and dental assistants  thereby lowering our salaries and benefits expense in relation to net revenue earned 
interest expense net interest expense increased to  in from  in pursuant to eitf  we expensed  of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the forbearance agreement we entered into with our lenders on december  excluding this amount  net interest expense was  in the increase in interest expense was due to higher average borrowings 
while market rates affecting our variable rate interest declined in  our effective interest rate was comparable to because of an increase 
table of contents in our borrowing margin as a result of our higher leverage ratios after financing the acquisition of metro 
net interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase in was due to higher interest rates offset by reduced average borrowings outstanding in compared to minority interest in and  we entered into three platform affiliations in which our subsidiaries have minority owners 
on december   we completed the acquisition of the assets of tooth doctor 
the assets of tooth doctor were contributed to a newly created subsidiary which is owned by the company 
in addition  in two of our platform affiliations  we acquired a ownership interest 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded minority interest expense of  and  respectively  representing the gains attributable to minority interest holders net of cumulative losses 
the increase in is primarily due to a full year s inclusion of the tooth doctor minority interest 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for and in and the decrease in is attributable to the expenses associated with the litigation expense see litigation settlement 
excluding these expenses  our effective tax rate would have been 
we expect our effective tax rate to be slightly higher in due to increases in state income taxes

the increase as a percentage of net revenue is due to a reduction in salaries and benefits as a percentage of net revenue attributable to staff productivity increases at the affiliated dental groups and to a lesser extent in market affiliations completed in where we do not employ the hygienists and dental assistants  thereby lowering our salaries and benefits expense in relation to net revenue earned 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  principally from operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving line of credit and term loan 
we have  in the past  also used proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of subordinated promissory notes to finance certain capital needs  but have not done so in recent years 
for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items  an increase in accrued expenses and an increase in accrued compensation and benefits  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  net 
the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to an increase in accruals for professional fees associated with the pdg litigation and  to a lesser extent  an increase in accrued professional liability at our captive insurance subsidiary 
the increase in accrued compensation and benefits is primarily due to increases in accrued bonuses and other benefits 
the increase in accounts receivable  net is due to an increase in amounts due from the affiliated practices  which is largely affected by patient receivables at the affiliated practices which increased to days revenue outstanding as of december  from days revenue outstanding as of december  this increase is primarily due to the implementation of improvis at several of the affiliated dental groups which has historically resulted in a temporary increase in accounts receivable 
for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items  an increase in accounts payable and a 
table of contents decrease in accounts receivable  net  primarily receivables due from affiliated practices 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of payables and an increase in outstanding checks in excess of deposits in transit as of december  as compared to december  the decrease in receivables due from affiliated practices was primarily due to a continued focus on receivables management at the affiliated practices 
the days sales outstanding for the patient receivables of the affiliated practices decreased from days at december  to days at december  for the years ended december  and  cash used for investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the net increase of  in cash used for investing activities is primarily due to an increase of  in cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  net of cash acquired  and an increase in capital expenditures of  and to a lesser extent increases in contingent payments made as part of affiliations and payments of affiliation costs 
cash paid for acquisitions and affiliations increased as a result of the current year s affiliations being larger than those completed in  most notably the acquisition of metro and the affiliation with barzman  kazimov vieth 
in addition  a contingent payment of approximately  which had been accrued as of december   was paid in capital expenditures increased due to project timing as certain relocation and or expansion projects were extended into in addition  a contingent payment of approximately  in relation to the metro acquisition was accrued for as of december  and is expected to be paid in the first quarter of  although we are continuing to evaluate the calculation of the contingent payment and the amount payable may change in for the years ended december  and  cash used for investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the net increase of approximately  in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to an increase of  in cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  net of cash acquired  offset by decreases of  in contingent payments made as part of affiliations and  in capital expenditures 
the remaining increase was due to other investing activities 
the increase in cash paid for affiliations was due to  of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of tooth doctor 
the decrease in contingent payments was due to a  contingent payment made in as a result of a affiliation 
in addition  approximately  in contingent payments as a result of affiliations were accrued for as of december  and paid in capital expenditures decreased due to project timing as approximately  of relocation and or expansion projects were extended into for the years ended december  and  cash provided by financing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the increase of  in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to our term loan borrowing of  and increased net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of approximately  and to a lesser extent an increase of approximately  in tax benefits and proceeds from stock option exercises 
the increased borrowings were used to fund our acquisition and affiliation activities and our captive insurance subsidiary 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased in due to an increased number of option exercises compared to for the years ended december  and  cash provided by financing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the decrease of  in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a reduction in borrowing on our revolving credit facility of  during  offset by a decrease of  in repayments of subordinated debt in compared to the remaining decrease in cash provided by financing activities is due to  less in proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options in offset by  in tax benefits recognized on the exercise of stock options and  in cash used for payment of debt issuance costs in borrowing on our credit facility decreased in due to our ability to use cash provided by operations to pay for affiliations in to a greater extent than repayments of subordinated debt decreased in due to the fact that we have not used subordinated debt as consideration for affiliations since in september  we increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility from  to  and extended the maturity from february to september  expecting to use this increased capacity for general corporate purposes  including working capital  acquisitions and affiliations and capital expenditures 
borrowings under the credit facility at the time were at prime rate or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin was based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranged from to for prime borrowings and 
table of contents to for libor borrowings 
in addition  on may   we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge  of borrowings under the credit facility 
under this arrangement  we have effectively converted our month  floating libor interest rate exposure  plus a credit spread  to fixed  plus a credit spread  until february through december  we also paid a commitment fee on the unused balance of our credit facility ranging from to 
borrowings were limited to an availability formula based on earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for certain items  and are secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  and we had stand by letters of credit amounting to approximately  at december  in september  we entered into a term loan agreement in the amount of  the term loan was used to finance the metro acquisition and pay down a portion of our outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
the maturity date of the term loan was september  interest on the term loan was at prime or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin for the first days was basis points  and increased basis points each days thereafter 
all of the obligations under this term loan facility rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the obligations of our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the jury s verdict in the trial associated with the litigation between pdg and us see litigation settlement  our lenders notified us on december  that an event of default under our revolving credit facility and term loan had occurred 
on december   we entered into a forbearance agreement under which the lenders agreed not to exercise certain of their default related rights and remedies  including acceleration of the maturity of the loans 
the lenders also agreed to continue making loans and issue letters of credit under our revolving credit facility of up to an aggregate principal amount of  rather than making loans under our revolving credit facility and term loan at the default interest rate allowed for in the credit agreements  the lenders agreed to make such loans at libor plus basis points 
on january   we entered into amended and restated forbearance agreements with our lenders under which they agreed to release the collateral under the loan agreements necessary for us to meet the obligations of the settlement agreement and agreed to continue making loans and issue letters of credit up to an aggregate principal amount of  on february   we entered into agreements to amend our revolving credit facility and term loan 
the agreements replaced the amended and restated forbearance agreements and waived existing defaults 
pursuant to the agreements  the revolving credit facility has a capacity of  the term loan facility has  outstanding 
both facilities will mature on june   and at current leverage levels  the company will borrow on both facilities at the libor rate plus basis points 
the amended facilities will permit the company to borrow up to  annually for capital expenditures   annually for acquisitions and up to  for earnout and contingent payments on previously completed acquisitions  subject to a maximum debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio of x 
the amendments to the revolving credit facility and term loan became effective upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the settlement agreement 
our growth to date has resulted in large measure from our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
historically  we have used a combination of cash  debt and  to a lesser extent  common stock as consideration for past affiliations 
in recent years  the consideration paid has consisted of cash 
we intend to continue to use cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility to provide funding for future affiliations  subject to the limitations contained in the credit facilities 
if cash flow from operations is not sufficient or debt financing is not available as needed on terms acceptable to us  we may have to issue or sell equity securities or  if unsuccessful  modify our affiliation strategy 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental practices that would expand our business as well as possible acquisitions of businesses that would broaden our business capabilities 
the number of practice affiliations over the next twelve months is expected to be at levels less than we have achieved during each of the past two years 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  affiliations and acquisitions for at least the next year 

table of contents contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total thereafter long term debt revolving credit facility and term loan operating leases uncertain tax positions total in addition to these contractual obligations  future interest payments relating to our long term debt are fixed at rates between and and are due as follows in  in  in future interest obligations relating to our revolving credit facility and term loans are not determinable as the interest rates are variable and the agreements do not include a required principal repayment schedule 
in we hedged  of our market interest rate exposure at plus a credit spread resulting in minimum expected payments of  per year through operating lease payments include amounts which are to be reimbursed to us pursuant to the terms of our service agreements with the affiliated practices 
the amounts to be reimbursed by the affiliated practices are  and are due as follows  in   in   in  and  thereafter 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with pdg see litigation settlement in which we agreed to transfer dental facilities  including associated assets and lease obligations  to pdg 
on february  these facilities were transferred to pdg and we have no future operating lease obligations associated with these facilities 
as of march   the future operating lease obligations are due as follows  in   in   in and  thereafter 
furthermore  the operating lease payments for the transferred dental facilities were reimbursable to us pursuant to the terms of the service agreement with pdg which was terminated on december  consequently  as of march  the amounts to reimbursed by the affiliated practices are  and are due as follows  in   in   in  and  thereafter 
uncertain tax positions are taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december  the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the thereafter column as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of goodwill  receivables due from affiliated practices  other intangible assets  loss reserves for our captive insurance company  and contingent accruals for litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and in certain instances actuarial studies conducted by third parties  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable the company s carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated practices  that have entered into service agreements with us  requires management to assess the collectability of our business service fees 
our service fees are dependent on the economic viability of the affiliated practices based on actual and expected future financial performance including collectability of the affiliated practices patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
although we reserved  of receivables due from pdg pursuant to the settlement agreement  to date we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from affiliated practices 
the affiliated practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at patient revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts where there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
the affiliated practices provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
in the event that final reimbursement or bad debt experience differs from original estimates  adjustments to the affiliated practices patient receivables would be required 
intangible assets the company s affiliations with dental group practices as a result of the parties entering into a service agreement are not business combinations  and as such  do not result in recognition of goodwill 
the company recognizes capitalized service agreement costs which are accounted for as definite lived intangible assets acquired in affiliations other than a business combination  and recorded at fair value 
in determining the fair value of a service agreement recognized in connection with an affiliation  management estimates the timing  amount and value of future expected cash flows 
these service agreements have contractual terms of years but the asset is generally amortized on a straight line basis over a period of years 
in the event a service agreement is terminated  the related affiliated practice is required  at the company s option in nearly all instances  to purchase the remaining unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value  purchase other assets at the greater of fair value or book value  and assume leases and other liabilities related to the performance of the company s obligations under the service agreement 
customer relationship intangible assets associated with the acquisition of dental laboratories are amortized on a straight line basis over years 
customer relationship intangible assets associated with the acquisition of tooth doctor are amortized over five years on an accelerated basis 
intangible assets assigned to tradename as a result of the acquisition of tooth doctor are indefinite lived and not amortized 
the tradename intangible asset associated with acquisition of metro is amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the intangible assets may be impaired by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows of the asset to its carrying value 
if impairment were determined  an appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset would be made to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
fair value is determined by calculating the projected discounted operating net cash flows of the asset using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
the company has not recorded any impairment charges or write downs on definite lived intangibles as of december  insurance we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our business  including property  business interruption and general liability  among others 
in addition  the affiliated practices are required to maintain  or 
table of contents cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
certain of our insurances are reinsured by a wholly owned captive insurance company licensed in the state of vermont 
while we believe that our current insurance coverages are adequate for our current operations  they may not be sufficient for all future claims 
in addition  the costs  retention levels and availability of certain insurance have fluctuated significantly in recent years  and there can be no assurance that our current insurance coverage will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost in the future or that reserve levels of our captive insurance company for potential losses below applicable retention levels under certain insurance coverage will be sufficient 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected life  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected life volatility  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in these assumptions for future stock option grants can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation

we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
in addition  we have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to fix the interest rate on  of our long term debt borrowings 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year  based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility and term loan  for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum
