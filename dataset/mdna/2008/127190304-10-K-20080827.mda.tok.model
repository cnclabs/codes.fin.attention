item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read together with  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
unless otherwise specifically noted  all years refer to our fiscal year which ends on june overview we are a leading provider of professional services and information technology solutions to the us government 
we derived percent of our revenues during the year ended june  from contracts with us government agencies  including percent from dod customers  and percent from us federal civilian agency customers including the department of homeland security 
we also provide services to state and local governments and commercial customers 

table of contents for the year ended june   approximately percent of our us government revenue was from contracts where we were the lead  or prime  contractor 
our contract base has approximately active contracts and more than  active task orders 
for the year ended june   no single task order or contract accounted for more than percent of our revenues 
we have a diverse mix of contract types  with percent  percent  and percent of our revenues for the year ended june   derived from time and materials  cost plus and fixed price contracts  respectively 
we generally do not pursue fixed price software development contracts that may create financial risk 
in the near term  we face some uncertainties due to the current business environment 
we continue to experience a number of protests of major contract awards 
in addition  many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specific levels of education  work experience  and security clearances 
depending on the level of clearance  security clearances can be difficult and time consuming to obtain and competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense 
in addition  a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty  or to decide not to exercise options to renew contracts 
among the factors that could affect our federal government contracting business are the continued demand and priority of funding for combat operations in iraq and afghanistan  an increase in set asides for small businesses  and budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending in general 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the following are considered our critical accounting policies revenue recognition contract accounting we generate almost all of our revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost plus fee contracts that include performance based fee incentives  and that are subject to the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
for such cost plus fee contracts subject to the provisions of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered for services provided  to the extent of material cost for products delivered to customers  and to the extent of expenses incurred on behalf of the customers 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customers are recognized as revenue at the time products are delivered to the customers 
we have four basic categories of fixed price contracts fixed unit price  fixed price level of effort  fixed price completion  and fixed price license 
revenue on fixed unit price contracts  where specified units of output under service arrangements are delivered  is recognized as units are delivered based on the specified price per unit 
revenue on fixed unit price maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the service period 
revenue for fixed price level of effort contracts is recognized based upon the number of units of labor actually delivered multiplied by the agreed rate for each unit of labor 

table of contents a significant portion of our fixed price completion contracts involve the design and development of complex client systems 
for these contracts that are within the scope of sop  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope of sop  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service period 
our fixed price license agreements and related services contracts are primarily executed in our international operations 
as the agreements to deliver software require significant production  modification or customization of software  revenue is recognized using the contract accounting guidance of sop for agreements to deliver data under license and related services  revenue is recognized as the data is delivered and services are performed 
except for losses on contracts accounted for under sab  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined 
losses on contracts accounted for under sab are recognized as the services and materials are provided 
our contracts may include the provision of more than one of our services 
in these situations  we apply the guidance of fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  for applicable arrangements  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values  with proper consideration given to the guidance provided by other authoritative literature 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  subcontracting costs  and other direct costs  as well as an allocation of allowable indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees for certain contracts may also be a factor in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business  and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods are material 
for our federal contracts  we follow us government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts 
due to the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business operations personnel conduct periodic contract status and performance reviews 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any significant changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business operations personnel performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the dcaa 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
we have a formal review process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 

table of contents costs of revenue costs of revenue include all direct contract costs as well as indirect overhead costs and selling  general and administrative expenses that are allowable and allocable to contracts under federal procurement standards 
costs of revenue also include costs and expenses that are unallowable under applicable procurement standards  and thus are not allocable to contracts for billing purposes 
such costs and expenses do not directly generate revenues  but are necessary for business operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts management establishes bad debt reserves against certain billed receivables based upon the latest information available to determine whether invoices are ultimately collectible 
whenever judgment is involved in determining the estimates  there is the potential for bad debt expense and the fair value of accounts receivable to be misstated 
given that we primarily serve the us government and that  in our opinion  we have sufficient controls in place to properly recognize revenue  we believe the risk to be relatively low that a misstatement of accounts receivable would have a material impact on our financial results 
accounts receivable balances are written off when the balance is deemed uncollectible after exhausting all reasonable means of collection 
goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to assess whether indications of impairment exist 
if indications of impairment are determined to exist  the second step of measuring impairment is performed  wherein the fair value of the relevant reporting unit is compared to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is impaired 
we perform our annual testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as of june of each year 
based on testing performed as of june   there were no indications of impairment 
stock based compensation we issue stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars non qualified stock options nqsos through may and shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus  on an annual basis to our directors and key employees under our stock incentive plan 
we also issue equity instruments in the form of rsus under our management stock purchase plan and director stock purchase plan 
with the exception of ssars that were granted in june and july of to the company s chief executive officer  president  us operations  and chief operating officer  us operations with a market based vesting feature  compensation expense attributable to ssars and nqsos is generally computed using the black scholes valuation model 
ssars containing market based vesting features were valued with a binomial lattice model 
assumptions relating to volatility are based on an analysis of our historical volatility 
through june   assumptions related to the expected term of nqsos were based on a safe harbor approach which allowed companies to assume an expected term at the mid point between the end of the vesting period and the final expiration of the nqsos 
beginning with ssars issued during the year ended june   the safe harbor is no longer permissible and the 
table of contents expected term of ssars issued during the year ended june  was based on an analysis of our historical nqso exercises 
the expected lives of future grants of ssars containing market based vesting features  if any  will be based on both historical exercise trends and expected exercise rates at various stock price levels 
under the terms of current ssar stock option and rsu restricted stock agreements  grantees retiring at or after age will vest in percent of their awards 
we recognize the expense associated with stock options  ssars  restricted stock and rsus granted to employees who have reached age in full at the time of grant 
we recognize the expense associated with stock options  ssars  restricted stock and rsus granted to employees nearing retirement age ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date the grantee is eligible for retirement 
this treatment is referred to as the non substantive vesting method and is applied even if the employee has remained or plans to remain an employee of the company beyond the eligible retirement age 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue 
consolidated statements of operations years ended june    year to year change to to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars percent dollar amounts in thousands revenue costs of revenue direct costs indirect costs and selling expenses depreciation and amortization total costs of revenue income from operations interest expense  net net income before income taxes income taxes net income revenue for fy  our total revenue increased by million  or percent 
approximately percent  or million  of revenue growth was organic and resulted from an increase in services provided to a broad base of dod  intelligence  and federal civilian agency customers 
the remaining percent increase  or million  was from acquisitions completed in fy and fy during fy  total revenue increased by million  or percent 
approximately percent  or million  of revenue growth was organic and resulted primarily from increases in services and solutions 
table of contents provided to our dod customers 
the remaining percent  or million  of the fy revenue growth was generated by acquisitions completed in fy and fy revenue generated from the date a business is acquired through the first anniversary of that date is considered acquired revenue 
our acquired revenue for fy and fy is as follows in millions business acquired the wexford group international  inc wgi athena innovative solutions  inc ais dragon development corporation ddc institute for quality management  inc iqm information systems support  inc iss alphainsight national security research  inc nsr others total the following table summarizes revenue earned by each of the customer groups for the three most recent fiscal years year ended june  dollar amounts in thousands department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial and other state and local governments total revenue from dod customers increased percent  or million  to billion for fy as compared to fy the aforementioned acquisitions accounted for percent of this total growth  contributing million 
dod revenue includes that earned for services provided to the us army  our largest customer  where our services focus on supporting readiness  tactical military intelligence  and communications of the combat operations in iraq and afghanistan 
dod revenue also includes work with the us navy  such as services to support the navy s automatic identification technologies and a mine countermeasure program that protects its fleet 
revenue from dod customers increased percent  or million  to billion for fy as compared to fy the aforementioned acquisitions accounted for percent of this growth  contributing million 
revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  or percent  to million during fy as compared to fy the primary revenue growth drivers in this area came from acquisitions  which accounted for percent of the increase 
approximately percent of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from the department of justice doj  for whom we provide litigation support services 
revenue from doj was million in fy versus million in fy the increase in revenue earned from doj resulted primarily from services provided to support doj efforts involving litigation resulting from hurricane katrina 
federal civilian agency revenue also includes services provided to non dod national intelligence agencies 

table of contents during fy as compared to fy  revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  or percent  to million 
the primary revenue growth drivers in this area came from acquisitions  which accounted for percent of the increase 
approximately percent of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from doj 
revenue from doj was million in fy versus million in fy the decrease in revenue earned from doj resulted primarily from the reduced level of services provided to support both doj litigation efforts involving the tobacco industry and the department of energy 
commercial and other revenue increased percent  or million  to million in fy as compared to fy commercial revenue is derived from both international and domestic operations 
in fy  international operations accounted for percent  or million  of the total commercial revenue  while domestic operations accounted for percent  or million 
the increase in commercial revenue was primarily from our operations in the uk  which increased by percent  or million 
growth in the uk was generated by three acquisitions completed in fy and favorable exchange rates 
commercial revenue increased percent  or million  to million in fy as compared to fy in fy  international operations accounted for percent  or million  of the total commercial revenue  while domestic operations accounted for percent  or million 
the increase in commercial revenue was primarily from our uk operations  which increased by percent  or million 
growth in the uk was generated by two acquisitions completed in fy and favorable exchange rates 
revenue from state and local governments decreased by percent  or million during fy  as compared to fy in fy as compared to fy  revenue from state and local governments decreased by percent  or million 
these decreases are attributable to a decreased demand for our information technology services that were provided across a number of states 
revenue from state and local governments represented percent and percent of our total revenue in fy and fy  respectively 
our continued focus on dod and federal civilian agency opportunities has resulted in a relatively reduced emphasis on state and local government business 
income from operations operating income increased percent  or million  in fy as compared to fy our operating margin in fy was percent compared to percent a year earlier 
the decline in income from operations as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in subcontract labor and materials as a percent of total direct costs 
these generate a lower margin than our direct labor 
in fy as compared to fy  operating income decreased percent  or million 
our operating margin in fy was percent  compared to percent a year earlier 
this decrease in margin rate also relates primarily to an increase in subcontract labor and materials as a percent of total direct costs 
during the fiscal years ended june    and  as a percentage of revenue  total direct costs were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the year to year increases in direct costs as a percentage of revenue have been driven primarily by an increase in the use of subcontractors 
these costs are common in our industry  are typically incurred in response to specific client tasks  and may vary from period to period 
the single largest component of direct costs  direct labor  was million  million and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the increase in direct labor during the last three fiscal years is attributable to the organic growth in our federal government business both in the dod and federal civilian agencies  and to acquisitions 
other direct costs  which include  among other costs  subcontractor labor and materials along with equipment purchases and travel expenses  were million  million  and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the year over year increases were primarily the result of increased volume of tasking across all of our major service offerings including the aforementioned acquisitions 

table of contents indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits  marketing and bid and proposal costs  indirect labor and other discretionary costs 
as a percentage of revenue  indirect costs and selling expenses were percent  percent and percent for fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the fluctuation in percentage experienced during these fiscal years is primarily the result of integrating acquired businesses while controlling our various indirect and general and administrative expenses in these periods of growth 
a component of indirect costs and selling expenses is stock compensation 
total stock compensation expense was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
the increase in stock compensation expense from fy to fy was due to a higher level of grants in fy as compared to fy depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or percent  in fy as compared to fy the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the identifiable intangible assets acquired with the business combinations completed during fy and fy in fy as compared to fy  depreciation and amortization expense increased million or percent primarily from the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
net interest expense increased million  or percent in fy  as compared to fy the primary driver for the increase was the issuance of million of convertible notes in may this increase was partially offset by lower interest on the credit facility due to a lower effective interest rate and interest income generated from cash on hand 
net interest expense increased million  or percent  in fy as compared to fy the primary driver for the increase was an approximate percent increase in the weighted average interest rate  excluding the effects of two interest rate swap agreements  of our average borrowings 
net interest expense also increased as a result of the issuance of million of convertible notes in may the effective income tax rates in fy  fy  and fy  were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the higher tax rate in fy as compared to fy related primarily to the impact of non deductible losses on corporate owned life insurance policies and lower research and development credits in fy due to the expiration of internal revenue code section as of december  these were partially offset by a reduction in state tax expense related to a review that resulted in recording additional state deferred tax assets 
quarterly financial information quarterly financial data for the two most recent fiscal years is provided in note  quarterly financial data  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
effects of inflation based on our contract mix reported for fy  approximately percent of our business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which automatically adjust revenue to cover costs that are affected by inflation 
approximately percent of our revenue is earned under time and material contracts  where labor rates for many of the services provided are often fixed for several years 
under certain time and material contracts containing indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity procurement arrangements  we do adjust labor rates annually as permitted 
the remaining portion of our business is fixed price and may span multiple years 
we generally have been able to price our time and materials and fixed price contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our positive cash flow from operations and our available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fund our operational needs 
cash flows from operations totaled 
table of contents million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
effective may   we issued the notes  which mature on may   in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of the notes are subordinate to our senior secured debt  and interest on the notes is payable on may and november of each year 
the registration statement we filed with the sec to register resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes became effective on october  holders may convert their notes at a conversion rate of shares of caci common stock for each  of note principal an initial conversion price of per share under the following circumstances if the last reported sale price of caci stock is greater than or equal to percent of the conversion price for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five consecutive business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period the note measurement period in which the average of the trading price per  principal amount of convertible note was equal to or less than percent of the average product of the closing price of a share of our common stock and the conversion rate of each date during the note measurement period  upon the occurrence of certain corporate events  as defined  or during the last three month period prior to maturity 
we are required to satisfy percent of the principal amount of these notes solely in cash  with any amounts above the principal amount to be satisfied in common stock 
as of june   none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied 
in the event of a fundamental change  as defined  holders may require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to the principal amount plus any accrued interest 
also  if certain fundamental changes occur prior to maturity  we will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock or  in lieu thereof  we may in certain circumstances elect to adjust the conversion rate and related conversion obligation so that these notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes 
the contingently issuable shares are not included in our diluted share count for the fiscal year ended june  or  because our average stock price during those periods was below the conversion price 
debt issuance costs of approximately million are being amortized to interest expense over seven years 
upon closing of the sale of the notes  approximately million of the net proceeds was used to concurrently repurchase one million shares of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we purchased in a private transaction at a cost of million call options the call options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at a price equal to the conversion price of per share 
the call options allow us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would pay the holders of the notes upon conversion 
for income tax reporting purposes  the notes and the call options are integrated 
this creates an original issue discount for income tax reporting purposes  and therefore the cost of the call options will be accounted for as interest expense over the term of the notes for income tax reporting purposes 
the associated income tax benefit of million to be realized for income tax reporting purposes over the term of the notes was reflected as an increase in additional paid in capital and a long term deferred tax asset 
in addition  we sold warrants the warrants to issue approximately million shares of caci common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the proceeds from the sale of the warrants totaled million 
on a combined basis  the call options and the warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution of caci s common stock in the event that the notes are converted by effectively increasing the conversion price of 
table of contents these notes from to 
the call options are anti dilutive and are therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding 
the warrants will result in additional diluted shares outstanding if our average common stock price exceeds 
the call options and the warrants are separate and legally distinct instruments that bind us and the counterparties and have no binding effect on the holders of the notes 
in may  the fasb issued fsp this new standard will require the company to separately account for the liability and equity conversion option components of the notes  and to recognize interest expense on the notes using an interest rate in effect for comparable debt instruments that do not contain conversion features 
the interest rate to be used under the new standard will be significantly higher than the rate which is currently used  which is equal to the coupon rate of percent 
fsp is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning july   and will require retrospective application to the date the notes were issued 
had this new standard been effective for the fiscal year ended june   the company estimates that its interest expense would have increased by approximately million  and its diluted earnings per share would have decreased by approximately per share 
fsp will have no direct effect on the company s cash flow 
we also maintain a million credit facility the credit facility  which includes a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility  and a million institutional term loan the term loan 
the initial borrowings under the credit facility were million  of which million was outstanding under the term loan at june  the revolving facility is a five year  secured facility that permits continuously renewable borrowings of up to million  with annual sublimits on amounts borrowed for acquisitions 
the revolving facility contains an accordion feature under which the facility may be expanded to million with current lenders of the revolving facility by providing advanced written notice to the administrative agent or we could solicit new lenders with agent approval 
the revolving facility permits one  two  three and six month interest rate options 
we pay a fee on the unused portion of this facility 
repayment of any outstanding balance under the revolving facility  together with accrued interest thereon  is due in full may   at which time the revolving facility will terminate 
as of june   we had no borrowings under the revolving facility 
the term loan portion of the credit facility is a seven year secured facility under which principal payments are due in quarterly installments of million at the end of each fiscal quarter through march  and the balance of million is due in full on may  interest rates for both revolving facility and term loan borrowings are based on the london inter bank offered rate libor  or the higher of the prime rate  or federal funds rate  plus applicable margins 
margin and unused fee rates are determined quarterly based on our leverage ratios 
we are expected to operate within certain limits on leverage  net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios throughout the term of the credit facility 
the total costs associated with securing the credit facility  as amended  were approximately million  and are being amortized over the life of the credit facility 
we also have amounts due under a mortgage note payable that was assumed in january  and promissory notes payable issued in connection with the may acquisition of sophron 
the amount of reported principal due under the mortgage note payable and the promissory notes payable were million and million  respectively  as of june  the promissory notes payable mature on june   but portions of these notes may be put back to the company beginning january  the holders have the right to request payment of up to percent of outstanding note principal beginning january   and up to percent at any time between april  and the stated due date of june  we also maintain two lines of credit in addition to the revolving facility  one in the uk  and one under a joint venture 
the total amount available under the line of credit facility in the uk  which is scheduled to expire 
table of contents in december  is approximately million 
the amount available under the joint venture s line of credit is million  and is scheduled to expire in september as of june   the company had million outstanding under the joint venture s line  and no borrowings under the uk s line 
in june  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
repurchases may take place from time to time on the open market  which may include the use of b trading plans or through negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of purchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
the program does not require us to purchase any specific number or amount of shares 
we may suspend the program at any time without notice 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the acquisitions completed in fy in addition  cash and cash equivalents at june  included million of cash paid in july in connection with the acquisition of wgi 
working capital was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
our operating cash flow was million for fy  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the current year decrease in operating cash flow results from strong organic growth in fy increasing organic growth consumes operating cash flow that is necessary to fund expanding business operations 
days sales outstanding improved to at june   compared to for the same period a year ago 
we used million and million of cash in investing activities during fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in fy was attributed to the larger acquisitions completed during fy as compared to those completed in fy in addition  although the wgi acquisition was completed in fy  million of the purchase price was paid in fy purchases of office and computer related equipment of million and million in fy and fy  respectively  accounted for a majority of the remaining funds used in investing activities 
we have relatively low capital expenditure requirements for our business  and expect these expenditures in the coming years to remain consistent with the levels reported in recent fiscal years 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
during fy financing activities reflect the sale of the notes 
we used million of cash from the sales of the notes to repurchase one million shares of our common stock 
cash flows from financing activities continued to benefit from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  and purchases of stock under our espp 
proceeds from these activities totaled million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
these were offset by cash used to purchase stock to fulfill obligations under the espp 
cash used to acquire stock under the espp was million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to the use of shares held in treasury to fulfill the company s obligations under the espp for the second and third quarters of fy we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available bank borrowings  and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on going operations  customary capital expenditures  debt service obligations  and other working capital requirements over the next twelve months 
over the longer term  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations necessary to fulfill the obligations under our credit facility and the notes will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by many factors outside of our control 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we use off balance sheet arrangements to finance the lease of operating facilities 
with the exception of a building acquired in connection with an acquisition completed during the year ended june   we have 
table of contents financed the use of all of our office and warehouse facilities through operating leases 
operating leases are also used to finance the use of computers  servers  phone systems  and to a lesser extent  other fixed assets  such as furnishings  that are obtained in connection with business acquisitions 
we generally assume the lease rights and obligations of companies acquired in business combinations and continue financing equipment under operating leases until the end of the lease term following the acquisition date 
we generally do not finance capital expenditures with operating leases  but instead finance such purchases with available cash balances 
for additional information regarding our operating lease commitments  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
the credit facility provides for stand by letters of credit aggregating up to million that reduce the funds available under the revolving facility when issued 
as of june   we had no outstanding letters of credit 
we have no other material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  that require us to make future cash payments payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands contractual obligations term loan fixed rate note convertible notes joint venture credit facility operating leases other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap other notes payable deferred compensation total see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters

this liability is substantially offset by investments held by the plan provider to be reimbursed to us upon the payment of the liability to the plan participant 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the interest rates on both the term loan and the revolving facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
a one percent change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in our interest expense fluctuating by approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  we seek to manage these fluctuations  in part  through interest rate hedging agreements 
as of june   we were party to two interest rate swap agreements and one interest rate cap agreement with a total notional amount of debt of million that provide fixed rate payments in lieu of floating rate payments 
we continue to monitor market conditions to determine if additional interest rate swap or cap agreements are appropriate 
approximately percent and percent of our total revenues in fy and fy  respectively  were derived from our international operations in the uk our practice in the uk is to negotiate contracts in the same currency in which the predominant expenses are incurred  thereby mitigating the exposure to foreign 
table of contents currency exchange fluctuations 
it is not possible to accomplish this in all cases  thus  there is some risk that profits will be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
as of june  we held pounds sterling in the uk equivalent to approximately million 
this allows us to better utilize our cash resources on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries  thereby mitigating foreign currency conversion risks
