table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview was another year of record results for us  with higher revenues  profits and cash flows than our company has ever experienced 
our acquisitions along with the acquisitions of emj and yarde metals contributed significantly to our financial results 
we completed five acquisitions during that were important in further expanding and diversifying our product  customer and geographic base  both domestically and internationally 
we significantly increased our exposure in canada through an acquisition that services the western canada energy market 
we also made our first entry into the united kingdom through an acquisition that provided us the opportunity to expand our european presence 
near the end of we opened a facility in china to service a sector of the semiconductor industry 
these activities better position us to meet the needs of our customers that are expanding their businesses globally 
we spent million on capital expenditures in  with a significant portion of that amount relating to growth initiatives  including the expansion and relocation of existing facilities  enhancing and adding processing capabilities  penetrating new geographic markets and expanding product offerings at existing locations 
we continue to focus on growing our company with accretive acquisitions and internal growth activities that enhance our product  geographic and customer diversity 
we believe this diversification makes our financial results less cyclical than others in our industry 
we generated record cash flow from operations of million in due to the increased size of the company  strong profit levels and effective working capital management 
during we used our cash flow from operations to fund our million of capital expenditures  million of acquisitions and million of stock repurchases and were able to repay a portion of our outstanding debt 
this resulted in a net debt to total capital ratio of and million outstanding on our billion credit facility at december  this strong financial position provides us with ready and adequate access to capital to continue our growth activities 
demand for most products that we sell was healthy during  although not at the strong levels that we experienced in  especially for products that we sell to the non residential construction and aerospace markets 
pricing was somewhat volatile for most products that we sell during overall  prices for metal products have been at relatively high levels since in  domestic prices for metals were supported by a historically low level of imported metals into the us the strong global demand and pricing for metal products caused metals to be re routed to these stronger foreign markets in stainless steel products experienced the most pricing volatility in in stainless steel prices reached unprecedented levels that rose even further in the first half of with these increases mainly due to global shortages of nickel 
in the third quarter of this trend reversed suddenly with significant price reductions that caused our gross profit margins on sales of these products to deteriorate 
prices for stainless steel products have been more stable since then  but could experience further significant fluctuations in the future 
also in  there were significant competitive pressures in our industry  especially in the first half of the year  due to inventory destocking that pressured our selling prices and gross profit margins 
we believe the steps that we took during the difficult years of through positioned us to take full advantage of the improved economic conditions we have experienced since however  as evidenced by our performance during the difficult years  we take the necessary actions to allow us to operate efficiently and profitably even in less favorable economies 
we believe this is because of our focus on cost controls and inventory turnover and our product  customer and geographic diversification 
our product and geographic diversification should continue to benefit us in we believe that demand levels may decline somewhat in due to general fears about the economy 
we are optimistic about pricing  with increases already in effect for many carbon steel products in early significant declines in demand or pricing for our products could reduce our gross profit margins 
also  if we cannot obtain a sufficient supply of metals for our customers in  or if domestic availability of our products increases significantly in  this could negatively impact our financial results  especially as compared to our results 
customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases our revenue dollars increase  which contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 

table of contents pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increases 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure  the impact on our results of operations from changes in pricing is much greater than the effect of volume changes 
also  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this could increase our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we can typically generate stronger levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
acquisitions effective october   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of metalweb plc metalweb  a metals service center company headquartered in birmingham  england

we paid in cash and issued 
of a share of reliance common stock for each share of emj common stock outstanding 
this is currently the only acquisition where we have used our stock as consideration 
emj s net sales for the year ended december  were approximately billion 

table of contents recent developments on january   we sold certain assets and business of the encore coils division of encore group limited  that we acquired on february  the encore coils division processed and distributed carbon steel flat rolled products through four facilities located in western canada 
the encore coils business did not fit well for us because we did not have any similar facilities nearby that could help support this relatively small business 
we were attracted to encore group because of its specialty bar and tube business  as well as its stainless products and exposure to the energy industry 
we have retained the encore metals and team tube divisions that participate in these markets 
in addition  one remaining facility of encore coils now operates as a toll processing facility 
in december we announced that our subsidiary valex corp 
opened a facility in the people s republic of china 
valex china co 
ltd 
is owned by the hong kong joint venture company valex holdings ltd 
valex corp 
owns of valex holdings ltd 
the facility is located in the nanhui district of shanghai and will produce ultra high purity tubes  fittings  and valves for the semiconductor  lcd and solar industries 
other developments in  our focus on organic growth continued and included the opening of new facilities  building or expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment with total capital expenditures of million 
phoenix metals company completed the construction of a new facility for its charlotte  north carolina operation and is adding processing equipment to better support its customers in that area 
phoenix metals company also leased warehouse space in russellville  arkansas to expand into the stainless steel market in that area

yarde metals  inc expanded its network geographically by leasing space in baltimore  maryland to store depot inventory 
the current competitive environment supports strong organic growth and we expect to continue to expand our business in by continuing to build and expand facilities and add processing equipment with a record capital expenditures budget for of million 
due to the increased size and growth activities of our company  late in we recapitalized the company by issuing million of debt securities and increasing the availability of our credit facility to billion to provide for our future growth 
we also repurchased approximately million of outstanding senior secured notes of emj to lower our cost of capital 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales gross profit s  g a expenses depreciation expense operating profit excludes other income  amortization expense  minority interest  interest expense and income tax expense 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our annual consolidated sales of billion were our highest ever  up from  with a increase in tons sold and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold our tons sold and average selling price per ton sold amounts exclude the sales of precision strip because of the toll processing nature of its business 
our acquisitions along with our acquisitions of emj on april  and yarde metals on august   contributed significantly to the increase in our sales levels 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of our and acquisitions  were billion in  up from  with a decrease in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
demand from most markets was relatively strong in  but down somewhat from our levels 
in  we experienced significant strength in sales of our products to the non residential construction and aerospace industries 
although we experienced various degrees of pricing volatility in all the metal products that we sell  with the most significant volatility in stainless steel products  overall pricing levels were above levels 
historically low levels of imported metal products into the us in contributed to the strength of domestic prices 
import levels were low due to foreign mills re routing their products to europe and asia where prices were higher due to the weak us dollar and strong global demand 
our average price on a consolidated basis increased somewhat due to a shift in our product mix from our and acquisitions 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of billion  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales level in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in the decline in our gross profit margin in was mainly due to significant competitive pressures during the year  especially in the first half  resulting from excess inventories throughout the industry 
a significant amount of this destocking by our competitors was in stainless steel products 
stainless steel costs were increasing significantly in the first half of and we can typically increase our gross profit margins in these environments  however  the destocking caused us to reduce our selling prices to compete  thereby reducing our gross profit margins 
in the third quarter  stainless steel costs experienced sudden and significant declines 
this adversely impacted our margins because we had to reduce our stainless steel selling prices more rapidly than our inventory costs on hand were reduced 
in the fourth quarter of  costs of most products were stable with third quarter levels  allowing us to realize some improvement in our gross profit margins from third quarter levels 
also  our lifo expense was lower in than in we recorded lifo expense  which is included in our cost of sales  of million during  compared to million in our lifo expense resulted mainly from the further increases in the cost of stainless steel products at year end compared to the beginning of the year  although at a much lower rate than in expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased million  or from mainly due to our and acquisitions and general cost increases 
the expenses as a percent of sales in were  the same as in the period 
we continue to focus on cost control and take appropriate cost reduction measures when needed 
depreciation expense increased million in mainly because of our and acquisitions and because of depreciation of our capital expenditures 
amortization expense increased million  or  because of the amortization of our intangibles from our and acquisitions 
operating profit 
operating profit  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating profit of million and an operating profit margin of 
the increased profit is mainly due to higher gross profit dollars resulting from increased sales levels  however  our operating profit margins deteriorated because of our lower gross profit margins in other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to increased borrowings to fund our acquisitions 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was compared to for the rate is slightly lower than the rate due to increased international exposure through our acquisitions and various tax credits that were available to us in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  an increase of  compared to billion in our acquisitions of emj and yarde metals in contributed significantly to our increased sales levels 
our sales include an increase in our tons sold of and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold of 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of our and acquisitions  were billion in  up from  with a increase in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 

table of contents our tons sold increased significantly because of our acquisitions but also increased on a same store basis due to strong demand throughout the year in most end markets that we sell to 
our average selling price per ton sold was up because of a shift to a greater percentage of higher value products due to our acquisitions and because of increased pricing for most products that we sell compared to levels  especially for stainless steel products 
the acquisitions of emj and yarde metals significantly increased our stainless steel exposure with sales of stainless and alloy steel products representing of our sales  compared to of our sales 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of billion  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales level in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in in our gross profit margins declined somewhat due to our acquisitions and because of competitive pressure on sales of carbon steel products late in the year 
our same store gross profit margin was 
also  our lifo expense was significantly higher than in we recorded lifo expense of million during  compared to million in our lifo expense in resulted mainly from the increased costs of stainless steel and aluminum products and higher quantities of inventory on hand at year end compared to the beginning of the year because of improved demand levels for most products 
expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased million  or from mainly due to our and acquisitions and additional selling expenses from our increased sales levels 
the expenses as a percent of sales in were compared to in the period 
the decrease in our s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales was due mainly to our increased prices and effective expense control 
depreciation expense increased million in mainly because of our and acquisitions and because of depreciation of our capital expenditures 
our amortization expense increased million in mainly because of our acquisitions 
operating profit 
operating profit  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating profit of million and an operating profit margin of 
the increased profit is mainly due to higher gross profit dollars resulting from increased sales levels  along with our effective expense control 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to increased borrowings to fund our acquisitions 
minority interest expense decreased in compared to mainly due to our purchase of the remaining minority interest in american steel  llc effective january   we own of american steel 
because of this change in ownership  we no longer record minority interest expense for american steel 
our minority interest expense consists of the net income for the approximately of valex corp 
and the of valex korea that we do not own  and also for the of everest metals that we do not own 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in  down from in  mainly due to slightly higher international profits that are taxed at lower rates and tax benefits carried over from emj 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our working capital was billion  unchanged from the december  levels 
however  excluding the initial effect of acquisitions  we reduced our accounts receivable balance by million and our inventory levels by million in from our year end levels 
this was mainly due to somewhat lower demand levels in as compared to  especially in the fourth quarter  and also due to our continued focus on working capital management 
to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are our two most significant elements of working capital 
as of december   our days sales outstanding were approximately days  slightly improved from our december  rate of days 
we calculate our days sales outstanding as an average of the most recent two month period 
our inventory turn rate at december  was about times or months on hand  consistent with our rate 
as demand and pricing for our products increase or decrease  our working capital needs increase or decrease  respectively 
we expect to finance increases in our working capital needs through operating cash flow or with borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 

table of contents our primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and our revolving line of credit 
cash flow provided by operations increased to million in compared to million in when we were building working capital to support increased business levels 
our increased size and solid profit levels along with our effective working capital management in produced our strong cash flow from operations that funded our capital expenditures of approximately million  acquisitions of approximately million and stock repurchases of million during the year 
our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations at december  was billion  the same as at year end 
at december   we had million borrowed on our billion revolving line of credit 
our net debt to total capital ratio was at december   down from our year end rate of net debt to total capital is calculated as total debt  net of cash  divided by shareholders equity plus total debt  net of cash 
on january  we paid off a million private placement note that matured 
we also repurchased an additional million of our stock in early we funded the note payoff and stock repurchase with cash flow from operations and borrowings on our credit facility 
the significant availability on our credit facility and relatively low leverage position provides adequate liquidity for us to fund our growth activities 
on november   we entered into an indenture the indenture  for the issuance of million of unsecured debt securities which are guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect  wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and any entities that become such subsidiaries during the term of the indenture collectively  the subsidiary guarantors 
none of our foreign subsidiaries or our non wholly owned domestic subsidiaries is a guarantor 
the total debt issued was comprised of two tranches  a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  and b million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations 
in april  these notes were exchanged for publicly traded notes registered with the securities and exchange commission 
at our option  we may redeem all or part of the notes of either series at any time prior to their maturity by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments as defined in the indenture  plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to  but not including  the redemption date 
at december   we also had million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding senior notes bear interest at an average fixed rate of and have an average remaining life of years  maturing from to in  million of these notes mature  million of which we paid off in early january our billion syndicated credit facility and our senior notes require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio and include change of control provisions  among other things 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million for the year 
our capital expenditures are currently budgeted at approximately million  excluding acquisitions 
our budget includes several growth initiatives to expand or relocate existing facilities and to add or upgrade equipment 
any capital expenditure commitments that existed at december  are included in the below table of contractual obligations 
our capital and operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are also included in the contractual obligations table below 
our capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  debt repayments and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and materials handling and processing equipment 
on may  our board of directors declared a two for one stock split  in the form of a stock dividend on our common stock that was effective on july  on february   our board of directors declared a increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to 
per share of common stock 
in may  our board of directors amended and restated our stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional million shares of our common stock to be repurchased 
repurchased shares are treated as authorized but unissued shares 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share under our stock repurchase plan 
this was the first time that we had repurchased our stock since as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under the plan at an average cost of per share and had approximately million shares authorized for purchase under the plan 
in early  we repurchased approximately an additional million shares at an average cost per share of 
we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options during were million 

table of contents we anticipate that funds generated from operations and funds available under our billion credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and senior debt repayment needs in the near term 
we also anticipate that we will be able to fund acquisitions with borrowings under our line of credit 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by year in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total amounts include principal payments only 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding interest rates  payment dates and expected refinancing 
the majority of our material purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s defined benefit pension plans and serp plans for the next ten years 
these amounts are limited to the information provided by our actuaries 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 

table of contents goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill deemed to have indefinite lives is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
we measure possible impairment based on either significant losses of an entity or the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if impairment is identified  we would calculate the amount of such impairment based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
we have performed tests of goodwill as of november  and  and believe that the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and that no impairment currently exists 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues such as bankruptcy status  our past collection history  and current financial and credit agency reports 
accounts which we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and probable future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 

table of contents for information regarding our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions including those that may result from the american jobs creation act of  changes in our assessment of tax exposure items  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we have performed impairment testing in accordance with sfas no 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we estimate the reporting unit s fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires us to estimate income from operations based on historical results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
a key assumption made is that  in general  our revenues will grow at to per year  adjusted for the current economic outlook 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market we are able to react quickly to changes in metals pricing 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
volatility in these markets could impact our net income 
foreign currency transaction gains were approximately million during primarily related to our canadian operations and the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar during the exposure to foreign currency rates in relation to our canadian operations is limited to certain of their outstanding intercompany borrowings denominated in the us dollar which currently are not hedged 
we expect this exposure to decrease significantly during as the related outstanding balances have been paid down significantly during and early interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we do not currently anticipate repayment of our fixed rate long term debt prior to its scheduled maturities 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pretax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
based on million of variable rate debt outstanding on our syndicated credit facility as of december   a hypothetical one percent increase in interest rates would not result in a material impact to earnings
