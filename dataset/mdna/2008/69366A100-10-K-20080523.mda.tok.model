these purchase commitments are valued at approximately million at march  and are based on management s estimate of current pricing 

table of contents g as of march   the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million 
this amount is excluded from the table above as the company cannot reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the company periodically evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements  which are then reviewed by the company s audit committee 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions considered reasonable with the relevant facts and circumstances 
based on the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
the critical accounting estimates are those policies that relate to estimates that require the company s management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimates or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
additionally  the company includes those accounting policies whose initial application had a material impact on the company s financial presentation  unless the policy s application resulted solely from the issuance of new accounting literature 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician business  elder care business  and corporate shared services  unless otherwise noted 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade receivables resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from its customers 
the allowances include estimates of specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but may later become uncollectible 
management believes the estimates used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are critical accounting estimates because changes in credit worthiness and economic conditions  including bankruptcies in the elder care business  have had a material impact on operations in previous fiscal years and could continue to have an impact on the company s outstanding accounts receivable balances in the near future 
the estimates used to determine the allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  and changes in customer payment terms 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
adjustments to credit limits and allowances for bad debts are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or improve  allowances may be adjusted  impacting general and administrative expenses and the accounts receivable balance 
during fiscal years   and  the physician business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively  for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million  million and million  respectively 
over this time period  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has represented between and of the physician business gross accounts receivable balance 
at march  and march   the allowance for doubtful accounts for this business segment was million and million  respectively 
if management were to assume its reserve estimates at march  were based on the historic ranges noted above  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march  would range from million to million for the physician business 

table of contents during fiscal years   and  the elder business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively  for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million  million and million 
over this time period  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has represented between and of the elder care business gross accounts receivable balance 
at march  and march   the allowance for doubtful accounts for this business segment was million and million  respectively 
if management were to assume its reserve estimates at march  were based on the historic ranges noted above  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march  would range from million to million for the elder care business 
differences between the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march  and the range noted above represents improvements in the elder care business aged balances during fiscal year  as days sales outstanding have improved from days in fiscal year to days in fiscal year although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions  and changes in customer s credit worthiness could materially affect the company s financial results 
inventories in order to state inventories medical products  medical equipment  and other related products at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method or market net realizable value  the company maintains an allowance for excess or slow moving inventory based on the expectation that inventory will become obsolete  sold for less than cost  or become unsaleable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as historical trends  current market conditions and management s assessment of when the inventory would likely be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory would likely be sold in the normal course of business 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer could result in unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin and net income 
obsolete or damaged inventory is disposed of or written down to net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
additional adjustments  if necessary  are made based on management s specific review of inventory on hand 
management believes the estimates used in determining the allowance for excess and slow moving inventory are critical accounting estimates as changes in the estimates for both segments could have a material impact on net income and the estimates involve a high degree of judgment 
as part of the company s periodic review of the carrying amount of inventory during fiscal year  management determined that a write down of approximately million was required for excess influenza vaccine inventory resulting from the cancellation of customer orders due to an oversupply of the product in the market  and a mild influenza season as a result of the write down  cost of goods sold were increased by million during the fiscal year ended march   or million net of tax  in the physician business 
during fiscal year  the company did not participate in the influenza vaccine market  however  in future years  the company will participate in this market on a consignment basis and therefore not have inventory risk 
inventory allowances ranged from to of inventory for the physician business and to of inventory for the elder care business during the previous three fiscal years 
in preparing the financial statements for the year ended march   management estimated the allowance for excess or slow moving inventory to be approximately million and million for the physician business and elder care business  respectively 
if management were to assume the estimate of future inventory write offs were based on the historic ranges noted above  the allowance for excess and slow moving inventory as of march  would range from million to million for the physician business and million to million for the elder care business  impacting the company s inventory and gross profit balances 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to inventory reserves are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results 

table of contents vendor rebates the company receives transaction based rebates from third party suppliers 
such rebates are classified as a reduction to cost of goods sold in the accompanying statements of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
management establishes a reserve for uncollectible transaction based vendor rebates based on management s judgment after considering the status of current outstanding rebate claims  historical denial experience with suppliers  and any other pertinent available information 
management believes the estimates used in determining the reserve for uncollectible transaction based vendor rebates are critical accounting estimates because changes in the estimates for both segments could have a material impact on net income and the estimates involve a high degree of judgment 
reserves for transaction based rebates for the year ended march  were million 
historically  reserves ranged from to of the rebates receivable balance during the previous three fiscal years 
if management were to assume that the estimate of future rebate receivable write offs were changed to the upper and lower end of the range that was developed in the course of formulating the estimate  the transaction based rebate reserve as of march  would range from million to million  impacting the company s prepaid and other current assets and gross profit balances 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to vendor rebates are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results 
income taxes the company uses the liability method for determining its provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
under this method  the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  significant judgment and estimates are used as management considers short and long term forecasts of future taxable income as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these judgments and estimates include some degree of uncertainty and any changes could require management to adjust the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the company had gross deferred income tax assets of million and million at march  and march   respectively 
there were no valuation allowances as of march  and march   as management believes it will fully utilize the company s deferred tax assets 
the company s tax filings are periodically subject to review by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities  which may result in assessments of additional tax 
resolution of these situations  either with the taxing authority or the courts  inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly  the company provides taxes only for the amounts management believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
management s experience has been that the estimates and assumptions used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
during fiscal  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas no 
fin which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
this standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position 
table of contents may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes 
fin requires management to make significant judgments while assessing the probability of possible outcomes of future tax examinations 
upon adoption of fin  effective april   the company recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of million and a decrease to stockholders equity of approximately million 
at march   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million 
management does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
if our estimates or judgments described above were to change  a hypothetical increase decrease in our effective tax rate would have improved impaired consolidated income from continuing operations by approximately million in fiscal year estimating useful lives of computer hardware and software computer hardware and software is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
management must use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of its assets 
changes in circumstances  such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model  changes in the company s business strategy  or changes in the planned use of property and equipment  could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened or extended  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
in previous years  management has reviewed the estimated useful lives of certain computer hardware and software in connection with completing the implementation of the jd edwards enterprise resource planning erp system 
during fiscal year  management revised the estimated useful lives of certain assets  resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of million  net of tax  or approximately of diluted earnings per share  for the fiscal year ended march   million  net of tax  or approximately of diluted earnings per share  for the fiscal year ended march  and million  net of tax  or approximately of diluted earnings per share  for the fiscal year ended march  although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to the estimated useful lives of its computer hardware and software are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results 
computer hardware and software represented approximately million and million of the company s net property  plant  and equipment balance at march  and march   respectively 
depreciation expense on computer hardware and software equaled million  million  and million for the years ended march   march   and march   respectively 
as of march   the average useful life of the company s hardware and software was years 
if the average useful life of hardware and software were adjusted by months  depreciation expense at march  would be impacted by approximately million 
legal contingencies the company is party to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if information prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be estimated  an accrual for a loss contingency is established 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the 
table of contents amount accrued  disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 
management considers the estimates used in determining the company s exposure for legal contingencies as critical accounting estimates as management must use a high degree of judgment to determine the probability and amount of loss associated with each proceeding and any change in the estimate could result in a material impact on net income 
during fiscal year  the company s florida distribution operations were inspected by the florida department of health for compliance with recently enacted state drug pedigree legislation 
based on the results of these inspections  the company incurred and recorded approximately million relating to costs and fees  including potential loss of inventory  additional operating costs  legal costs and costs to modify and transition the company s compliance system and processes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reached an agreement with the florida department of health regarding the interpretation of the pedigree legislation 
during fiscal year  the company s accruals for estimated costs and fees  inventory loss and related expenses associated with the agreement to resolve issues with the state of florida were adequate 
management does not believe the outstanding legal proceedings at march   will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions related to the anticipated or actual outcome of any outstanding legal proceedings 
valuation of intangible assets  other long lived assets  and goodwill acquisitions the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in the valuation of acquired intangible assets include  but are not limited to i expected future cash flows from existing customer contracts and relationships  ii assumptions relating to the impact of noncompete agreements on business operations  iii assumptions related to the impact on the timing of expected future cash flows  iv retention of customers and key business leaders  and v the risk inherent in investing in intangible assets 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption  estimates  or other actual results 
for these reasons  management believes that the estimates used in determining the fair value of asset acquired through an acquisition are critical accounting estimates 
during the previous three fiscal years  the company has made acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
during fiscal year  the physician business acquired of the outstanding stock of activus healthcare solutions  inc activus  a california based distributor of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to office based physicians and ambulatory surgery centers 
net assets acquired were valued at million based on management s estimates of fair value 
adjustments to the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities subsequent to the date of purchase based on changes in management s original estimates were immaterial 
impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting unit annually on the last day of each fiscal year 
the impairment and disposal of long lived assets is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets  
table of contents such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
in conducting the impairment analysis  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which may include a discounted cash flow analysis requiring management to make certain assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  revenues  earnings  and other factors  including discount rates  to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
the application of different assumptions about such matters as estimated future cash flows or discount rates  or the testing for impairment at a different level of the organization or on a different organization structure  could produce materially different results 
for these reasons  management believes the estimates used in evaluating the company s goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  and long lived assets are critical accounting estimates 
as of march   march   and march   the company s intangible asset  other long lived asset  and goodwill balances totaled million  million  and million 
based on management s review  goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets were not impaired during fiscal years march   march   and march  and management does not believe there were any circumstances which indicated the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable during fiscal year additionally  a hypothetical swing in the discount rate utilized in the company s discounted cash flow analysis would not have indicated impairment for any of the company s reporting units 
long term incentive compensation equity incentive plans as of march   the company had grants of incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  time based restricted stock and performance based restricted stock outstanding under the equity incentive plans 
during fiscal year  the company accelerated the vesting of its incentive and nonqualified stock options 
there have been no issuances of stock options since the acceleration 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r applying the modified prospective method 
this statement requires all equity based payments to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
equity based compensation expense for time based and performance based restricted stock is recognized for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
estimates are required to determine the number of share based awards which will ultimately vest  and  in the case of performance based restricted stock  estimates of the company s earnings per share goals 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate  differences between actual and estimated forfeitures when an award vests or changes in estimates regarding the company s performance can have material effects on share based compensation expense 
for this reason  management has determined that the estimates used to determine equity based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates 
when estimating forfeitures  the company considers termination behaviors as well as trends of actual equity based awards forfeited 
management re assesses the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the required service period 
such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures 
as required  forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests 
actual forfeitures in the future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than management s current estimates  which could have a material impact on equity based compensation expense recognized in future years

cash based incentive plans the company maintains a cash based long term incentive plan  the shareholder value plan svp for the certain company executives 
the svp provides incentive to enhance shareholder value through the achievement of earnings per share goals outlined in the company s three year strategic plan 
the performance period under the current svp was the month period from april  to march  the company expects to enter into new long term cash based incentive plans based on performance during fiscal year estimates are required to determine the company s expected future performance and cumulative earnings per share at the end of the three year performance period 
changes in estimates regarding the company s performance can have a material effect on cash based incentive compensation expense 
for this reason  management has determined that the estimates used to determine the amounts accrued for cash based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates 
when estimating the company s earnings per share goals for the svp  the company reviews historical performance  internal plans  and other performance metrics 
these performance goals are re assessed throughout the service period 
such estimates are revised  if necessary  if they differ materially from the original assessment 
actual performance could be materially higher or lower than management s estimates  which could have a material impact on cash based compensation expense recognized in future years 
the company s three year performance period for the current svp ended on march   with an estimate payment of million 
the company accrued million and million within accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets as of march  and march   respectively 
the company expects payment during the first quarter of fiscal year self insurance accruals the company is self insured for employee healthcare  which includes medical and dental costs  however  the company maintains insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits 
the company estimates its liabilities for healthcare costs using current and historical claims data 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of existing claims change or historical trends are not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to record additional expense or reductions to expense that could be material to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
for these reasons  the company has determined that its self insurance accrual is a critical accounting estimate 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at march  and march  these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis and current payment trends 
the company 
table of contents records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period 
this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented 
if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month  the impact on pre tax earnings would be million 
if the amount of claims  medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated  the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required 
however  the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company s objective in managing market risk exposures is to identify and limit the potential impact of changes in interest rates  commodity availability  and access of capital on earnings and cash flow 
the following assessment of the company s market risk does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political uncertainty  economic uncertainty  impact of future tax legislation  and credit risks 
interest rate risk 
the company s primary interest rate exposure relates to cash and cash equivalents and fixed and variable rate debt 
during fiscal year  the company s debt obligations consisted of i million convertible senior notes with a fixed rate of and ii variable rate borrowings under the revolving line of credit  which bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin based on a fixed charge coverage ratio  or at libor plus an applicable margin based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
fixed charge coverage is determined by the ratio of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization to the sum of fixed charges  including but not limited to  interest expense  capital expenditures  payment of debt principal  and cash paid for taxes 
changes in interest rates affect interest payments under the company s variable rate revolving line of credit agreement 
the company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variable interest rate of its revolving line of credit 
during fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million swap 
under the terms of the swap  the company makes payments based on the fixed rate and will receive interest payments based on month libor which effectively fixes the notional amount covered by the swap at a borrowing rate of plus a credit spread 
during fiscal year  the company maintained an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million that matured on march  swap 
during the period outstanding  the swap effectively fixed the notional amount covered by the swap at a borrowing rate of plus a credit spread 
the changes in market value of these financial instruments are highly correlated with changes in market value of the hedged item both at inception and over the life of the agreement 
amounts received or paid under the interest rate swap agreement are recorded as reductions or additions to interest expense 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company s interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge with changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of march   the swap carries a notional principal amount of million and effectively fixes the interest rate on a portion of the revolving line of credit to  prior to applying the applicable margin discussed above 
the swap agreement expires on february  and settles monthly until expiration 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded an unrealized loss  net of tax  of approximately million for the estimated fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts 

table of contents during fiscal year  the company had average daily variable rate borrowings under its line of credit of million 
a hypothetical increase decrease in prevailing interest rates at march   would result in a corresponding decrease increase in interest expense of approximately million 
currency risk 
the company s currency rate exposures relate to products that are globally sourced from manufacturers primarily in southeast asia 
currently  the company has negotiated settlement of payments to manufacturers in us dollars 
however  over time  local country currency fluctuations may increase or decrease the negotiated cost that the company must pay for these products 
in addition  the company may in future periods negotiate settlement of payments to manufacturers in the local currency of the country providing a product which would then subject the company to foreign currency risk 
commodity risk 
the company s primary commodity exposures relate to fluctuations in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel and the procurement of certain medical supplies in which the product cost is dependent upon the price of raw materials 
the company s direct fuel exposure relates to fluctuations in fuel costs that affect the company leased delivery fleet or third party delivery charges 
significant increases in the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel have impacted  and may continue to impact  the company s gross margin  cost to deliver  and the operating costs of third part transportation providers 
some of these common carriers have passed these increases through to the company in the form of a fuel surcharge  which has had an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company implemented a fuel surcharge to its customers during fiscal year to pass on a portion of the increased cost of gasoline and diesel fuel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully pass along further significant increases in fuel costs to its customers due to the competitive nature of the medical supply distribution industry 
from march to march  the us national average for unleaded gasoline increased from to  a cumulative annual growth rate of 
during the same period  the us national average for diesel fuel increased from gallon to gallon  a cumulative annual growth rate of 
with respect to the company s direct fuel purchases  a hypothetical increase decrease in diesel and unleaded fuel costs during fiscal would have resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in fuel expense of approximately million 
the company purchases latex and vinyl gloves in which the pricing of the gloves is based on the price of latex as traded on the malaysian rubber exchange and the weighted price of two raw materials  poly vinyl chloride pvc and dioctylphthalate dop  as published on www 
icis 
com 
latex  pvc  and dop in their raw form are only one of many components used on the manufacture of gloves 
however  based on estimates of component mix  a hypothetical increase decrease in latex costs during fiscal would have resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in the cost of latex gloves of approximately million 
in addition  a hypothetical increase decrease in pvc and dop costs during fiscal would have resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in the cost of vinyl gloves of approximately million
