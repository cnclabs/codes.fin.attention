item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have no committed sources of capital and do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed on terms that are acceptable  if at all 
our current lack of resources is exacerbated by our inability to liquidate holdings of certain student loan auction rate securities 
the addition of this going concern statement from our independent registered public accounting firm may discourage some investors from purchasing our stock or providing alternative capital financing 
the failure to satisfy our capital requirements will adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
unless we raise additional funds  either through the sale of equity securities or one or more collaborative arrangements  we will need to halt the phase aspen study and significantly reduce our workforce and our operating expenses 
if we do not take these actions  we will not have sufficient funds to continue operations 
even if we take these actions  they may be insufficient  particulary if our costs are higher than projected or unforeseen expenses arise 
halting our phase aspen study or significantly reducing our workforce or operating expenses will adversely affect our business and prospects 
in order to complete our current phase aspen study  we will need to accrue a sufficient number of renal flares by enrolling a sufficient number of patients who meet the trial criteria 
if we are unable to successfully complete the trial  our business will be adversely affected and it may be difficult or impossible for us to continue to operate 
the current phase aspen study is an event driven trial requiring us to accrue a specified number of renal flares to complete the study 
we currently target enrolling at least patients to achieve the required number of renal flares 
we may need to enroll more patients in order to reach the required number of renal flares 
we may have difficulty enrolling patients because  among other matters  there are specific limitations on the medications that a patient may be taking upon entry into the trial and intense competition for available lupus patients 
if we are unable to accrue a sufficient number of renal flares or to timely enroll a sufficient number of patients  we will not be able to successfully complete the current phase aspen study 
as a result  it may be difficult or impossible for us to continue to operate 
results from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approvals to market riquent or our other drug candidates in the united states or other countries on a timely basis  if at all 
our drug candidates are subject to extensive government regulations related to development  clinical trials  manufacturing and commercialization 
in order to sell any product that is under development  we must first receive regulatory approval 
to obtain regulatory approval  we must conduct clinical trials and toxicology studies that demonstrate that our drug candidates are safe and effective 
the process of obtaining fda and foreign regulatory approvals is costly  time consuming  uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may not agree that we have demonstrated that riquent is safe and effective 
if riquent is ultimately not found to be safe and effective  we would be unable to obtain regulatory approval to manufacture  market and sell riquent 
although we have received an approvable letter from the fda  the analysis of the data from our previous phase trial of riquent showed that the trial did not reach statistical significance with respect to its primary endpoint  time to renal flare  or with respect to its secondary endpoint  time to treatment with high dose corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide 
in a preliminary assessment of the maa submitted in march  the emea reviewers indicated that additional clinical data would be needed prior to potential approval 
based on our review of the emea assessment  we believe that the current phase aspen study should provide the necessary data  however  since the data would not be available within the timeframe that the emea regulations allow for review of the riquent application we submitted  we withdrew the application 
we plan to refile the maa after the completion of the current phase aspen study  if it is successful 
we can provide no assurances that the fda or foreign regulatory authorities will ultimately approve riquent or  if approved  what the indication for riquent will be 

table of contents as designed  our current phase aspen study contains multiple dosing levels 
even if the phase aspen study is successful  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may require additional studies to define dosing recommendations before we can obtain approval to market riquent 
because substantially all of our resources are currently being devoted to riquent  our inability to obtain any regulatory approval of riquent as a result of the current phase aspen study would have a severe negative effect on our business  and  in the future  we may not have the financial resources to continue the development of riquent or any other potential drug candidates 
we are currently devoting nearly all of our resources to the development and approval of riquent 
accordingly  our efforts with respect to other drug candidates have significantly diminished 
future development of our small molecules for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and acute and chronic inflammatory disorders depends on our ability to obtain third party financing for this program through a joint venture  partnership or other collaborative arrangement 
as a result  progress with respect to drug candidates other than riquent  if any  will be significantly delayed and our success and ability to continue to operate depends on whether we obtain regulatory approval to market riquent 
current and future clinical trials may be delayed or halted 
current and future clinical trials of riquent  trials of drugs related to riquent  or clinical trials of other drug candidates may be delayed or halted 
for example  in  for a period of time we limited patient enrollment in our phase aspen trial in an effort to reduce costs 
in addition  our phase clinical trial of riquent was terminated before planned patient enrollment was completed 
current and future trials may be delayed or halted for various reasons  including we do not have sufficient financial resources  supplies of drug product are not sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  the products are not effective  patients experience negative side effects or other safety concerns are raised during treatment  the trials are not conducted in accordance with applicable clinical practices  or there is political unrest at foreign clinical sites  or there are natural disasters at any of our clinical sites 
if any current or future trials are delayed or halted  we may incur significant additional expenses  and our potential approval of riquent may be delayed  which could have a severe negative effect on our business 
we may be required to design and conduct additional trials for riquent 
we may be required to design and conduct additional studies to further demonstrate the safety and efficacy of riquent  either before or after a potential approval  which may result in significant expense and delay 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may require new or additional clinical trials because of inconclusive results from current or earlier clinical trials including the previous phase and phase trials of riquent  a possible failure to conduct clinical trials in complete adherence to fda good clinical practice standards and similar standards of foreign regulatory authorities  the identification of new clinical trial endpoints  or the need for additional data regarding safety or efficacy 
it is possible that the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately approve riquent or our other drug candidates for commercial sale in any jurisdiction  even if we believe future clinical results are positive 

table of contents we may experience shortages of riquent for use in our clinical studies 
we may experience shortages of riquent for use in our clinical studies 
we are implementing a commercial scale manufacturing process for riquent  but we have manufactured only a limited number of lots of riquent at this commercial scale 
in addition  the drug supply needed for our current phase aspen study may require us to manufacture significant quantities of riquent in a compressed time frame 
if we are unable to manufacture riquent in accordance with applicable fda good manufacturing practices at this commercial scale  or if we incur production delays our ability to timely complete clinical trials of riquent will be negatively affected 
if we encounter delays or difficulties in establishing or maintaining relationships with manufacturing or distribution contractors  our ability to timely complete necessary clinical trials and potentially deliver commercial products may be negatively affected 
we may enter into arrangements with contract manufacturing companies to expand our own production capacity in order to meet demand for our products or to attempt to improve manufacturing efficiency 
if we choose to contract for manufacturing services  the fda and comparable foreign regulators would have to approve the contract manufacturers prior to our use  and these contractors would be required to comply with strictly enforced manufacturing standards 
we may also enter into agreements with contractors to prepare and distribute our drug candidates for use by patients in clinical trials or commercially 
if we encounter delays or difficulties in establishing or maintaining relationships with contractors to produce  package or distribute our drug candidates  if they are unable to meet our needs  if they are not approved by the regulatory authorities  or if they fail to adhere to applicable manufacturing standards  our ability to timely complete necessary clinical trials and to introduce our products into the market would be negatively affected 
our limited manufacturing capabilities and experience could result in shortages of drugs for future sale  and our revenues and profit margin could be negatively affected 
we have never operated a commercial manufacturing facility and we will be required to manufacture riquent pursuant to applicable fda good manufacturing practices 
our inexperience could result in manufacturing delays or interruptions and higher manufacturing costs 
this could negatively affect our ability to supply the market on a timely and competitive basis 
the sales of our products  if any  and our profit margins may also be negatively affected 
in addition  substantial capital investment in the expansion and build out of our manufacturing facilities and or the engagement of third party contract manufacturers will be required to enable us to manufacture riquent  if approved  in sufficient commercial quantities 
we have limited manufacturing experience  and we may be unable to successfully transition to commercial production 
our suppliers may not be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of materials that we need to manufacture our products 
we rely on outside suppliers to provide us with specialized chemicals and reagents that we use to manufacture our drugs 
in order to manufacture riquent and our other drug candidates in sufficient quantities for our clinical trials and possible commercialization  our suppliers will be required to provide us with an adequate supply of chemicals and reagents 
our ability to obtain these chemicals and reagents is subject to the following risks our suppliers may not be able to increase their own manufacturing capabilities in order to provide us with a sufficient amount of material for our use  
table of contents some of our suppliers may be required to pass fda inspections or validations or to obtain other regulatory approvals of their manufacturing facilities or processes  and they may be delayed or unable to do so  the materials that our suppliers use to manufacture the chemicals and reagents that they provide us may be costly or in short supply  and there are a limited number of suppliers that are able to provide us with the chemicals or reagents that we use to manufacture our drugs 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of chemicals or reagents  our ability to produce products for clinical studies and  therefore  to introduce products into the market on a timely and competitive basis  will be impeded 
the subsequent sales of our products  if any  and our profit margins may also be negatively affected 
an interruption in the operation of our sole manufacturing facility could disrupt our operations 
we have only one drug manufacturing facility 
a significant interruption in the operation of this facility  whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes  could significantly impair our ability to manufacture drugs for our clinical trials or possible commercialization 
retaining our current personnel and recruiting additional personnel will be critical to our success 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our clinical development  manufacturing and management staff  the loss of whose services may delay the achievement of our research and development objectives 
retaining our current key personnel to perform clinical development  manufacturing  regulatory  and business development activities will be critical to our near term success 
we expect that recruiting additional qualified personnel to conduct clinical development  manufacturing  regulatory  and marketing and sales activities will be required to successfully further develop riquent and any additional drug candidates 
because competition for experienced clinical  manufacturing  regulatory  and marketing and sales personnel among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense  we may not be able to attract and retain these people 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified people  our ability to conduct necessary clinical trials  manufacture drug  comply with regulatory requirements  enter into collaborative agreements and develop and sell potential products may be negatively affected because  for instance  the trials may not be conducted properly  or the manufacturing or sales of our products may be delayed 
in addition  we rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our clinical  manufacturing  regulatory  business development  and marketing and sales strategies 
all of our consultants and advisors have outside employment and may have commitments or consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their ability to contribute to our business 
we will need additional funds to support our operations 
our operations to date have consumed substantial capital resources 
before we can obtain fda or foreign regulatory approval for riquent  we will need to successfully complete the current phase aspen study and possibly additional trials 
therefore  we expect to expend substantial amounts of capital resources for additional product development and clinical trials of riquent 
we may also devote substantial additional capital resources to establish commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell potential products 
these expenses may be incurred prior to or after any regulatory approvals that we may receive 
even with the net proceeds of approximately million from our common stock offering in april  we will need additional funds to finance our future operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and results of our clinical trials  
table of contents our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of drug to support clinical trials  our ability to obtain regulatory approval for riquent  the time and costs involved in applying for regulatory approvals  continued scientific progress in our development programs  the size and complexity of our development programs  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative research and development arrangements  our need to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities  and our ability to develop effective marketing and sales programs 
we expect to incur substantial losses each year for at least the next several years as we continue our planned clinical trial  manufacturing  regulatory  and development activities 
if we receive regulatory approval for riquent  or any of our other drug candidates  our manufacturing  marketing and sales activities are likely to substantially increase our expenses and our need for additional working capital 
in the future  it is possible that we will not be able to obtain additional funds and thus not have adequate resources to support continuation of our business activities 
our freedom to operate our business or profit fully from sales of our products may be limited if we enter into collaborative agreements 
we may need to collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies to gain access to their financial  research  drug development  manufacturing  or marketing and sales resources 
however  we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with any collaborative partners on favorable terms  if at all 
any collaborative relationships that we enter into may include restrictions on our freedom to operate our business or may limit our revenues from potential products 
if a collaborative arrangement is established  the collaborative partner may discontinue funding any particular program or may  either alone or with others  pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative drug candidates for the diseases we are targeting 
competing products  developed by a collaborative partner or to which a collaborative partner has rights  may result in the collaborative partner withdrawing support as to all or a portion of our technology 
without collaborative arrangements  we must fund our own clinical development  manufacturing  and marketing and sales activities  which accelerates the depletion of our cash and requires us to develop our own manufacturing and marketing and sales capabilities 
therefore  if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements and if other sources of cash are not available  we will experience a severe adverse effect on our ability to develop products and  if developed and approved  to manufacture  market and sell them successfully 
any regulatory approvals that we may obtain for our product candidates may be limited and subsequent issues regarding safety or efficacy could cause us to remove products from the market 
if the fda or foreign regulatory authorities grant approval of riquent or any of our other drug candidates  the approval may be limited to specific conditions or patient populations  or limited with respect to its distribution  including to specified facilities or physicians with special training or experience 
the imposition of any of these restrictions or other restrictions on the marketing and use of riquent could adversely affect any future sales of riquent 
furthermore  even if a drug candidate is approved  it is possible that a subsequent issue regarding its safety or efficacy would require us to remove the drug from the market 

table of contents even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and review  including validation of our manufacturing facilities and processes 
following any regulatory approval of our product candidates  we will be subject to continuing regulatory obligations such as safety reporting requirements and additional post marketing obligations  including regulatory oversight of the promotion and marketing of our products 
in addition  we  and any third party manufacturers  will be required to adhere to regulations setting forth cgmps 
these regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing  testing  quality control and record keeping relating to our product candidates 
furthermore  we  and any third party manufacturers  will be subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
these inspections may result in compliance issues that would require the expenditure of significant financial or other resources to address 
if we  or any third party manufacturers that we may engage  fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
although a successful pre approval inspection was conducted by the fda in july  we have never operated a commercial manufacturing facility 
if we are unable to maintain validated conditions at our manufacturing facilities or fail to successfully validate our manufacturing processes to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities  they will not approve riquent for commercial use 
the size of the market for our potential products is uncertain 
we estimate that the number of people who suffer from lupus in the united states and europe is potentially more than  and those with renal impairment  which riquent is designed to treat  is approximately  however  there is limited and differing information available regarding the actual size of these patient populations 
in addition  it is uncertain whether the results from previous or future clinical trials of riquent will be observed in broader patient populations  and the number of patients who may benefit from riquent may be significantly smaller than the estimated patient populations 
furthermore  management of patients with renal disease by specialists other than nephrologists and rheumatologists is likely to reduce our ability to access patients who may benefit from riquent 
our drugs may not achieve market acceptance 
even if riquent or our other drug candidates receive regulatory approval  patients and physicians may not readily or quickly accept our proposed methods of treatment 
in order for riquent or our other drug candidates to be commercially successful  we will need to increase the awareness and acceptance of our drug candidates among physicians  patients and the medical community 
riquent is designed to be administered weekly by intravenous injection 
it is possible that providers and patients may resist an intravenously administered therapeutic 
it is also possible that physician treatment practices may change and that the use of other drugs  either newly approved or currently on the market for other conditions  may become widely utilized by clinicians for the treatment of patients with lupus and reduce the potential use of riquent in this patient population 
in addition  if we are unable to manufacture drugs at an acceptable cost  physicians may not readily prescribe drugs that we may manufacture due to cost benefit considerations when compared to other methods of treatment 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance for approved products  our revenues and potential for profitability will be negatively affected 
we lack experience in marketing products for commercial sale 
in order to commercialize any drug candidate approved by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities  we must either develop marketing and sales programs or enter into marketing arrangements with others 
if we cannot do either of these successfully  we will not generate meaningful sales of any products that may be approved 
if we develop our own marketing and sales capabilities  we will be required to employ a sales force  
table of contents establish and staff a customer service department  and create or identify distribution channels for our drugs 
we will compete with other companies that have experienced and well funded marketing and sales operations 
in addition  if we establish our own sales and distribution capabilities  we will incur material expenses and may experience delays or have difficulty in gaining market acceptance for our drug candidates 
we currently have no marketing arrangements with others 
there can be no guarantee that  if we desire to  we will be able to enter into any marketing agreements on favorable terms  if at all  or that any such agreements will result in payments to us 
if we enter into co promotion or other marketing and sales arrangements with other companies  any revenues that we may receive will be dependent on the efforts of others 
there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful 
we may not earn as much revenue as we hope due to possible changes in healthcare reimbursement policies 
the continuing efforts of government and healthcare insurance companies to reduce the costs of healthcare may reduce the amount of revenue that we can generate from sales of future products  if any 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription drugs are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put pressure on drug manufacturers to reduce prices 
price control initiatives could reduce the revenue that we receive for any products we may develop and sell in the future 
moreover  even if riquent were approved we cannot predict what the dosage requirements or degree of efficacy would be and therefore whether or not healthcare reimbursement policies would enable a sales price that allows us to be profitable 
we have a history of losses and may not become profitable 
we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception in and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we expect to incur substantial losses each year for at least the next several years as we conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates  seek regulatory approval and continue our clinical development  manufacturing  and regulatory activities 
in addition  assuming we ultimately receive approval from the fda or foreign regulatory authorities for riquent or our other drug candidates  we will be required to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities and marketing and sales programs which may result in substantial additional losses 
to achieve profitability we must  among other matters  complete the development of our products  obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and establish commercial manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
the amount of losses and the time required by us to reach sustained profitability are highly uncertain and we may never achieve profitability 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of riquent  if approved  or our other products  if any  in the near term  and we may never generate product revenues 
our success in developing and marketing our drug candidates depends significantly on our ability to obtain patent protection for riquent and any other developed products 
in addition  we will need to successfully preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
we depend on patents and other unpatented intellectual property to prevent others from improperly benefiting from products or technologies that we may have developed 
we currently own issued patents and have pending patent applications in the united states and in foreign countries 
these patents and patent applications cover various technologies and drug candidates  including riquent 
there can be no assurance  however  that any additional patents will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will be sufficient to protect us or our technology  or that any current or future issued patent will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
we are currently involved in an opposition proceeding in europe challenging the validity of certain claims in our european patent relating to our antibody mediated thrombosis drug technology 
there is a substantial backlog of biotechnology patent applications at the united states patent and trademark office that may delay the review and issuance of any patents 
the patent position of biotechnology firms like ours is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions  and no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims covered in biotechnology patents or the protection afforded by these patents 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as believed appropriate for patents covering both our products and processes 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of these applications  or that the scope of any issued patents will protect our technology 

table of contents we do not necessarily know if others  including competitors  have patents or patent applications pending that relate to compounds or processes that overlap or compete with our intellectual property or which may affect our freedom to operate 
we are aware of certain families of patents and patent applications that contain claims covering subject matter that may affect our ability to develop  manufacture and sell our products in the future 
we have conducted investigations into these patent families to determine what impact  if any  the patent families could have on our continued development  manufacture and  if approved by the fda  sale of our drug candidates  including riquent 
based on our investigations to date  we currently do not believe that these patent families are likely to impede the advancement of our drug candidates  including riquent 
however  there can be no assurance that upon our further investigation  these patent families or other patents will not ultimately be found to impact the advancement of our drug candidates  including riquent 
if the united states patent and trademark office or any foreign counterpart issues or has issued patents containing competitive or conflicting claims  and if these claims are valid  the protection provided by our existing patents or any future patents that may be issued could be significantly reduced  and our ability to prevent competitors from developing products or technologies identical or similar to ours could be negatively affected 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that we would be able to develop or obtain alternative technology 
our failure to obtain a license to a technology or process that may be required to develop or commercialize one or more of our drug candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we may have to incur significant expenses and management time in defending or enforcing our patents 
we also rely on unpatented intellectual property such as trade secrets and improvements  know how  and continuing technological innovation 
while we seek to protect these rights  it is possible that others  including competitors  will develop inventions relevant to our business  our confidentiality agreements will be breached  and we may not have  or be successful in obtaining  adequate remedies for such a breach  or our trade secrets will otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
we could incur substantial costs and devote substantial management time in defending suits that others might bring against us for infringement of intellectual property rights or in prosecuting suits that we might bring against others to protect our intellectual property rights 
the technology underlying our products is uncertain and unproven 
all of our product development efforts are based on unproven technologies and therapeutic approaches that have not been widely tested or used 
to date  no pharmaceutical products that use our technology have been commercialized 
the fda has not determined that we have proven riquent to be safe and effective in humans  and the technology on which it is based has been used only in our pre clinical tests and clinical trials 
clinical trials of riquent may be viewed as a test of our entire approach to developing therapies for antibody mediated diseases 
if riquent does not work as intended  or if the data from our clinical trials indicates that riquent is not safe and effective  the applicability of our technology for successfully treating antibody mediated diseases will be highly uncertain 
as a result  there is a significant risk that our therapeutic approaches will not prove to be successful  and there can be no guarantee that our drug discovery technologies will result in any commercially successful products 

table of contents because a number of companies compete with us  many of which have greater resources than we do  and because we face rapid changes in technology in our industry  we cannot be certain that our products will be accepted in the marketplace or capture market share 
competition from domestic and foreign biotechnology companies  large pharmaceutical companies and other institutions is intense and is expected to increase 
a number of companies and institutions are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals in our targeted areas 
many of these companies are very large  and have financial  technical  sales and distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours 
the greater resources of these competitors could enable them to develop competing products more quickly than we are able to  and to market any competing product more quickly or effectively so as to make it extremely difficult for us to develop a share of the market for our products 
these competitors also include companies that are conducting clinical trials and pre clinical studies for the treatment of lupus 
our competitors may develop or obtain regulatory approval for products more rapidly than we do 
if the fda were to approve a drug that is significantly similar in structure to riquent for the same indication that riquent is designed to treat  and such drug received marketing exclusivity under the orphan drug act  the fda may be prevented from approving riquent 
also  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid changes in technology 
our competitors may develop and market technologies and products that are more effective or less costly than those we are developing  or that would render our technology and proposed products obsolete or noncompetitive 
we may not be able to take advantage of the orphan drug designation for riquent 
in september  the fda granted us orphan drug designation for riquent for the treatment of lupus nephritis 
the orphan drug act potentially enables us to obtain research funding and tax credits for certain research expenses 
in addition  the orphan drug act allows for seven years of exclusive marketing rights to a specific drug for a specific orphan indication 
exclusivity is conferred upon receipt of marketing approval from the fda to the first sponsor who obtains such approval for a designated drug 
the marketing exclusivity prevents fda approval during the seven year period of the same drug  as defined in the fda regulations  from another company for the same orphan indication 
whether we will be able to take advantage of some of the benefits afforded by the orphan drug designation will ultimately be determined by the fda only after further review of our nda 
the use of riquent or other potential products in clinical trials  as well as the sale of any approved products  may expose us to lawsuits resulting from the use of these products 
the use and possible sale of riquent or other potential products may expose us to legal liability and negative publicity if we are subject to claims that our products harmed people 
these claims might be made directly by patients  pharmaceutical companies  or others 
we currently maintain million of product liability insurance for claims arising from the use of our products in clinical trials 
however  product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive 
in addition  in the event of any commercialization of any of our products  we will likely need to obtain additional insurance  which will increase our insurance expenses 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain insurance or that insurance can be acquired at a reasonable cost  in sufficient amounts  or with broad enough coverage to protect us against possible losses 
furthermore  it is possible that our financial resources would be insufficient to satisfy potential product liability or other claims 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could negatively impact our business and financial condition 
we face environmental liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations 
due to the nature of our manufacturing processes  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws governing the use  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations if and when our manufacturing increases to commercial volumes 
current or future environmental laws may significantly affect our operations because  for instance  our production process may be required to be altered  thereby increasing our production costs 
in our research and 
table of contents manufacturing activities  we use radioactive and other materials that could be hazardous to human health  safety or the environment 
these materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our facility pending ultimate use and disposal 
the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
although we maintain general liability insurance  we do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities 
ii 
risk factors related specifically to our stock 
the ownership of our common stock is concentrated 
as of february   our three largest stockholders beneficially owned approximately of our currently outstanding shares of common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
for example  the sale by any of our large stockholders of a significant portion of that stockholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  two of these stockholders have the ability  either alone or jointly  to appoint four members of our board of directors 
accordingly  these two stockholders  either directly or indirectly  have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
our common stock price is volatile and may decline even if our business is doing well 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including ours  have historically been highly volatile  and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors  among others  can have a significant effect on the market price of our securities limited financial resources  our clinical trial results  future sales of significant amounts of our common stock by us or our stockholders  actions or decisions by the fda and other comparable agencies  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of drugs discovered or developed by us or others  developments concerning potential agreements with collaborators  comments by securities analysts and general market conditions  and government regulation  including any legislation that may impact the price of any commercial products that we may seek to sell 
the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 

table of contents future sales of our stock by our stockholders could negatively affect the market price of our stock 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could result in a drop in the market price of our securities 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of common stock that have been issued in registered offerings or were otherwise freely tradable in the public markets 
approximately  shares of common stock eligible for resale in the public market pursuant to sec rule  shares of common stock underlying warrants which have been registered for resale under a registration statement on form s  shares of common stock that may be issued on the exercise of outstanding stock options granted under our various stock option plans at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
approximately  shares of common stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to awards granted under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans  which shares are covered by effective registration statements under the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
pursuant to a registration statement on form s filed on december   we registered an aggregate amount of  of our common stock for issuance from time to time 
as of february   there was  of our common stock available for future issuance under this registration statement  which expires on december  pursuant to a registration statement on form s filed on august   we registered an aggregate amount of  of our common stock for issuance from time to time 
as of february   no shares of common stock had been issued under this registration statement  which expires on august  we cannot estimate the number of shares of common stock that may actually be resold in the public market because this will depend on the market price for our common stock  the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors 
we also have a number of stockholders that own significant blocks of our common stock 
if these stockholders sell significant portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the market price of our common stock could drop significantly 
our stock may be removed from listing on the nasdaq global market and may not qualify for listing on any stock exchange  in which case it may be difficult to maintain a market in our stock 
in  we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market that our stock price fell below the required minimum bid price 
we have since regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule  but we are required to maintain compliance in order to maintain our listing 
in addition to the minimum bid price rule  the nasdaq global market has several other continued listing requirements 
failure to maintain compliance with any nasdaq listing requirement could cause our stock to be removed from listing on nasdaq 
if this were to happen  we may not be able to secure listing on other exchanges or quotation systems 
if our stock is no longer traded on an exchange or quotation system  it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell the shares that they own 
this would have a negative effect on the price and liquidity of our stock 

table of contents failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year beginning in and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all future annual reports beginning with the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to report on our internal control over financial reporting 
we evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in order to comply with section and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to conclude in the future that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section if we fail to achieve and maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
anti takeover devices may prevent changes in our board of directors and management 
we have in place several anti takeover devices  including a stockholder rights plan  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our management or deterring third parties from seeking to acquire significant positions in our common stock 
for example  one anti takeover device provides for a board of directors that is separated into three classes  with their terms in office staggered over three year periods 
this has the effect of delaying a change in control of our board of directors without the cooperation of the incumbent board 
in addition  our bylaws require stockholders to give us written notice of any proposal or director nomination within a specified period of time prior to the annual stockholder meeting  establish certain qualifications for a person to be elected or appointed to the board of directors during the pendency of certain business combination transactions  and do not allow stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders 
we may also issue shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval and upon terms that our board of directors may determine in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock  and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations 
our discussion is organized as follows recent developments 
this section provides a general description of recent events and significant transactions that we believe are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
overview 
this section provides a general description of our business and operating history 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies and estimates  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  and comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments  both firm and contingent  that existed as of december  included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements 
recent developments on february   we announced that we had made significant progress in our current phase aspen study in that we had enrolled patients and clinical trial sites were open to enroll patients in countries 
in addition  we also announced that our current enrollment target of at least patients was expected to be completed around the end of the second quarter of on february   we announced that we had made continued progress in enrolling patients in our phase aspen study in that we had enrolled patients in the study and clinical trial sites were open to enroll patients  including newly added sites in europe and mexico 
in addition  we also announced that following discussions with the fda  we implemented several enhancements to further strengthen the phase aspen study  which remains under special protocol assessment 
these enhancements included a focus on higher doses and increase in sample size 
on march and march   we announced positive interim antibody results from our current phase aspen study 
analyses of interim antibody data indicated that patients treated with mg or mg per week doses of riquent had greater reductions in antibodies to dsdna than patients treated with mg per week or placebo 
the results showed a significant dose response when comparing all riquent treated patients to placebo treated patients p  and each riquent dose group to the placebo dose group p for mg  p for mg and mg 

table of contents on march   we announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
in connection with this offering  we granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional  shares to cover over allotments 
on april   we announced that we had completed the public offering for total net proceeds of approximately million  including the proceeds from the over allotment shares 
on april   we announced that composition of matter patents covering riquent have issued in both europe and in the people s republic of china 
if the full five years of patent term extension under a supplemental protection certificate is granted  the term of the european patent would extend to december  the chinese patent will be in effect until september  on may   we announced that niv e 
caviar had joined the company as executive vice president  chief business officer and chief financial officer 
on may   we announced that we had presented three papers related to riquent at the th international congress on sle 
the first presentation reviewed recently announced safety and interim antibody data from the current phase aspen study which highlighted the statistically significant dose response observed between the mg  mg and mg doses of riquent compared with placebo p 
the second presentation reviewed the safety and drug levels of riquent at doses up to  mg in healthy volunteers and the third  cardiovascular safety in healthy volunteers 
overview since our inception in may  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of technology and potential drugs to treat antibody mediated diseases 
we have never generated any revenue from product sales and have relied on public and private offerings of securities  revenue from collaborative agreements  equipment financings and interest income on invested cash balances for our working capital 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in the future 
for example  we are conducting and expanding a phase clinical trial of riquent which the fda has indicated appears to satisfy the requirement that we conduct an additional randomized  double blind study 
this study is an event drive trial requiring us to accrue a specified number of renal flares to complete the study 
we currently target enrolling at least patients to achieve the required number of renal flares and the trial could take several years to complete 
therefore  we expect to expend substantial amounts of capital resources for the clinical development and manufacturing of riquent 
we may also devote substantial additional capital resources to establish commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell potential products 
these expenses may be incurred prior to or after any regulatory approvals that we may receive 
in addition  our research and development expenses may increase if we initiate any additional clinical studies of riquent or if we increase our activities related to any additional drug candidates 
we will need additional funds to finance our future operations 
our activities to date are not as broad in depth or scope as the activities we may undertake in the future  and our historical operations and the financial information included in this report are not necessarily indicative of our future operating results or financial condition 
we expect our net loss to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of expenses incurred and the revenues earned from any potential collaborative arrangements that we may establish 
some of these fluctuations may be significant 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 

table of contents our business is subject to significant risks  including  but not limited to  the need for additional financing or a collaborative partner to continue our clinical activities and continue to operate  the risks inherent in research and development efforts  including clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated with both obtaining and enforcing patents  the potential enforcement of the patent rights of others against us  uncertainties regarding government reforms regarding product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties  our lack of marketing experience  the uncertainty of receiving future revenue from product sales or other sources such as collaborative relationships  and the uncertainty of future profitability 
even if our product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons  including the possibilities that the products will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of third parties or competing products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to patent costs and clinical regulatory expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see also note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we regularly review our long lived assets for impairment 
our long lived assets include costs incurred to file our patent applications 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
the estimation of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual results 
while we believe our current and historical operating and cash flow losses are indicators of impairment  we believe the future cash flows to be received from the long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
there were no impairment losses recognized for the year ended december  we have recognized approximately million in impairment losses for each of the years ended december  and december  costs related to successful patent applications are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the remaining useful life of the related technology or the remaining patent life  commencing on the date the patent is issued 
legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with pending patent applications have been capitalized 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of abandonment 
the estimation of useful lives for long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual results 
in addition  our results of operations could be materially impacted if we begin amortizing the costs related to unissued patents 

table of contents accrued clinical regulatory expenses we review and accrue clinical trial and regulatory related expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment  sites activated and other events 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a clinical trial can be made 
accrued clinical regulatory costs are subject to revisions as trials progress to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development costs  however a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated statement of operations as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated statements of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based payment awards granted under all equity compensation plans 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we currently expect to recognize the remaining unrecognized compensation cost over a weighted average period of years 
additional share based compensation expense for any new share based payment awards granted after december  under all equity compensation plans cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other matters  the amounts of share based payment awards granted in the future 
prior to january   we had adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure of stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  we had not previously recognized compensation expense  except for compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants and restricted stock granted to certain members of management 
had we recognized compensation expense in accordance with sfas for the year ended december   our net loss would have increased by approximately million or per basic and diluted share 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because the employee and director stock options granted by us have characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in our opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the employee and director stock options granted by us 
although the fair value of the employee and director stock options granted by us is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents on january   we adopted fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the impact of fin to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june  fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities etf 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended december   and research and development expense 
our research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses in from resulted primarily from an increase in riquent related drug production and clinical trial expenses of approximately million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in expenses in as compared to for the development of our ssao program  as all of our resources are being devoted to the development of riquent and further development of the ssao program depends on our ability to enter into a joint venture  partnership or other collaborative arrangement for this program 
research and development expense of million for the year ended december  consisted of million for lupus research and development related expense and million for ssao research and development related expense 
total lupus research and development expense consisted primarily of riquent related clinical trial expenses and clinical drug supply  salaries and other costs related to manufacturing  clinical and research personnel and fees for consulting and professional outside services 
total ssao research and development expense consisted primarily of salaries and other costs related to research and development personnel  and depreciation expense 
our research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses in from resulted primarily from an increase in riquent related drug production and clinical trial expenses of approximately million 
in addition  the increase was due to share based compensation expense recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas r of approximately million and an increase in riquent related consulting expenses of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in termination benefits  mainly relating to severance  of approximately million that was recorded in in connection with the termination of research and development personnel  and the savings in salaries and related expenses as a result of this reduction in personnel 

table of contents we expect that our research and development expense will increase significantly in the future 
for example  we are conducting and expanding a clinical trial of riquent that the fda has indicated appears to satisfy the requirement that we conduct an additional randomized  double blind study 
the study is currently targeted to enroll at least patients and could take several years to complete 
as patient enrollment expands in our phase aspen study  our expenses for the manufacturing of riquent will also increase 
additionally  our research and development expenses may increase significantly if we initiate any additional clinical studies of riquent or if we increase our activities related to the development of additional drug candidates 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease in general and administrative expense in from resulted primarily from a decrease in termination benefits  which for were mainly severance of approximately million and compensation expense of approximately million for accelerated stock option vesting related to the former chairman and chief executive officer s departure in the first quarter of this decrease was partially offset by the increase in the write off of selected patent applications for technologies not related to riquent or our small molecule ssao inhibitors program of approximately million  an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million for stock options granted in and and an increase in consulting expenses for business development and market research of approximately million 
our general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in general and administrative expense in from resulted primarily from share based compensation expense recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas r of approximately million 
the increase was also due to the expense recorded in the first quarter of for severance paid to the former chairman and chief executive officer of approximately million and an increase in general corporate consulting and professional outside services of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in termination benefits  mainly relating to severance  of approximately million that was recorded in in connection with the termination of general and administrative personnel  and the savings in salaries and related expenses as a result of this reduction in personnel 
general and administrative expense will increase in the future to support our ongoing clinical trials as patient enrollment and the manufacturing of riquent increases 
additionally  general and administrative expense may increase in the future if there is an increase in research and development or commercialization activities 
interest income and expense 
our interest income was comparable for the years ended december  and december  our interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for due to higher average balances of cash and short term investments and higher average interest rates on our investments as compared to interest expense was comparable for the years ended december   and net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards 
at december   we had federal and california income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the difference between the federal and california tax loss carryforwards is primarily attributable to the capitalization of research and development expenses for california income tax purposes 
in addition  we had federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
the california net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
the california research and development credit carryforwards will carry forward indefinitely until utilized 

table of contents we are currently undergoing a section analysis regarding the limitation of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards 
until this analysis has been completed we have removed the deferred tax assets for net operating losses of million and research and development credits of million generated through from our deferred tax asset schedule and have recorded a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance 
when this analysis is finalized  we plan to update unrecognized tax benefits under fin no 
we expect the section analysis to be completed within the next twelve months 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million and have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities  revenues from collaborative agreements  equipment financings and interest income on invested cash balances 
from inception through december   we had raised approximately million in net proceeds from sales of equity securities 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as compared to million as of december  our working capital as of december  was million  as compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted from the use of our financial resources to fund our clinical trial and manufacturing activities  research and development efforts  and for other general corporate purposes  offset by the net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of our common stock in april we invest our cash primarily in aaa rated government asset backed securities  obligations of government agencies  and money market funds 
as of december   all of our investments are classified as available for sale securities because we expect to sell them in order to support our current operations regardless of their maturity dates 
as of december   available for sale securities and cash equivalents of million have stated maturity dates of one year or less and million have maturity dates after one year 
securities that have a maturity date greater than one year have their interest rate reset periodically within time periods not exceeding days 
subsequent to december   we sold million of our asset backed auction rate securities at par value 
as of march   there was insufficient demand at auction for three of our aaa rated us government backed student loan auction rate securities  representing approximately million of the remaining million we currently hold in asset backed auction rate securities 
as a result of the insufficient demand  these three securities are currently not liquid and unless a future auction which occurs approximately every days for these investments is successful  we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the issuer or to maturity  which ranges between years 
we may experience a similar situation with our other remaining asset backed student loan auction rate security of million  which comes up for auction on march  in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  until a future auction on these investments is successful  the securities are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
at this time  management has not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that these investments are impaired or that they will not be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   approximately million of equipment million net of depreciation is financed under notes payable and capital lease obligations 
in december  we entered into a credit facility to fund equipment purchases up to million until the end of the second quarter of in addition  we lease our office and laboratory facilities and certain equipment under operating leases 
we have also entered into non cancelable purchase commitments for an aggregate of million with third party manufacturers of materials to be used in the production of riquent 
we intend to use our current financial resources to fund our obligations under these purchase commitments 
in the future  we may increase our investments in property and equipment if we expand our manufacturing and development facilities and capabilities 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  long term debt and capital lease obligations include interest 
payment due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total we intend to use our financial resources to fund the current clinical studies of riquent  possible future clinical trials  manufacturing activities  research and development efforts and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the amounts that we actually spend for each purpose may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the results from current and future clinical trials  the continued analysis of the clinical trial data of riquent  the outcome of our meetings with regulatory authorities  the timing of any regulatory applications and approvals  and technological developments 
expenditures also will depend on any establishment of collaborative arrangements and contract research as well as the availability of other funding or financings 
we will continue to seek capital through any number of means  including by issuing our equity securities and by establishing one or more collaborative arrangements 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as we continue to use existing resources or if the development of riquent is delayed or terminated 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships 
in the future  it is possible that we will not have adequate resources to support continuation of our business activities 
we have no current means of generating cash flow from operations 
our lead drug candidate  riquent  will not generate revenues  if at all  until it has received regulatory approval and has been successfully manufactured  marketed and sold 
this process  if completed  will take a significant amount of time 
our other drug candidates are much less developed than riquent 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts with respect to riquent or any other drug candidate will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that any product  if introduced  will be successfully marketed or achieve commercial acceptance 
accordingly  we must continue to rely on outside sources of financing to meet our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition  changes in our consolidated financial condition  expenses  consolidated results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in interest bearing investment grade securities which we sell from time to time to support our current operations 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
we currently do not invest in any securities that are materially and directly affected by foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and are therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
our investment securities consist primarily of government asset backed securities  obligations of government agencies  and money market funds 
as of december   our short term investments included million of aaa rated student loan auction rate securities issued primarily by state governments 
subsequent to december   we sold million of these asset backed auction rate securities at par value 
our auction rate securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the recent conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to the security s maximum rate 
when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or mature  which could be many years 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment would be required to be adjusted through an impairment charge 
as of march   there was insufficient demand at auctions for three of our aaa rated us government backed student loan auction rate securities  representing approximately million of our remaining million auction rate securities then outstanding 
as a result of this insufficient demand  these three securities may not be liquid and the interest rates have been reset to the security s maximum rate 
we may experience a similar situation with our other remaining asset backed student loan auction rate security of million  which comes up for auction on march  to date  we have not recognized any realized losses on these securities 
see note to our consolidated financial statement for further information 
in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer 
at this time  management has not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that these investments are impaired or that they will not be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  this could potentially impact our current business plan as we will need the ability to access these funds in the near future 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately million
