item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  estimates and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in this report under risk factors 
overview we design  manufacture and sell high performance memory subsystems for the server  high performance computing and communications markets 
our memory subsystems consist of dynamic random access memory integrated circuits  or dram ics  nand and other components assembled on a printed circuit board  or pcb 
we engage with our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers from the earliest stages of new product definition  which provides us unique insight into their full range of system architecture and performance requirements 
this close collaboration has also allowed us to develop a significant level of systems expertise 
we leverage a portfolio of proprietary technologies and design techniques  including efficient planar design  alternative packaging techniques and custom semiconductor logic  to deliver memory subsystems with high memory density  small form factor  high signal integrity  attractive thermal characteristics and low cost per bit 
due to their importance to overall system architecture and performance  our products must undergo lengthy qualification reviews by our oem customers  which may last up to six months 
in addition  in order to penetrate large oems  we have typically been required to demonstrate our ability to meet strict standards for quality  customer service and turnaround time by first supplying less complex products into a limited range of high volume applications 
for example  the initial products we sold to ibm were used in mobile computing applications 
the majority of our sales of subsequent products to ibm have been for high end server applications  our primary market focus 
consistent with the concentrated nature of the oem customer base in our target markets  a small number of large customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
dell  hewlett packard and ibm represented approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales in fiscal  and approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales in fiscal net sales to some of our oem customers include memory modules that are qualified by us directly with the oem customer and sold to electronic manufacturing services providers  or emss  for incorporation into products manufactured exclusively for the oem customer 
these net sales to emss have historically fluctuated period by period as a portion of the total net sales to these oem customers 
net sales to hon hai precision industry co 
ltd  an ems that purchases memory modules from us for incorporation into products manufactured exclusively for dell  represented approximately of net sales to dell for fiscal and approximately of net sales to dell for fiscal net sales to kingston technology company  inc  and to international systems technology co 
ltd  both emss that purchase memory modules from us for incorporation into products manufactured exclusively for ibm  represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales to ibm for fiscal and approximately and  respectively  of net sales to ibm for fiscal for the year ended december   the market price for mainstream dram ics decreased by approximately 
this decline has adversely affected the selling prices of many of our products and generally contributed to lower revenues  lower gross margin and reduced inventory value during this period 
should the decline in the dram ic market continue  it would result in lower net sales  lower gross margin and reduced inventory value in subsequent periods 
key business metrics the following describes certain line items in our statements of operations that are important to management s assessment of our financial performance net sales 
net sales consist primarily of sales of our high performance memory subsystems  net of a provision for estimated returns under our right of return policies  which generally range up to days 
we generally do not have long term sales agreements with our customers 
although oem customers typically provide us with non binding forecasts of future product demand over specific periods of time  they generally place orders with us approximately two weeks in advance of scheduled delivery 
selling prices are typically negotiated monthly  based on competitive market conditions and the current price of dram ics 
purchase orders generally have no cancellation or rescheduling penalty provisions 
we often ship our products to our customers international manufacturing sites 
all of our sales to date  however  are denominated in us dollars 
we also sell excess component inventory of dram ics to distributors and other users of memory ics 
these sales accounted for approximately and of our net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
we expect that component inventory sales will continue to decrease as a percentage of net sales in future periods as we diversify our customer base and therefore are able to use components in a wider range of memory subsystems 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of materials  manufacturing costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment  inventory valuation provisions  stock based compensation and occupancy costs and other allocated fixed costs 
the dram ics and nand incorporated into our products constitute a significant portion of our cost of sales  and thus our cost of sales will fluctuate based on the current price of dram ics and nand 
we attempt to pass through such dram ic and nand cost fluctuations to our customers by frequently renegotiating pricing prior to the placement of their purchase orders 
to the extent we are successful  a large majority of our product cost is variable  and thus our cost of sales and gross margin percentages may not be significantly impacted by changes in sales volume 
however  the sales prices of our memory subsystems can also fluctuate due to competitive situations unrelated to the pricing of dram ics and nand  which will affect gross margins 
the gross margin on our sales of excess component dram ic and nand inventory is much lower than the gross margin on our sales of our memory subsystems 
as a result  a decrease in dram ic and nand inventory sales as a percentage of our overall sales would result in an improved overall gross margin 
we assess the valuation of our inventories on a monthly basis and record a provision to cost of sales as necessary to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee and independent contractor compensation and related costs  stock based compensation  computer aided design software licenses  reference design development costs  patent related fees  depreciation or rental of evaluation equipment  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
also included in research and development expense are the costs of material and overhead related to the production of engineering samples of new products under development or products used solely in the research and development process 
our customers typically do not separately compensate us for design and engineering work involved in developing application specific products for them 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
to the extent that we continue efforts to develop additional proprietary technologies  we anticipate that research and development expenditures will increase 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related costs  stock based compensation  independent sales representative commissions  professional services  promotional and other selling and marketing expenses  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
a significant portion of our selling efforts is directed at building relationships with oems and working through the product approval and qualification process with them 
therefore  the cost of material and overhead related to products manufactured for qualification is included in selling expenses 
as we continue to service existing and penetrate new oem customers  we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase 
we also anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of net sales as we incur various accounting  legal and other professional expenses associated with our ongoing public company reporting obligations and compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of provision benefit for income taxes 
our income tax provision benefit is based on the statutory federal tax rate of and is typically impacted by state taxes and permanent book tax differences 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may result in material adverse effects on our operating results and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
under the provisions of sab no 
 we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  product delivery and acceptance have occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders and or contracts as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped for customers with fob shipping point terms and upon receipt for customers with fob destination terms  at which time title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery and customer acceptance 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund 
customers are generally allowed limited rights of return for up to days  except for sales of excess inventories  which contain no right of return privileges 
estimated returns are provided for at the time of sale based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
we offer a standard product warranty to our customers and have no other post shipment obligations 
while these returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience similar return rates in the future 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting product returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and evaluations  as well as the customer s payment history 
most of our international shipments are made to third party inventory warehouses  or hubs  and we recognize revenue when the inventory is pulled from the hub for use in production by the customer 
we receive a report from the customer on a daily basis indicating the inventories pulled from a hub for use by the customer  and perform a daily reconciliation of inventories shipped to and pulled by the customer to those inventories reflected on the customer s reports to ensure that sales are recognized in the appropriate periods 
we have historically had good visibility into our customers requirements within each reporting period 
however  if a customer does not pull our inventory from its hub in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our predicted future revenues could vary from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  since we own inventories that are physically located in hubs  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our inventory turns to decrease  which would increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventories and negatively impact our cash flow 
all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as net sales  while all costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as cost of sales 
warranty reserve 
we offer warranties on our memory subsystems generally ranging from one to three years  depending on the product and negotiated terms of purchase agreements with our customers 
such warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
our estimates for warranty related costs are recorded at the time of sale based on historical and estimated future product return rates and expected repair or replacement costs 
while such costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  unexpected changes in failure rates could have a material adverse impact on us  requiring additional warranty reserves  and adversely affecting our gross profit and gross margins 
accounts receivable 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended to our customers as deemed necessary  but generally require no collateral 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
generally  these credit losses have been within our expectations and the provisions established 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience credit loss rates similar to those we have experienced in the past 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated among a small number of customers  and a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the net realizable value of the inventory 
cost is determined on an average cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and includes raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next three to six months 
in addition  we consider changes in the market value of dram ics and nand in determining the realizable value of our raw material inventory 
once established  any write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of our inventories 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventories are sold 
in addition  should the market value of dram ics and nand decrease significantly  we may be required to lower our selling prices to reflect the lower cost of our raw materials 
if such price decreases reduce the realizable value of our inventories to less than our cost  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales in the same period 
although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological developments or the market value of dram ics and nand could have a material effect on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing our best estimates  appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
these projected future cash flows may vary significantly over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
stock based compensation 
we account for equity issuances to non employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods and services 
all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the third party performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation issued to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related pronouncements 
under this method  compensation expense was recognized over the respective vesting period based on the excess  on the date of grant  of the fair value of our common stock over the grant price  net of forfeitures 
deferred stock based compensation was amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each grant 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of adopting sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards 
while this model meets the requirements of sfas no 
r  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the black scholes model requires subjective assumptions regarding future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  along with assumptions about the risk free interest rate and expected dividends  all of which affect the estimated fair values of our stock based awards 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies based on our belief that we currently have limited historical data regarding the volatility of our stock price on which to base a meaningful estimate of expected volatility 
the risk free rate selected to value any particular grant is based on the us treasury rate that corresponds to the expected term of the grant effective as of the date of the grant 
the expected dividends assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
the value of the portion of stock based awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our financial statements in fiscal and thereafter 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional stock based awards 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  when determined necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we operate at a loss for an extended period of time or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets which could substantially increase our effective tax rate for such period 
any significant changes in statutory tax rates or the amount of our valuation allowance could have a material effect on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
additionally  we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  on december   the first day of fiscal fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement recognition of a tax position that has been taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
under fin we may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net total other income expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales  cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents net sales  cost of sales and gross profit for the years ended december  and december  in thousands  except percentages year ended december  december  decrease change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    gross margin net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by two primary factors 
first  the significant decreases in dram ic market prices during the period  which was primarily driven by continued oversupply in the dram market  forced us to significantly reduce our selling prices on many of our products 
additionally  we experienced decreases in demand as falling market prices generally led to expectations of further price reductions  which caused certain customers to delay purchases from us 
the decrease in net sales for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from decreases of i million in sales of our very low profile memory subsystems  ii million in sales of double data rate  or ddr and ddr memory subsystems and iii million in sales of other memory products  primarily with respect to certain of our upgrade and distribution business customers that were affected by the the overall downward market in these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales for as compared to of i million in sales of laptop personal computer memory subsystems and ii million in sales of memory subsystems used to control redundant arrays of independent disks  or raids 
the overall decreases in net sales are primarily attributable to the market driven reductions in selling prices of our products and lower customer demand as described above  particularly on our high volume products with lower average selling prices as well as overall lower than expected demand from oem products in which our products are incorporated  such as blade servers that use our very low profile memory subsystems 
should the market price declines for dram ics continue  our overall revenues could be adversely impacted as we lower prices further on some products to meet market conditions 
sales of our component inventory to distributors and other users of memory ics represented approximately and of net sales for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we expect that component inventory sales will decrease as a percentage of net sales in future periods as we diversify our customer base and therefore are able to use components in a wider range of memory subsystems 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the decrease in net sales between the two years 
the decrease in gross profit and gross margin for is also attributable to the significant decrease in the market price of dram ics during this market decline significantly impacted the valuation of our inventories  whereby we incurred a loss in the year ended december  of approximately million as a result of slow moving and lower of cost or market value inventory adjustments 
additionally  as a result of the overall decrease in demand that we experienced in  along with the start up costs to establish our new manufacturing facility in the people s republic of china  or prc  we incurred excess manufacturing capacity costs in of approximately million 
the declines in both gross profit and gross margin in were partially offset by certain shifts in product mix that provide for higher margins 
to the extent that dram ic market prices continue to decline  or should our product sales mix move toward lower margin products such as laptop memory  our gross profit  gross margin and overall operating results could be adversely affected in future periods 
research and development the following table presents research and development expenses for the years ended december  and december  in thousands  except percentages year ended december  december  increase change research and development    the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from increases of i million in personnel related expenses as a result of an increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities since december   along with increased expenses related to changes to our employee insurance plan coverage premiums and matching contributions to our employee k plan  ii million for certain engineering and design tools  product qualification and other related expenses along with million in legal and professional services fees as we increased activities related to new and emerging markets during  iii million for impairment write downs of certain long lived assets used in the product development process as further discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and iv million in various allocated overhead expenses

the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses are partially offset by decreases of i million in bad debt expense and ii million in commission related expenses due to our lower overall net sales in as compared to other income expense  net the following table presents other income expense for the years ended december  and december  in thousands  except percentages year ended december  december  increase change interest income expense  net   other income expense  net total other income expense  net   net interest income for the year ended december  was comprised of interest income of approximately million  partially offset by interest expense of approximately million 
the increase in net interest income during as compared to resulted primarily from i interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  which is attributable to the proceeds from our ipo in december and ii a decrease in interest expense due to our lower outstanding line of credit and debt balances in as compared to other income expense  net  primarily includes gains and losses on foreign currency transactions in and losses on dispositions of property and equipment 
provision benefit for income taxes the following table presents the provision benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and december  in thousands  except percentages year ended december  december  decrease change provision benefit for income taxes    the federal statutory rate was for fiscal and we recorded a benefit for income taxes due to a pre tax loss for the year ended december  as compared to a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  the differences between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate primarily relates to the benefit of lower federal tax brackets  state taxes and foreign losses recorded without tax benefits in fiscal and the benefit of lower federal tax brackets and state taxes in fiscal we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance including carryback opportunities to the extent available 
as a result of recent cumulative taxable income  a federal carryback opportunity  and projections of income in the near future  we have concluded that no valuation allowance should be recorded as of the end of as a result of our adoption of fin in fiscal  we recorded an increase in the net liability for unrecognized tax positions of approximately million  which was recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit as of december  included in the unrecognized tax benefits at december  was approximately million of tax positions that  if recognized  would affect our annual effective tax rate 
our continuing practice is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense 
this policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin at december   we had approximately  accrued for interest and accrued for penalties 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
in future periods  we will begin to operate under tax holidays in the prc  which are effective from january through december year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales  cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents net sales  cost of sales and gross profit for the years ended december  and december  in thousands  except percentages year ended december  december  increase change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    gross margin net sales 
approximately million of the increase in net sales for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was attributable to higher unit sales of our very low profile memory subsystems 
in addition  ddr server memory subsystem sales increased by million and ddr subsystem sales decreased by million due to customers transitioning to ddr architectures 
sales of memory subsystems used to control raids commenced late in the second quarter of fiscal and contributed million to the increase in revenues 
finally  sales of laptop and desktop personal computer  or pc  memory subsystems decreased million as we focused on sales of higher margin server memory subsystems 
sales of our component inventory to distributors and other users of memory ics represented and of net sales for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
such sales decreased primarily as a result of our efforts to diversify our customer base which has resulted in our ability to use components in a wider range of memory subsystems 
gross profit and gross margin 
the increase in both gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to increased sales of our very low profile memory subsystems and memory subsystems to control raids  which generate higher margins due to their innovative design  as well as lower margin products becoming a smaller portion of our overall product sales mix 
research and development the following table presents research and development expenses for the years ended december  and december  in thousands  except percentages year ended december  december  increase change research and development   the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is related primarily to increases of i million in personnel related expenses as a result of an increase in personnel  salaries and bonuses in fiscal and ii million in stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of i million in depreciation expense and ii million in outside services and professional fees

we have prepared the underlying unaudited financial statements on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report  which include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented

these fluctuations are primarily attributable to the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate  including changes in revenue related to additions of new customers  the ramp up of new products  products reaching the end of their life cycles  customers technology transitions  and other similar reasons 
as a result  we believe that the period to period comparisons of our net sales and operating results are not necessarily meaningful measures of future operating performance and should not be relied upon as indications of that future performance 
we expect that our future operating results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year  which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to fluctuate and decline

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of i approximately million in net non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of inventory adjustments  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of long lived assets and deferred income taxes and ii approximately million in net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by a net loss of approximately million 
accounts receivable decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of the overall decline in our net sales during the year 
during  we were successful in collecting cash from sales to our customers substantially in accordance with our standard payment terms to those customers 
inventories decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of i the overall decline in our net sales during the year  ii sales of inventories on hand during the current year to our customers  which generated net cash proceeds of approximately million in and iii a loss of approximately million due to slow moving and lower of cost or market value inventory adjustments 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based on  among other factors  the level of customer orders received and overall demand as well as the stage at which our products are in their respective life cycles and competitive situations in the marketplace 
we make efforts to balance such considerations against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
accounts payable decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of an overall decline in materials purchasing levels during the year given our decline in net sales 
cash payments primarily for the purchase of manufacturing materials and related goods for resale to our customers used net operating cash of approximately million during net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of approximately million in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by net income of approximately million and net non cash operating expenses of approximately million  primarily comprising depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
as compared to fiscal  the overall change in cash used in operating activities in was primarily due to an increase in cash flow related to net income of million offset by i a decrease in cash flow related to accounts receivable of million due to a higher proportion of net sales being generated by customers with longer payment terms  ii a decrease in cash flow related to net inventories of million as we increased inventory levels to support higher sales volumes and iii an increase in cash flow related to accounts payable of million as we trade financed our inventory increase and other operating expenses 
in addition  cash flow related to income taxes payable increased million as we attained profitability in the first half of and started to accumulate an income tax liability that was paid later in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of purchases of additional investments in marketable securities of approximately million  partially offset by proceeds received from maturities and sales of certain investments in marketable securities of approximately million 
in we continued to invest the majority of the proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  in various marketable securities investments in connection with our efforts to both preserve capital as well as achieve competitive returns on our investments 
we also used approximately million in cash primarily to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements related to our new facilities in the prc and in irvine  california 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of i purchases of investments in marketable securities of approximately million as a result of investing a portion of the proceeds from our ipo and ii purchases of manufacturing equipment of approximately in order to support increased sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of net repayments on our outstanding revolving line of credit of approximately million  along with net repayments on our long term debt of approximately million 
these repayments were slightly offset by approximately million in cash provided through the exercise of stock options during net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of i approximately million received as a result of the sale of common stock in our ipo  net of underwriters discounts and offering expenses of approximately million and ii approximately million in net borrowings of our revolving line of credit used to assist in financing our working capital needs as a result of significant growth in as compared to capital resources in august  we amended our credit agreement with our bank 
the credit agreement  as amended  provides for a revolving line of credit with maximum borrowings of million  a term loan of million  and an equipment financing line of credit with maximum borrowings of million 
prior to august  the credit agreement provided for a revolving line of credit of million and no term loan or equipment line of credit 
in august  we used approximately million of the proceeds from the term loan to repay convertible debt of  plus accrued interest that had become due 
the interest rate under the term loan was less than that of the convertible debt repaid 
in april  we executed a seventh amendment to our credit agreement with our bank  which was effective march  this amendment allows us  at our election  to increase our maximum borrowings on the line of credit from million  in million increments  up to a total of million 
in addition  among other terms  the amendment i extends the maturity date of the line of credit to july   ii establishes an equipment advance line of million  iii increases the sublimit for letters of credit to million  iv sets an inventory sublimit of million  subject to increase to million if certain targets are met and v provides for the reduction in interest rates on borrowings if certain borrowing amounts and financial performance targets are met 
in july  we executed an eighth amendment to our credit agreement  which was effective june   and which revised the various financial and other covenants of which we are required to comply 
the amendment requires us to i achieve minimum book net worth on a monthly basis  ii limit annual capital expenditures under a defined annual cap  iii achieve certain minimum monthly profitability thresholds and iv maintain a minimum liquidity threshold as of the end of each month 
while we are currently in compliance with all financial covenants and expect to maintain compliance for the foreseeable future  we have in the past been in violation of one or more covenants 
we cannot assure you that we will not violate one or more covenants in the future 
if we were to be in violation of covenants under our credit agreement  our lender could choose to accelerate payment on all outstanding loan balances 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing in this event 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of funding  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
under the revolving line of credit  we may borrow up to the greater of of eligible accounts receivable plus the least of i a percentage of eligible inventory determined from time to time by our bank  ii of the orderly liquidation value  as defined  of eligible inventories  and iii million 
interest is payable monthly at the prime rate of as of december  outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit were approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
borrowing availability as of december  was approximately million 
under the equipment financing line of credit  we may borrow up to of the cost of equipment purchases up to a maximum of million 
interest on equipment line of credit advances was payable at the prime rate plus prior to our initial public offering in december and was reduced to the prime rate thereafter 
principal is due monthly through the maturity date of the credit agreement in july  when all unpaid principal and interest is due 
outstanding borrowings under the equipment line of credit were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
any borrowings under the revolving and equipment lines of credit are collateralized by a general first priority lien against all of our assets  both tangible and intangible 
we have in the past utilized equipment leasing arrangements to finance capital expenditures 
equipment leases will continue to be a financing alternative that we may pursue in the future 
we believe our existing cash balances  our borrowing availability under our bank credit facility  and the cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our levels of net sales  the timing and extent of expenditures to support research and development activities  the expansion of manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally and the continued market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or may choose  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt or equity financing or a combination thereof 
these additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  in thousands within one year years years after years total scheduled payments under contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases   purchase commitments total    potential cash requirements under existing commitments letters of credit total    for purposes of the table above  obligations for purchase commitments are defined as agreements that represent a firm commitment and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase for which we generally have a contractual right to increase or decrease quantities as needed 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
we believe that funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commercial commitments and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity position 
new accounting pronouncements in june the fasb ratified eitf no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf no 
eitf no 
requires non refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and the payments to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed 
eitf no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our bank credit facility because borrowings under all lines under the facility are variable rate borrowings  generally at prime 
assuming that all lines under the facility are fully available and drawn and holding other variables constant  each increase in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings will result in an increase in annual interest expense and a decrease in our cash flows and income before taxes of approximately million per year 
to date  we have not used derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk related to our credit facility 
we have invested most of the proceeds of our initial public offering in securities which may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities  which meet high quality credit standards  as specified in our investment policy  and include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and auction rate securities 
our investment policy guidelines generally limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments 
our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are classified as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or sfas no 
 and are therefore stated at fair value 
differences between fair value and amortized cost are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are reported  net of taxes  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the fair value of our investments in marketable securities fluctuates based on changes in market conditions and interest rates  however  given the general short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant market or interest rate risk 
due to disruptions of  and the resulting reduced liquidity in certain financial markets in  two of our aaa rated auction rate securities with a total purchased cost of approximately million experienced failed auctions during the fourth quarter of due to the failed auctions  we were unable to sell the securities at their respective costs  resulting in a decrease in fair value which has been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in accordance with sfas no 
these investments have been classified as long term investments in marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  as of february   the unrealized loss on these two investments was approximately  we have concluded that the unrealized losses on these two investments are temporary because i we believe that the decline in market value that has occurred is due to general market conditions  ii the auction rate securities continue to be of a high credit quality and interest is paid as due and iii we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until a recovery in market value occurs 
the fair value of these securities could change significantly in the future and we may be required to record other than temporay impairment charges or additional unrealized losses in future periods 
unrealized losses on certain of our other investments as of the end of were due primarily to changes in interest rates 
we have determined that the unrealized losses on all of our investments in marketable securities at december  are temporary in nature 
we review our investments to evaluate indications of possible impairment 
factors considered in determining whether impairments are other than temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee and our intent and ability to hold an investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
the carrying value  maturity and estimated fair value of our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities as of december  were as follows in thousands  except interest rates maturity carrying value december  within one year after december  greater than one year after december  fair value december  investments cash equivalents    weighted average interest rate marketable securities     weighted average interest rate exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales to our customers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
as a result of our foreign operations  we have certain costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  and therefore  decreases in the value of the us dollar could result in increases in our manufacturing costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have not used derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
