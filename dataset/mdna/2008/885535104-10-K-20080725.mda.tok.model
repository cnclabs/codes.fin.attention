we also work with service providers to deliver managed networking solutions for enterprise customers 
headquartered in marlborough  massachusetts  we have worldwide operations  including sales  marketing  research and development  and customer service and support capabilities 
our products and services can generally be classified in the following categories networking  security  voice  services  and legacy connectivity products 

table of contents we have undergone significant changes in recent years  including significant changes to our executive leadership  the formation and subsequent percent acquisition of our china based hc subsidiary  financing a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of hc by entering into a million senior secured credit agreement  acquiring tippingpoint technologies  inc  restructuring activities  which included outsourcing of information technology  all manufacturing activity in our dvbu segment  significant headcount reductions in other functions  and selling excess facilities  the termination of the proposed acquisition of the company by affiliates of bain capital partners  and changing our reporting segments to align with the way we manage our business 
we believe an overview of some of these significant recent events is helpful to gain a clearer understanding of our operating results 
significant events hc on november   we formed hc  formerly known as the huawei com joint venture  with a subsidiary of huawei technologies  ltd 
huawei 
hc is domiciled in hong kong  and has its principal operating center in hangzhou  china 
two years after formation of hc  we entered into an agreement to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest in hc from huawei for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the acquisition occurred on january  at which time we owned a majority interest in the joint venture and  therefore  consolidated hc s financial statements beginning february  
on march   com paid million to purchase huawei s remaining interest in hc 
we financed a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of huawei s percent ownership in hc through a million senior secured credit agreement with several lenders 
as such  hc was a wholly owned subsidiary for as compared to the previous year when we owned percent and huawei had a minority ownership 
new products we have introduced multiple new products targeted at the small  medium and large enterprise markets  including modular and multi service switches and routers  converged ip solutions such as voice  video and surveillance  security  and unified switching solutions 
we have also announced our open services networking  or osn  strategy which provides customers with options to integrate best of breed application solutions directly into their networks 
business environment and future trends networking industry analysts and participants differ widely in their assessments concerning the prospects for near term industry growth  especially in light of the current weakness in many of the major global economies 
industry factors and trends also present significant challenges in the medium term with respect to our goals for sales growth  profitability and the generation of increased cash flow from operations 
such factors and trends include intense competition in the market for higher end  enterprise core routing and switching products  aggressive product pricing by competitors targeted at gaining share in market segments where we have had a strong position historically  such as the small to medium sized enterprise market  and the advanced nature and ready availability of merchant silicon  which allows low end competitors to deliver competitive products and makes it increasingly difficult for us to differentiate our products 
we believe that long term success in this environment requires us to be a global technology leader  increase our revenue and take market share from competitors 
we believe that our differentiated product portfolio which offers end to end ip solutions based on open standards offers a compelling value proposition for customers 
our intention is to leverage our global footprint to more effectively sell these products 

table of contents we hope to achieve our goal of revenue growth by executing on three region centric growth strategies as follows china in china  we have been successful in direct touch sales to enterprise customers and selling our offerings to the carrier market through our huawei oem relationship 
with the end of our joint venture with huawei we expect declining sales to huawei  although we anticipate they will remain a strategic partner for sales into the carrier market 
to maintain our market leadership position in china we intend to increase our focus on direct touch sales as well as pursue other channels into the carrier market 
we believe that growing market share in china will be more challenging than in the past given that we already have a significant enterprise networking market share in china 
emerging markets outside of china we expect to target growth opportunities outside of china in other developing markets 
we believe that our successful penetration of the chinese market has positioned us to grow sales in developing markets generally 
developed global markets our ability to achieve our goal of sales growth in developed markets depends to a substantial degree on our ability to take market share from our competitors 
our strategy in developed markets centers around leveraging targeted selling and marketing investments into the small and increasingly the medium business segment of the enterprise networking market 
these sales efforts are currently expected to focus on our open source  open architecture platforms  and our comprehensive portfolio of differentiated networking offerings 
finally  we believe that our success is dependent on our ability to increase our overall margins and cash generation 
we believe that by accelerating the integration of our worldwide operations we can achieve further operational efficiencies which will allow us to support our continued investment in sales and marketing 
we may require certain targeted investments in the integration of our business infrastructure designed to drive more profitable near and long term growth 
for our tippingpoint business we plan to focus on growing its top line and improving operational efficiency and segment profitability 
in addition  our current goal is to maximize tippingpoint s value and continue it on its path to greater operational autonomy 
termination of proposed acquisition of the company on september   we announced an agreement to be acquired by an entity controlled by affiliates of bain capital partners  or newco 
on march   an affiliate of bain capital partners  llc sent a letter to us purporting to terminate our merger agreement dated september   or the merger agreement 
we terminated the merger agreement  by letters dated april  and april   as a result of newco s failure to consummate the merger in accordance with the merger agreement 
as previously disclosed  we intend to seek payment of the million termination fee from newco under the merger agreement payable under certain circumstances  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect all or any portion of the termination fee 
segment reporting based on the information provided to our chief operating decision maker codm for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance  we review the operations of the business by looking at four reporting segments 
in prior fiscal years we reported two segments  scn and hc 
in fiscal  we have realigned our internal reporting and  as a result  we have changed our segment reporting to be in line with the way we are now internally managing our business 
this change breaks out the scn segment into the data and voice business unit dvbu  our tippingpoint security division tippingpoint and corporate expenses corporate 
basis of presentation our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to may fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on may  fiscal year  consisted of weeks ended on june   and fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on june  for convenience  the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 

table of contents during fiscal we purchased an additional two percent ownership interest in hc  giving us a percent ownership interest 
we determined it was then appropriate to consolidate hc s financial statements 
from that time until we became a percent owner  as discussed below  we also recorded huawei s proportionate share of the income of hc as a minority interest in the income of consolidated joint venture 
prior to the additional percent acquisition we accounted for our investment in hc by the equity method 
under this method  we recorded our proportionate share of hc s net income or loss based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements of hc under the caption equity interest in income of unconsolidated joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
both joint venture partners subsequently had the right to offer to buy the other s remaining ownership in hc 
our com technologies subsidiary completed the purchase of huawei s remaining interest in hc for million in march huawei com co  limited is now known as hc technologies co  limited  or hc 
on may   our subsidiary hc holdings limited borrower entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with various lenders  including goldman sachs credit partners lp  as mandated lead arranger  bookrunner  administrative agent and syndication agent  and industrial and commercial bank of china asia limited  as collateral agent the credit agreement 
under the original credit agreement  the borrower borrowed million in the form of a senior secured term loan to finance a portion of the purchase price for com s acquisition of percent of hc discussed above 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which appear in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation revenue recognition we recognize a sale when the product has been delivered and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the fee is fixed or determinable 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable considers whether a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms 
if we determine that the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue at the time the fee becomes due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
also  sales arrangements may contain customer specific acceptance requirements for both products and services 
in such cases  revenue is deferred at the time of delivery of the product or service and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements that are not considered software arrangements  such as sales of hardware products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and objective evidence of the fair value of all the undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of the fee is not reasonably assured  then we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
we do not typically request collateral from our customers 
in the hc segment  certain customers pay accounts receivable with notes receivable from chinese banks with maturities less than six months 
these are also referred to as bankers acceptances 
a significant portion of our sales is made to distributors and value added resellers vars 
revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales to these customers are recorded net of appropriate allowances  including estimates for product returns  price protection  and excess channel inventory levels 
we maintain reserves for potential allowances and adjustments  if the actual level of returns and adjustments differ from the assumptions we use to develop those reserves  additional allowances and charges might be required 

table of contents for sales of products that contain software that is marketed separately  we apply the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we generally sell our software products with maintenance services  which includes the rights to updates and enhancements  and  in some cases  also with consulting services 
for these undelivered elements  we determine vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with product based on the amount that will be separately charged for the maintenance renewal period 
we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 
we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method  provided that the above criteria have been met 
under the residual method  revenue associated with undelivered elements is deferred based on vsoe  and any remaining amounts are considered related to the delivered elements and recognized providing all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
sales of services  including professional services  system integration  project management  and training  are recognized upon delivery of the service 
royalty revenue is generally recognized when any performance by com is complete and payment has been received 
allowance for doubtful accounts we monitor payments from our customers on an on going basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts  and geographic and political risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or net realizable value 
we perform detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of inventory on an ongoing basis  for both inventory on hand and inventory that we are committed to purchase  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to cost of sales might be required  alternatively  we might realize benefits through cost of sales for sale or disposition of inventory that had been previously written off 
goodwill and intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting literature 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we review the value of our intangible assets in accordance with the applicable accounting literature for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we conducted an additional impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets due to the decline of our stock price which resulted in a million impairment charge to our tippingpoint goodwill as discussed in note as of may   we had million of goodwill and million of net intangible assets remaining on our balance sheet  which we currently believe to be realizable based on the estimated fair value of these assets 
we estimate the fair value of goodwill using third party valuation reports and the fair value of our intangible assets using estimated future cash flows of the associated products and technology 
it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the carrying value of these assets  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be re evaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of these assets 

table of contents equity securities and other investments we account for non marketable equity securities and other investments at historical cost or  if we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee  by the equity method 
investments accounted for by the equity method include investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and  prior to the acquisition of majority ownership on january   the investment in hc 
in accounting for these investments by the equity method  we record our proportionate share of the fund s net income or loss  or hc s net income or loss  based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements 
since hc has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we reported our equity in hc s net income or loss based on hc s most recent quarterly financial statements  two months in arrears 
for the year ended may  we accounted for hc under the equity method for ten months of the year 
at may  we no longer held any equity securities 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  which requires all stock based compensation to employees as defined in sfas no 
r  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock awards  and restricted stock units  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
estimates of the fair value of equity awards in future periods will be affected by the market price of our common stock  as well as the actual results of certain assumptions used to value the equity awards 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected volatility of the common stock  the expected term of options granted  and the risk free interest rate 
the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares is determined by using the black scholes option pricing model and applying the single option approach to the stock option valuation 
the options generally have vesting on an annual basis over a vesting period of four years 
we estimate the expected option term by analyzing the historical term period from grant to exercise and also considers the expected term for those options that are outstanding 
the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period 
the volatility of the common stock is estimated using historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model is determined by looking at historical us treasury zero coupon bond issues with terms corresponding to the expected terms of the equity awards 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model  because we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
lastly  in accordance with sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in order to determine an estimated pre vesting option forfeiture rate  we analyzed historical forfeiture data  which yielded a current forfeiture rate of percent as of the end of the current fiscal year 
we believe this historical forfeiture rate to be reflective of our anticipated rate on a go forward basis 
an estimated forfeiture rate has been applied to all unvested options and restricted stock outstanding as of june  and to all options and restricted stock granted since june  therefore  stock based compensation expense is recorded only for those options and restricted stock that are expected to vest 
restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives have required us to record restructuring charges related to severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  accelerated depreciation and write downs of held for sale properties  write downs of other long term assets  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of our restructuring activities and the time required for execution and completion of such activities  the process of estimating restructuring charges is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments requires us to record charges when we have taken actions or have the appropriate approval for taking action  and when a liability is incurred 
our policies require us to periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
as we continue to evaluate the business  we might be required to record additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
product warranty a limited warranty is provided on most of our products for periods ranging from days to limited lifetime  depending upon the product  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales might be required 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income tax in a number of jurisdictions 
a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes  and it is reasonably possible those such assets may not be recovered and that such liabilities may not be paid or that payments in excess of amounts initially estimated and accrued may be required 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on various factors  including our recent losses  retained deficit  operating performance in fiscal  and estimates of future profitability  we have concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover most of net deferred tax assets as of may  accordingly  we have established an appropriate valuation allowance to offset such deferred tax assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  that clarifies the accounting and recognition for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
fin provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted fin on june   which resulted in no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
as of may  the company had unrecognized tax benefits of million including interest  if recognized  all of which would affect our effective tax rate 
we recognize tax liabilities for uncertain items in accordance with fin and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
as of may   the amount of interest included in unrecognized tax benefits was million  representing an increase of million from the date of adoption 
there were no penalties accrued in all periods presented 
we have net operating loss carryforwards related to the following income tax jurisdictions and expiration periods us federal loss carryforwards of approximately billion expiring between fiscal years and  substantially all of which expire between fiscal years and  various state loss carryforwards of approximately billion expiring between and  and various foreign loss carryforwards of million expiring between and  and million with an unlimited carryforward period 
results of operations years ended may    and in prior fiscal years we reported two segments  scn and hc 
in fiscal  we have realigned our internal reporting and  as a result  we have changed our segment reporting  to four reporting segments  to be in line with the way we are now internally managing our business 
this change breaks out the scn segment into the data and voice business unit dvbu  our tippingpoint security division tippingpoint and corporate expenses corporate 
we do not use any allocation methods to distribute these corporate expenses to our operating business units 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
sales cost of sales gross profit margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization goodwill impairment in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss gain on investments  net interest expense income  net other income  net loss from operations before income taxes  equity interest in income of unconsolidated joint venture and minority interest in income of consolidated joint venture income tax benefit provision equity interest in income of unconsolidated joint venture minority interest in income of consolidated joint venture net loss comparison of fiscal and during the year ended may  we continued to experience increased performance in our hc and tippingpoint segments offset by declines in our dvbu segment and we continued to reduce operating expenses in our dvbu business segment  offset in part by investment in dvbu services 
sales the following table shows our sales from products categories in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales for fiscal and fiscal in millions fiscal year networking security voice services legacy connectivity products total networking revenue includes sales of our layer and layer stackable managed switching lines  our modular switching lines  routers  ip storage and our small to medium sized enterprise market products 
sales of our networking products in fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the increase in sales was primarily driven by expansion in our global sales of hc developed products  an appreciation on the renminbi related to our sales in china  partially offset by reduced sales to huawei and slower than expected sales in our north america region 

table of contents security revenue includes our tippingpoint products and services  as well as other security products  such as our embedded firewall  or efw and virtual private network  or vpn  products 
sales of our security products in fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increased sales of our tippingpoint products in our north america region due to certain significant customers wins and slightly increased sales on a global basis 
voice revenue includes our vcx and nbx voice over internet protocol  or voip  product lines  as well as voice gateway offerings 
sales of our voip telephony products in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal due primarily to decreased sales in north america 
services revenue includes professional services and maintenance contracts  excluding tippingpoint maintenance which is included in security revenue 
services revenue in fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the increase was driven primarily by increased service sales tied to growth in networking 
legacy connectivity products revenue includes our legacy network interface card  personal computer card  and mini peripheral component interconnect offerings 
at the end of fiscal sales of these products are negligible with continued revenue only expected to be from royalty arrangements 
sales by geographic region are as follows in millions fiscal year china europe  middle east  and africa north america asia pacific excluding china latin and south america total sales information by geography to the extent available is reported based on the customer s designated delivery point  except in the case of hc s oem sales which are based on the hub locations of hc s oem partners 
sales in our china region in fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this increase is primarily due to the appreciation of the renminbi as well as increased direct touch china sales  partially offset by decreased sales to huawei 
sales in our europe  middle east  and africa region in fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to increased effectiveness of market penetration in this region  especially in networking and security products 
sales in our north america region in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal this decrease is primarily due to weakness in sales of our voice solutions and an economic slowdown as well as perceived apprehension in the market related to the now terminated proposed acquisition of the company by affiliates of bain capital  partially offset by increased sales of our tippingpoint products in our north america region due to demand for security solutions including several large customer wins 
sales in our asia pacific region excluding china in fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to increased effectiveness of market penetration in this region  especially in networking products 
sales in our latin and south america region in fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to increased effectiveness of market penetration in this region  especially in networking products 

table of contents gross margin gross margin by segment is as follows fiscal year hc dvbu tippingpoint intercompany eliminations and other gross margin gross margin in our hc segment improved points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin is driven by favorable product mix  improved pricing of products and reduced costs of products 
gross margin in our dvbu segment decreased points to percent in fiscal from percent in the previous fiscal year 
the decline is primarily explained by costs associated with our change from an outsourced service provider to a hybrid of outsourced and in house performance of services to our customers and increased inter company pricing  offset in part by product cost reductions 
gross margin in our tippingpoint segment improved points to percent in fiscal from percent in the previous fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to more favorable product mix of sales in the current fiscal year  offset in part by certain cost increases 
gross margin related to intercompany eliminations and other increased points to percent in fiscal from percent in the previous fiscal year 
this category contains our intercompany eliminations and other items  which includes mainly the amortization of the purchase accounting step up in inventory from our acquisition of the remaining percent of hc 
the effect of the purchase accounting amortization was included in the first six months of our fiscal  but was not present in the last six months or any of the prior year periods presented 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million  or percent 
the increase primarily relates to a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as increased amortization costs of million due to a full year of amortization expense in current fiscal period as opposed to one day of amortization expense related to the percent purchase of hc in the prior fiscal year and to a lesser extent costs related to the now terminated proposed acquisition of the company by affiliates of bain capital of million  a law firm success fee of million related to the jury verdict in our realtek litigation a dispute which we resolved favorably through an agreement with realtek to provide it with nonexclusive licenses in exchange for million of license fees expected to be paid in the first quarter  a million charge related to expenses incurred in connection with tippingpoint s then proposed ipo  and million of increased fasr expenses 
these expenses were partially offset by the absence of a change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program  which contributed compensation expenses of million in the year ended may  as well as in process research and development expenses of million in the year ended may  as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were percent  compared to percent in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal  an increase of million in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that to a significant degree  these expenses are controllable and discretionary over time  but they are not directly variable with sales levels within a particular period 
the most significant component of the increase of million was the incurrence of deal related costs of million related to the now terminated proposed acquisition of the company  a law firm success fee of million related to the jury verdict in our realtek litigation  increased fas r expenses of million  tippingpoint ipo related costs of million and increased spending in all areas partially offset by the absence of change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program  which contributed compensation expenses of million in the year ended may  
table of contents a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in hc sales and marketing expenses partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses in dvbu and tippingpoint 
the million decrease in hc primarily relates to the absence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program of million in the prior fiscal period partially offset by investments in the hc direct touch sales force 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to decreased spending in dvbu and tippingpoint partially offset by increased spending in our hc segment 
the decrease in the dvbu segment of million primarily relates to integration of research and development activities formerly handled by dvbu into our hc segment 
the increase of million in our hc segment was due to these activities and increased investment in research and development  offset in part by the absence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program of million in the prior fiscal period 
the tippingpoint segment decreased million from the prior fiscal year due to constricted spending 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million from fiscal this increase is primarily due to the incurrence of deal related costs of million related to the now terminated proposed acquisition of the company  a law firm success fee of million related to the jury verdict in our realtek litigation a dispute which we resolved favorably through an agreement with realtek to provide it with nonexclusive licenses in exchange for million of license fees expected to be paid in the first quarter  a million charge related to tippingpoint ipo related costs  and million of increased fasr expenses partially offset by the absence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program of million in the year ended may  amortization 
amortization was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million 
amortization increased due primarily to the inclusion of hc amortization expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  the fiscal amortization expense related to the march  purchase of percent of hc in was through march  as we record hc results on a two month lag 
in process research and development 
in fiscal million of the total purchase price of our acquisition of huawei s remaining minority interest in hc was allocated to in process research and development and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
at the time of acquisition  hc had multiple in process research and development efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
we had no in process research and development charges in fiscal restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal and were the result of reductions in workforce and continued efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities 
further actions may be taken if our business activity declines or additional cost reduction efforts are necessary

interest expense income and other income  net interest expense income and other income  net  was million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was net interest expense in fiscal of million compared to interest income of million in fiscal the net change in interest expense relates to the interest expense from the million of debt incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as decreased interest income from our reduced cash balance in the current fiscal year 
partially offsetting the increase in interest expense was an increase of million of other income from hc for an operating subsidy program by the chinese vat authorities in the form of a partial refund of vat taxes collected by hc from purchasers of software products 

table of contents income tax benefit provision we had an income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to an income tax provision of million in fiscal the income tax benefit for fiscal was primarily the result of the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million as a result of the effective settlement of certain foreign examinations 
this benefit was partially offset by the revaluation in the third quarter of our deferred assets and liabilities relating to our hc subsidiary in china 
the net effect of these revaluations was an increase in our tax provision for fiscal of million 
under the new prc tax law  effective january   companies which qualify as new and high technology companies will pay corporate income tax at a reduced rate of 
based on the draft regulations  we believe that our hc subsidiary in china will qualify for this reduced rate 
however  the final regulations and the detailed application process have not yet been announced 
even though we expect our long term income tax rate in china to be  accounting rules require us to revalue our deferred tax balances to the enacted statutory rates until such time as we qualify for the reduced rate 
this is discussed further in risk factors above 
the balance of the net benefit for the year was the result of providing for taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
notwithstanding the issue discussed above  our hc subsidiary in china is currently entitled to tax concessions which began in and exempted it from the prc income tax for its initial two years and entitle it to a percent reduction in income tax in the following three years 
will be the final year of those tax concessions 
consequently  until such time as we receive approval for the reduced long term rate of percent  we currently expect the hc statutory rate in china to be percent for the calendar year  and  on the expectation that we qualify for the reduced rate  percent thereafter 
if we do not qualify for the reduced rate  the statutory income tax rate in china will be for  for  for  and thereafter

minority interest in income of consolidated joint venture in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to the acquisition of the percent interest in hc held by huawei prior to our purchase 
in fiscal we had no minority interest 
comparison of fiscal and during the year ended june  we experienced strong results in our hc segment and improved results in our tippingpoint segment offset by declines in our dvbu segment s sales and we reduced operating expenses in our dvbu business segment  offset in part by investment in the tippingpoint security business 
sales the increase in sales from the fiscal year to the fiscal year was primarily due to the inclusion of full year hc sales in the current period  as well as increased sales of tippingpoint security products 
the increase was partially offset by decreases in networking revenues in our dvbu segment 
the following table shows our sales from products categories in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales for fiscal and fiscal in millions fiscal year networking security voice services connectivity products total 
table of contents networking revenue includes sales of our layer and layer stackable managed switching lines  our modular switching lines  routers  wireless switching offerings and our small to medium sized enterprise market products 
sales of our networking products in fiscal increased percent from fiscal the increase in sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of full year results from our hc segment offset in part by decreases in dvbu sales 
security revenue includes our tippingpoint products and services  as well as other security products in our hc and dvbu segments  such as virtual private network  or vpn  and network access control  or nac  offerings 
sales of our security products in fiscal increased percent from fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to organic growth in sales of our tippingpoint segment s security products in fiscal and the inclusion of hc s full year results of security product sales 
voice revenue includes our vcx and nbx voice over internet protocol  or voip  product lines  as well as voice gateway offerings

china sales increased percent primarily due to the inclusion of hc results for the full year in fiscal gross margin gross margin by segment is as follows fiscal year hc dvbu tippingpoint intercompany eliminations and other gross margin gross margin in our hc segment decreased points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decline in gross margin was primarily driven by increased intercompany sales with lower margins 
gross margin in our dvbu segment decreased points to percent in fiscal from percent in the previous fiscal year 
the decline is primarily explained by less favorable product mix  price reductions and to a lesser extent decreased sales volume  partially offset by product cost reductions 

table of contents gross margin in our tippingpoint segment decreased points to percent in fiscal from percent in the previous fiscal year 
this decline was primarily due to increased costs due to product quality issues incurred in fiscal year gross margin related to intercompany eliminations and other increased points to percent in fiscal from percent in the previous fiscal year 
this category contains our intercompany eliminations and other items in fiscal which were not present in the prior fiscal year  which primarily includes the amortization of the purchase accounting step up in inventory from our acquisition of the remaining percent of hc 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
included in the increase in operating expenses were hc operating expenses of million for the full year ended may  as compared to million for the two months consolidated in in addition  the incurrence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program contributed compensation expenses of million in the year ended may   which were not incurred in the previous fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by significant cost reduction in our dvbu segment as compared to the previous year 
the full year inclusion of hc was the primary contributor to increases in sales and marketing expenses of million  research and development expenses of million  general and administrative expenses of million  and amortization of intangibles of million 
purchase accounting charges related to the acquisition of the remaining percent interest of hc was the main contributor to the increase in in process research and development of million 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease of restructuring charges of million 
as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were percent  compared to percent in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal  and increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that to a significant degree  these expenses are controllable and discretionary over time  but they are not directly variable with sales levels within a particular period 
the most significant component of the increase of million was the inclusion of million of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  partially offset by significant cost reductions in our dvbu segment 
a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  in addition  the incurrence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program contributed compensation expenses of million in our hc segment in the year ended may  the expenses were not incurred in the fiscal year and were partially offset by a reduction in the dvbu sales and marketing expenses 
the reduction of the dvbu sales and marketing expenses were primarily related to the reduction of programmatic marketing expenses  and a reduction in employee related expenses due to our restructuring efforts

the decrease in the dvbu research and development costs was related to reduced non recurring engineering projects and employee related expenses which was slightly offset by increased investment in tippingpoint research and development 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million from fiscal this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  in addition  the incurrence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program contributed compensation expenses of million in our hc segment in the year ended may  these expenses were not incurred in the previous fiscal year and were partially offset by a reduction in the corporate segment general and administrative expenses 
the reduction of the corporate segment general and administrative expenses were primarily related to the reduced workforce related expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and reduced it and facilities related expenses 

table of contents amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million 
amortization and write down of intangibles increased due primarily to the inclusion of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  the amortization expense related to the march  purchase of percent of hc in is through march  as we record hc results on a two month lag 
in process research and development 
million of the total purchase price of percent of the remaining minority interest in hc was preliminarily allocated to in process research and development and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
at the time of acquisition  hc had multiple in process research and development efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal  including employee severance and outplacement costs of million  and facilities related credits of million 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of reductions in workforce and continued efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities

interest income and other income expense  net interest and other income  net  was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million in fiscal contributing to the increase was million of other income from hc for an operating subsidy program by the chinese vat authorities in the form of a partial refund of vat taxes collected by hc from purchasers of software products 
an increase in interest income accounted for million of the increase  primarily attributable to higher interest rates applicable to short term investments and the inclusion of a full year of results of hc 
interest income and interest expense related to hc are included through the period ended march  thus  there is only three days of interest expense recorded related to the debt incurred on march  in fiscal our results reflected a quarterly vat payment that was received during the two month period of hc s results that are in our consolidated financials 
future subsidy payments  which are funded by vat receipts  are subject to the discretion of chinese vat authorities 
income tax provision benefit our income tax provision was million in fiscal  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the income tax provision for fiscal was the result of providing for taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
the tax benefit for fiscal was the result of a million benefit resulting from a tax settlement with foreign tax authorities in the second quarter of fiscal  for which reserves had been provided in prior years and which have now been reversed into income upon reaching settlement 
partially offsetting the income tax benefit for fiscal was the provision of additional taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
minority interest in the income of consolidated joint venture in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to the acquisition of the percent interest in hc held by huawei prior to our purchase

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents as of may  were million  a decrease of approximately million compared to the balance of million as of may  these balances were comprised of the following in millions cash and equivalents short term investments cash and equivalents and short term investments the may  and balance included cash and equivalents in our hc segment of million and million  respectively 
the following table shows the major components of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the last three fiscal years years ended may  in millions cash and equivalents  beginning of period net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities other cash and equivalents  end of period other primarily represents currency exchange appreciation for cash held in renminbi net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal the cash generation was largely due to non cash adjustments to our net loss which included million of goodwill impairment  million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation  as well as significant reductions in inventories and other assets  which were partially offset by our net loss and decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
based on current business conditions and our current operating and financial plans  we believe that our existing cash and equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash and debt payment requirements for at least the next months 
significant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under debt  lease  contract manufacturing and outsourcing agreements  as shown in the following table in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total one year years years years operating leases purchase commitments with contract manufacturers long term debt outsourcing agreements total includes dvbu  tippingpoint and corporate segment obligations as of may  and hc segment obligations as of march  as discussed in note income taxes  we have recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million 
this liability is included in the balance sheet under the caption deferred taxes and long term obligations 
the table above excludes this liability because it is not possible to estimate with reasonable certainty if or when any or all of the liability will be settled in cash 

table of contents we have entered into purchase agreements with our contract manufacturers 
pursuant to these agreements  if our actual orders and purchases fall below forecasted levels  we may be required to purchase finished goods inventory manufactured to meet our requirements 
in addition  we may be required to purchase raw material and work in process inventory on hand that is unique to our products  and we may be required to compensate the contract manufacturers with respect to their non cancelable purchase orders for such inventory 
the amount shown in the table above represents our estimate of inventory held by contract manufacturers that we could be required to purchase within the next months 
we do not expect any such required purchases to exceed our requirements for inventory to meet expected sales of our products to our customers 
represents required principal payments on our senior secured loan  but does not include required excess cash flow payments  for periods greater than one year  which are dependent on whether hc generates any excess cash flow 
under our it outsourcing agreements and research and development agreement we are subject to service level commitments and contractor commitments levels providing for annual minimum payments that vary depending on the levels we choose 
the amounts shown in the table above represent the amounts that would be payable  based on current levels  through the expiration of the agreements 
however  our it agreement may be terminated at any time upon days notice and the payment of a termination fee of approximately million  and our research and development agreement may be terminated at any time with a million payment 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of may  other than ordinary course of business purchases of computer hardware  software and leasehold improvements which we generally believe to be consistent with prior practice 
in addition  although no firm commitments exist today  as we further develop our worldwide integration plans we may decide to make capital expenditure investments in infrastructure to support a more integrated company in amounts which could be material 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  including million of outflows related to the purchase of property and equipment 
we made no equity investments in fiscal and million in fiscal  in municipal and corporate bonds  government agency instruments and equity securities 
in august  we sold certain venture capital limited partnership interests and generated cash of approximately million with a gain on sale of investment of million and eliminated our future capital call requirements 
proceeds from maturities and sales of municipal and corporate bonds  government agency instruments and equity securities were million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in the million were sales of our remaining venture portfolio investments that generated cash of approximately million

net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  which includes million of payments under our hc loans  including a million prepayment due to excess operating cash flows from our hc segment 
during fiscal  we also repurchased shares of restricted stock valued at million upon vesting of awards from employees consisting of shares to satisfy the tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with such vesting 
this was offset by proceeds of million from issuances of our common stock upon exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  we entered a new agreement facilitating the issuance of standby letters of credit and bank guarantees required in the normal course of business 
as of may   such bank issued standby letters of credit and guarantees totaled million  including million relating to potential foreign tax  custom  and duty assessments 
during fiscal  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase and option plans with total proceeds from such issuances of million 
as of may   our outstanding stock options as a percentage of outstanding shares were percent 
on may   our subsidiary hc holdings limited borrower entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with various lenders  including goldman sachs credit partners lp  as mandated lead arranger  bookrunner  administrative agent and syndication agent  and industrial and commercial bank of china asia limited  as collateral agent the credit agreement 
under the original credit agreement  the borrower borrowed million in the form of a senior secured term loan with two tranches tranche a and tranche b to finance a portion of the purchase price for com s acquisition of percent of hc technologies co  limited  or hc 
remaining principal is million as of may  and the final loan maturity date is on september  
table of contents interest on borrowings is payable semi annually on march and september all amounts outstanding under the tranche a term facility will bear interest  at the borrower s option  at the i libor  or ii base rate ie  prime rate  in each case plus the applicable margin percentage set forth in the table below  which is based on a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness of the borrower and its subsidiaries to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the relevant twelve month period leverage ratio libor base rate but but all amounts outstanding under the tranche b term facility will bear interest  at the borrower s option  at the i libor plus percent or ii base rate ie  prime rate plus percent 
we have elected to use libor as the reference rate for borrowings to date  and expect to do so for the foreseeable future 
applicable libor rates at year end were percent and the effective interest rate is percent for the tranche a term facility and percent for the tranche b term facility 
covenants and other restrictions under the credit agreement apply to the borrower and its subsidiaries  which we refer to as the hc group  but not to com s dvbu  tippingpoint and corporate segments 
the loans are secured by assets at the hc level 
hc also guarantees the loans 
the loans may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty 
the borrower will be required to make mandatory prepayments using net proceeds from hc group i asset sales  ii insurance proceeds and iii equity offerings or debt incurrence 
in addition  the borrower will be required to make annual prepayments in an amount equal to percent of excess cash flow of the hc group 
this percentage will decrease to the extent that the borrower s leverage ratio is lower than specified amounts 
any excess cash flow amounts not required to prepay the loan may be distributed to and used by the company s other segments  provided certain conditions are met 
the borrower must maintain a minimum debt service coverage  minimum interest coverage  maximum capital expenditures and a maximum total leverage ratio 
negative covenants restrict  among other things  i the incurrence of indebtedness by the borrower and its subsidiaries  ii the making of dividends and distributions to com s other segments  iii the ability to make investments including in new subsidiaries  iv the ability to undertake mergers and acquisitions and v sales of assets 
also  cash dividends from the prc subsidiaries to hc  and hc to the borrower  will be subject to restricted use pending payment of principal  interest and excess cash flow prepayments 
standard events of default and defaulted interest rates apply 
remaining payments of the million principal on the loans are due as follows on september  for fiscal years ending may in thousands tranche a tranche b the closing of the remaining percent acquisition of hc triggered a bonus program for substantially all of hc s approximately  employees 
this program  which was implemented by huawei and com in a prior period  is called the equity appreciation rights plan  or earp  and funds a bonus pool based upon a percentage of the appreciation in hc s value from the initiation of the program to the time of the closing of the acquisition 
a portion of the program is also based on cumulative earnings of hc 
the total value of the earp is expected to be approximately million 
approximately million related to cumulative earnings and change in control was accrued by march  and was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year at may   we accrued million for the fiscal earp plan which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal year we expect the unvested portion amounting to million will be accrued in hc operating segment over the next fiscal years serving as a continued retention and incentive program for hc employees 
the only stipulation for payout is that the participants remain employed with the company on the date of the payout which is required to be made within a specified period after the anniversary date of our percent hc acquisition on march  
table of contents remaining cash payment requirements under the equity appreciation rights plan for fiscal years ending may are approximately as follows in thousands it is expected that we will have significant cash outflows in fiscal of million of loan payments for principal and interest and approximately million for earp commitments 
on july   we entered into three agreements with realtek group which document the resolution of the patent dispute between the parties and provide for the non exclusive license by com to realtek of certain patents and related network interface technology for license fees totaling million

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements for additional information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
interest to be paid by us on our senior secured loan is at an interest rate based  at our option  on either the libor or the prime rate  plus an applicable margin 
we expect the base interest rate generally to be based on the published libor rate  which is subject to change on a periodic basis 
recently  interest rates have trended upwards in major global financial markets 
if these interest rate trends continue  this will result in increased interest rate expense as a result of higher libor rates 
continued increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  particularly if such increases are substantial 
in addition  interest rate trends could affect global economic conditions 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on corporate financial results by hedging existing foreign currency exposures and anticipated foreign currency transactions expected to occur within one month 
anticipated foreign currency transaction exposures with a maturity profile in excess of one month may be selectively hedged 
translation exposures are not hedged 
due to the limitations on converting renminbi  we are limited in our ability to engage in currency hedging activities in china and do not hedge the renminbi at this time 
with the recent appreciation of the renminbi against the us dollar  during fiscal we experienced a benefit from the positive currency fluctuations  and the financial results of china were favorable 
at the same time  our senior secured bank loan which we intend to service and repay primarily through cash flow from hc s prc operations is denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical ten percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently we believe that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows other than with respect to the renminbi
