this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of our expectations regarding future trends affecting our business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of item a of part i of this form k sets forth certain factors we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
overview we are a medical device company focused on bringing solutions to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists 
as a vertically integrated medical device company  we generate ideas and create new interventional medical devices  and then deliver those products directly to the physician through our direct domestic sales force and international distribution network 
we continue to develop new products and applications for our existing products 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from our statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  revenue product revenue license and collaboration revenue total revenue product costs and operating expenses cost of sales collaboration expenses research and development clinical and regulatory sales and marketing general and administrative thrombin qualification litigation amortization of purchased technology total product costs and operating expenses operating loss interest income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss our primary products are categorized into five product lines 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net revenue by product line along with the percent change from the previous year for years ended december  net revenue percent change net revenue percent change net revenue percent change hemostat products extraction catheters vein products specialty catheters access products other products license collaboration n a total net revenue year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in net revenue was a result of an increased market penetration rate in all our product categories as well as the introduction of new products 
we recognized  of licensing revenue as the result of receiving  from king during as part of the license agreement 
we also recognized  of collaboration revenue as a result of performing clinical and development work for king under the device supply agreement and performing development work for a third party company 
approximately  of our net revenue for the year ended december  was generated from customers in the united states  while  of our net revenue was generated from customers in international markets 
we expect collaboration revenue will continue in as we continue with our pre clinical and clinical work for king 
we also expect to recognize approximately  of license revenue in product gross margin remained at for the year ended december  as the result of a relatively similar product mix and product cost structure as in the year ended december  gross margins vary substantially across our product lines  resulting in variations to our overall product gross margin based on changes in the selling mix of our product lines 
we expect gross margins to be in the range of to in based on our expectation of a similar selling mix of products in compared to collaboration expenses are new to our financial statements and were  for the year ended december  collaboration expenses are the result of our collaboration revenue related to the pre clinical and clinical work we are performing for king 
the expenses also include the product development expenses related to the work done for a third party company 
we expect collaboration expenses to be approximately to of revenue in  depending on the collaboration revenue 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of our continued emphasis on investment in research and development  including an increase to full time employees in research and development at december  compared to at december  we expect our normal research and development expenses to be approximately to of revenue per quarter in as we continue to pursue additional new products at an expected rate of approximately two to four new products per year and we continue to move our longer term development projects forward 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was the increase in the number of full time employees to in clinical  quality and regulatory functions at december  compared to at december  clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical studies 
we expect clinical and regulatory expenses to be approximately of revenue per quarter in sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in sales and marketing expenses was the increase in our direct sales force to employees at the end of compared to as of december  variable compensation including commissions paid to our direct sales force increased by in compared to as sales increased 
we expect to maintain the same relative size of our direct sales force during as a result  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to range from approximately of revenue at the beginning of to between and of revenue by the end of general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of legal fees in the amount of approximately million relating to the diomed  vnus and marine polymer litigation combined  an increase of million from see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately of revenue at the beginning of and decline to approximately to of revenue at the end of the year based on our expectation that legal fees relating to all of the existing litigation will be substantially completed by the end of litigation expense was  for the year ended december  the diomed trial commenced on march  and concluded on march  when the jury reached a verdict that we had contributed to and induced infringement of diomed s patent and awarded monetary damages in the amount of  plus pre judgment interest see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
to settle diomed s claims for pre judgment interest and for additional damages for sales not considered by the jury  we agreed to amend the judgment amount to  and accrued this amount together with additional costs and attorney s fees as of june  in the aggregate amount of  if we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the diomed verdict  we will be required to pay interest on the jury award and the additional damages  therefore we have been expensing the interest as litigation expense as it is incurred 
thrombin qualification project expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  on october   we entered into a supply agreement with sigma aldrich fine chemicals  an operating division of sigma aldrich  inc sigma for the supply of thrombin to us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we have paid for certain development costs of sigma to allow sigma to produce thrombin for our use 
the initial contract term ends after years and is automatically extended for up to five additional successive one year terms unless one party delivers notice of termination at least one year prior to the scheduled termination of the agreement 
during the term of the agreement  sigma has agreed not to sell thrombin of the type developed for us under the agreement in or as a component of a hemostatic product for medical use 
we do not have any minimum purchase requirements under the agreement  however  if we purchase less than three lots of thrombin in any year starting in then sigma will be released from its agreement not to sell thrombin in or as a component of a hemostatic product for medical use  and sigma will have the right to terminate the agreement upon days notice 
the sigma contract was part of our plan to fully qualify a second source of thrombin in addition to the thrombin jmi supply agreement discussed in agreements with king pharmaceuticals  inc above and to bring the new thrombin through the regulatory process to be used in our hemostatic products 
the costs and purchases incurred through december  and the total estimated costs and purchases for the thrombin project including costs and purchases already incurred are as follows incurred as of december  total estimated qualification expenses million million capital equipment purchases million million thrombin inventory purchases net of thrombin expensed million million million million we have purchased million of thrombin from sigma  of which we have expensed approximately  in our development work  resulting in approximately million in inventory at december  this remaining sigma thrombin is expected to be used in our hemostat products sold in international markets 
we expect to receive regulatory approval in early allowing us to use the sigma thrombin in our international hemostat products 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval  we will be unable to use the thrombin in our hemostatic products and we will write off the million of thrombin inventory 
as described in agreements with king pharmaceuticals  inc above  in january we entered into the thrombin jmi supply agreement in the united states with king with a price fixed throughout the year term  adjusted for a producer price index tied to pharmaceuticals 
the thrombin price under the agreement is confidential information  however  the price reflects a discount to the price we paid in the last year of our previous thrombin supply agreement with king 
the thrombin jmi supply agreement does not terminate or affect our ability to complete the qualification of our own second thrombin source  however  with the near term economic need to qualify a second source eliminated  we will be able to evaluate and plan our continuing expenses and steps on this project 
we do not expect to incur any significant thrombin qualification expenses in amortization of purchased technology was during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the amortization resulted from our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc in we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology that was amortized over four years and completed in april interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of higher cash balances due to the million in licensing and milestone payments we received from king in interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as a result of continued payments of principal on our equipment line of credit 
income tax expense was  for the year ended december   primarily the result of federal and state alternative minimum tax amt 
we incurred income tax expense in despite our loss before income taxes of  due to the recognition for tax purposes of the  in milestone and licensing payments from king and the delay in recognition for tax purposes of the  judgment in the diomed litigation pending our appeal 
with the exception of  we have not generated any significant pre tax income in any year and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception in december no provision or benefit for future federal and state income taxes has been recorded for net operating losses incurred in any period since our inception because the benefits may not be realized until and if we generate sustainable taxable income 
we have established a valuation allowance in the amount of the full value of our federal net operating loss  federal and state research and development credits and foreign tax losses 
the adoption of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  has not impacted our operating results since we have historically established a valuation allowance for the full value of our deferred assets 
however  we established a fin reserve of  in as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had a foreign tax loss carryforward of approximately million  which does not expire 
under the united states tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
future use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted due to changes in ownership or from future tax legislation 
we performed a section change in ownership study during the third quarter on our federal net operating loss carryforward  and concluded that  as of the date of this study  we would have no limitations on the net operating loss carryforward 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in net revenue was a result of an increased market penetration rate in all our products categories as well as the introduction of new products 
approximately  of our net revenue for the year ended december  was generated from customers in the united states and  of the net revenue was generated from customers in international markets 
approximately  of our net revenue for the year ended december  was generated from customers in the united states and  of the net revenue was generated from customers in international markets 
product gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from changes in our product selling mix to lower margin products such as our vari lase products from our higher margin d stat dry product 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of our continued emphasis on investment in research and development  including an increase to full time employees in research and development at december  compared to at december   and the addition of stock based compensation expense 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of increasing the number of full time employees to at december  compared to at december  and the addition of stock based compensation expense 
the additional employees were hired principally to manage the additional clinical study activity that commenced in during we conducted the pocket protector clinical study for a new indication of our d stat flowable product and the d stat dry study to obtain clinical data to support growing sales of the d stat dry 
sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in sales and marketing expenses was the increase in our direct sales force to employees at the end of compared to as of december  variable compensation including commissions paid to our direct sales force increased by in compared to as our head count increased and our sales grew 
the addition of stock based compensation expense also resulted in  of sales and marketing expense in general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of higher legal fees relating to the diomed and vnus litigation see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k along with higher business insurance  the addition of stock based compensation expense in  and an increase in the number of general and administrative employees to at december  from at december  thrombin qualification project expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  amortization of purchased technology was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the amortization resulted from our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology and amortized the amount over four years  which was completed in april interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower cash balances maintained during the year 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a result of the borrowings on our equipment line of credit during liquidity and capital resources we have financed substantially all of our operations since inception through the issuance of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our products 
through december   we have sold capital stock generating aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand  of which  is restricted  compared to  in cash and cash equivalents at december  during the year ended december  we added  in cash as a result of operating activities  we incurred net capital expenditures in the amount of  and we generated  in cash from financing activities 
operating cash accumulation was primarily the result of the million we received from king as licensing and milestone payments in addition to cash generated by product sales 
financing activities consisted of  received through the sale of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options  stock warrants and issuances under employee stock plans  reduced by  in debt payments on our million equipment line that was drawn in january capital expenditures included leasehold improvements for our distribution warehouse  manufacturing equipment related to the king agreement and other manufacturing automation equipment 
we have entered into a combined million credit facility with silicon valley bank consisting of a million revolving line of credit with a month term that bears interest at the rate equal to the greater of prime plus or and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets  and a million equipment line of credit with a month term that bears interest at the rate of prime plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets used as collateral for the amounts borrowed on under the equipment line 
the credit facility includes three covenants a minimum of million in tangible net worth  a minimum of million of unrestricted cash in deposit accounts with silicon valley bank and an adjusted net income for each financial reporting period 
the adjusted net income covenant requires an adjusted net income greater than zero for each rolling three month period ending march   an adjusted net income greater than  for each subsequent rolling three month period ending june   and an adjusted net income greater than  for each subsequent rolling three month period thereafter 
the amount required as a minimum tangible net worth will increase by an amount equal to the sum of of the company s quarterly net profit beginning with the quarter ending march  and all consideration received by us upon the issuance of equity securities 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants on december  as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the million revolving line of credit with an availability of million 
as of december   we had a balance of  on the equipment line of credit 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years facility operating leases equipment line of credit total contractual cash obligations this obligation excludes interest 
we do not have any other significant cash commitments related to supply agreements  nor do we have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that we will experience positive cash flow from our normal operating activities for the foreseeable future 
we currently believe that our working capital of million at december  will be sufficient to meet all of our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors  including the outcome of the litigation with vnus medical and marine polymer which are scheduled for trial in june and march  respectively  the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  and other factors 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional funds 
in the event that additional financing is needed  and depending on market conditions  we may seek to raise additional funds for working capital purposes through the sale of equity or debt securities 
there is no assurance such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or available at all 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and that require complex management judgment 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the estimated value of excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value is established by us on a quarterly basis through review of inventory on hand and assessment of future demand  anticipated release of new products into the market  historical experience and product expiration 
our stated value of inventory could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
we have approximately million of sigma thrombin in inventory at december   which we expect to be use in our hemostat products sold in international markets 
we expect to receive regulatory approval in early allowing us to use the sigma thrombin in our international hemostat products 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval  we will be unable to use the thrombin in our hemostatic products and we will write off the million of thrombin inventory 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we recognize revenue as products are shipped based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved and  if approved  customers are subject to a restocking charge 
on january   we entered into three separate agreements with king  consisting of a license agreement  a device supply agreement and a thrombin jmi supply agreement 
we licensed the exclusive rights to our products thrombi pad  thrombi gel and thrombi paste to king for a one time payment of million 
we continue to manufacture the licensed products for sale to king under the device supply agreement 
the device supply agreement requires king to pay us a million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of thrombi gel and again upon the first commercial sale of thrombi paste 
on may  we received the first million payment related to king s first commercial sale of thrombi pad 
we are amortizing the million license fee received on january  and the million milestone payment received on may  on a straight line basis over the remaining years 
we also expect to amortize the second million milestone payment over the remaining year license period from the date it is received 
as part of the device supply agreement  we agreed to conduct clinical studies for the thrombi gel and thrombi paste  with the expected costs related to the clinical studies to be paid by king 
additionally  on may   we entered into a product development supply agreement with a third party company by which we agreed to develop  manufacture and sell to this company a specialty version of our twin pass dual access catheter  with the costs related to the development paid by this company 
we have recognized collaboration revenue on these development agreements as it was earned under the agreements with king and the third party company 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide a warranty for certain products against defects in material and workmanship for periods of up to months 
we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the amount we are charged by our original equipment manufacturer to cover the warranty period 
the original equipment manufacturer includes a one year warranty with each product sold to us 
we record a liability for the uncovered warranty period offered to a customer  provided the warranty period offered exceeds the initial one year warranty period covered by the original equipment manufacturer 
at december   this warranty provision was  compared to  at december  if the assumptions used in calculating the provision were to materially change  resulting in more defects than anticipated  an additional provision may be required 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states and  to a lesser extent  germany  based on estimates and assumptions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million valuation allowance and a  reserve related to our net deferred tax assets of million as a result of our adoption of fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the requirement for a valuation allowance 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r became effective for us on january  for the years ended december  and we recorded  and  of stock based compensation expense 
see the stock based compensation discussion in note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions 
this interpretation prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for any tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
effective january   we adopted fin upon adoption  there was  of unrecognized income tax benefits and the adoption of fin had no effect on shareholders equity 
at december   we have accrued zero for the payment of tax related interest and there was no tax interest or penalties recognized in the statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
we maintain our accounts for cash and cash equivalents principally at one major bank and one investment firm in the united states 
we have a formal written investment policy that restricts the placement of investments to issuers evaluated as creditworthy 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of our cash and cash equivalents 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral 
there have been no material losses on accounts receivables 
in the united states and germany  we sell our products directly to hospitals and clinics in the local currency 
product revenue recognized on sales in germany represented approximately of our total product revenue for the year ended december  any exposure to currency exchange rates on this volume of product sales in germany would be considered immaterial to the financial statements 
in all other international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical clinics 
we sell our product in these countries through independent distributors denominated in united states dollars 
loss  termination or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature 
we had  of indebtedness on our equipment line as of december  if we were to borrow additional amounts from our revolving credit line  we would be further exposed to changes in interest rates 
advances under our revolving and equipment lines of credit bear interest at an annual rate indexed to prime 
we will thus be exposed to interest rate risk with respect to amounts outstanding under these lines of credit to the extent that interest rates rise 
based on our debt outstanding at december   a increase in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately  on an annual basis 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
additionally  we will be exposed to declines in the interest rates paid on deposited funds 
a decline in the current market interest rates paid on deposits would result in interest income being reduced by approximately  on an annual basis
