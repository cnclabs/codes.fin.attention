our gross margin may not be comparable to other specialty retailers  as some companies exclude costs related to their distribution network from cost of goods sold while others  like us  include all or a portion of such costs in cost of goods sold and exclude them from selling  general and administrative expenses

the credit agreement has several borrowing and interest rate options including the following indices i an alternate base rate equal to the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or ii libo rate or iii cdo rate 
advances under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum using the applicable indices plus a varying interest rate margin up to

as of february   there was million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and there was us million outstanding under the canadian term loan 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility were million as of march  
table of contents the credit agreement contains certain restrictive and financial covenants  including the requirement to maintain certain financial ratios 
the restrictive provisions in the credit agreement have been modified to afford us with greater operating flexibility than was provided for in our previous facility and to reflect an overall covenant structure that is generally representative of a commercial loan made to an investment grade company 
our debt  however  is not rated  and we have not sought  and are not seeking  a rating of our debt 
we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement as of february  on october   we issued million of convertible senior notes due notes in a private placement 
interest on the notes was payable semi annually on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the notes were scheduled to mature on october  however  we had the right to redeem the notes between october  and october  if the price of our common stock reached certain levels 
on november   we issued a press release announcing that  as a result of the closing sale price of the company s common stock exceeding of the conversion price for the requisite number of days during the requisite period  we had elected to redeem the full million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
holders of the notes had the right to convert their notes at any time prior to two business days immediately preceding the redemption date 
we had irrevocably elected to settle the principal amount at issuance of the notes in cash when and if surrendered for conversion 
under the terms governing the notes  holders of approximately million principal amount of the notes exercised their conversion right in lieu of having their notes redeemed and we exercised our right to pay cash for the principal amount of the notes converted in lieu of issuing common stock 
the market value of the common stock to be issued upon conversion that exceeded the principal amount was paid by delivering common stock 
as a result  we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the requested conversions 
the remaining million principal amount of the notes was redeemed on december  with such payment and accrued and unpaid interest being made in cash 
notes converted into common stock prior to the redemption date were not entitled to receive accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the conversion and redemption of the notes  we paid approximately million in cash  issued  shares of the company s common stock and wrote off approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs 
we utilize letters of credit primarily for inventory purchases 
at february   letters of credit totaling approximately million were issued and outstanding 
a quarterly cash dividend of per share was paid during each of the quarters ended april   july   october   february  and may  a quarterly cash dividend of per share was paid during each of the quarters ended august   november  and february  cash dividends paid were million for the fiscal year ended february  in january  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of our common stock payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  the dividend payout is approximately million and is included in accrued expenses as of february  on april   we completed the acquisition of after hours  a men s formalwear chain in the united states with stores operating under after hours formalwear and mr 
tux store fronts 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of after hours from federated department stores  inc in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of million  adjusted for certain items  primarily customer cash deposits retained by federated on rentals to be completed after closing 
the total net cash consideration paid after these adjustments and other acquisition costs was approximately million 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under the credit agreement 
we had working capital of million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
historically  our working capital has been at its lowest level in january and february  and has increased through november as inventory buildup occurs in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season 
the million decrease in working capital at february  compared to february  resulted primarily from the acquisition of after hours and purchases of treasury stock 
our operating activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in mainly because cash provided by net earnings  as adjusted for non cash charges  more than offset cash used 
table of contents for increases in inventories and tuxedo rental product and decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
inventories increased in each of the years due mainly to increased selling square footage and  in  an increase of million in corporate uniform product  while tuxedo rental product increased to support the continued growth in our tuxedo rental business and to replenish product 
the decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities relate mainly to the timing of vendor payments 
in  income taxes payable decreased because actual earnings were lower than amounts used to estimate required tax payments 
our investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we made capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and net purchases of short term investments of million in and million in in addition  our acquisition of after hours in used net cash of million

the following table summarizes our share repurchases over the last three fiscal years shares repurchased in thousands total costs in millions average price per share our primary cash requirements are to finance working capital increases as well as to fund capital expenditure requirements which are anticipated to be approximately million for this amount includes the anticipated costs of opening approximately new men s wearhouse stores  new mw tux stores  three new k g stores and one new moores store in at an expected average cost per store of approximately million excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory 
the balance of the capital expenditures for will be used for telecommunications  point of sale and other computer equipment and systems  store relocations  remodeling and expansion and investment in complimentary services and concepts 
the company anticipates that each of the new men s wearhouse stores and each of the three new k g stores will require  on average  an initial inventory costing approximately million and million  respectively subject to the seasonal patterns that affect inventory at all stores  which will be funded by our revolving credit facility  trade credit and cash from operations 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased 
additionally  we may have opportunities to acquire retail chains larger than our past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
we may use cash on hand  together with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of equity securities  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities 
on march   we announced our decision to close our montreal  quebec based manufacturing facility operated by golden brand clothing canada ltd  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
despite previous reductions in production over the last three years  the strengthening canadian dollar and the increasing pace of imports by our competitors have caused us to reach the decision to close the manufacturing facility and to use other alternate production sources 
we expect the closure to occur in or around july we expect the total pre tax charge to be incurred in connection with the closure of the montreal manufacturing facility to be approximately million  which consists primarily of severance payments  the write off of fixed assets  lease termination payments and costs to finalize the clean up and closing of the facility 
we also estimate that approximately million of the charge will result in future cash expenditures 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
as substantially all of our cash is held by two financial institutions  we are exposed to risk of loss in the event of failure of any of these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these two financial institutions  we anticipate full performance and access to our deposits and liquid investments

leases on retail business locations specify minimum base rentals plus common area maintenance charges and possible additional rentals based upon percentages of sales 
most of the retail business location leases provide for renewal options at rates specified in the leases 
our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements

inflation the impact of inflation on the company has been minimal 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  since future events and conditions and their effects 
table of contents cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our critical accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
we believe our critical accounting policies and our most significant estimates are those that relate to inventories and long lived assets  including goodwill  amortization of the cost of our tuxedo rental product  our estimated liabilities for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and employee health benefit costs  our income taxes  and our operating lease accounting 
our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the average cost method for approximately of our inventory and on the retail inventory method for the remaining primarily k g inventories 
our inventory cost also includes estimated buying and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  buying and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of buying and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
we make judgments about the carrying value of long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortizable intangibles  and the recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach at the reporting unit level that requires significant management judgment with respect to sales  gross margin and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge 
the occurrence of an unexpected event or change in circumstances  such as adverse business conditions or other economic factors  would determine the need for impairment testing between annual impairment tests 
our assumptions can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors  such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors  such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
no impairment charges were recorded in and the cost of our tuxedo rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented  which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product 
lost and damaged rental product is also charged to cost of sales 
tuxedo rental product is amortized to expense generally over a two to three year period 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience and information obtained from tuxedo rental industry sources  as to the number of times each unit can be rented 
if the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates  it could materially affect the amount of tuxedo rental product amortization included in cost of sales 
we self insure significant portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors  including industry trends and information provided to us by our insurance broker 
we also use actuarial estimates 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since  in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by 
table of contents various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
our operating leases primarily relate to stores and generally contain rent escalation clauses  rent holidays  contingent rent provisions and occasionally leasehold incentives 
we recognize rent expense for operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which is generally five to ten years based on the initial lease term plus first renewal option periods that are reasonably assured 
the lease terms commence when we take possession with the right to control use of the leased premises and  for stores  is generally days prior to the date rent payments begin 
prior to fiscal  we capitalized rent amounts allocated to the construction period for leased properties as leasehold improvements 
in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp no 
fas fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding fsp 
deferred rent that results from recognition of rent on a straight line basis is included in other liabilities 
landlord incentives received for reimbursement of leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted fin as of the beginning of fiscal year  which resulted in a million increase to our liability for uncertain tax positions 
the increase was recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
in accordance with fin  we classify uncertain tax positions as non current income tax liabilities unless they are expected to be paid within one year and we recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense
