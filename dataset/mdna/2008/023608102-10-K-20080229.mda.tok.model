item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ameren executive summary operations in  we accomplished some key objectives that we believe will bring significant long term benefits to our customers and shareholders 
in illinois  the ameren illinois utilities  genco and aerg reached a comprehensive settlement that will help ameren illinois utilities customers transition to higher electric rates and bring stability to the power procurement process 
rate rollback and freeze legislation in response to higher electric rates in illinois  driven by deregulation of that market  would have had severe negative operational and financial consequences for ameren  cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip  as well as significantly impacted the ameren illinois utilities ability to deliver reliable service to their customers 
major stakeholders involved with this issue  including the illinois governor s office  leaders of the house of representatives and senate in illinois  and the illinois attorney general s office  agreed to the illinois electric settlement agreement 
as a result  the illinois electric settlement agreement provides significantly greater levels of legislative  regulatory and legal certainty 
it also enables a viable competitive power supply market to continue to develop in illinois 
in late  the ameren illinois utilities requested to increase annual revenues for electric and gas delivery services by million in the aggregate 
the ameren illinois utilities also requested icc approval to implement rate adjustment mechanisms for bad debt expenses  certain electric infrastructure investments and the decoupling of natural gas revenues from sales volumes 
the icc has until the end of september to render a decision in these rate cases 
ue also expects to file an electric rate increase request in missouri in the second quarter of to mitigate higher cost and investment levels 
constructive outcomes for the rate cases in illinois and missouri are very important to ue and the ameren illinois utilities 
ue  cips  cilco and ip need to recover their costs to continue investing in their energy infrastructure on a timely basis and provide their customers with safe and reliable service 
in missouri  we were able to settle all state and federal issues associated with the december breach of the upper reservoir at ue s taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility 
ue has begun rebuilding the upper reservoir and expects the plant to be out of service until the fall of  if not longer 
the cost of the rebuild is expected to be in the range of million 
ue believes that substantially all damages and liabilities but not fines and penalties caused by the breach  including costs related to the settlement agreement with the state of missouri  the cost of rebuilding the plant  and the cost or replacement power  up to million annually  will be covered by insurance 
in february  ue filed an integrated resource plan with the mopsc 
the integrated resource plan outlines support for energy efficiency measures to reduce demand growth  expand renewable generation and increase existing power plant efficiency 
some of ue s coal fired power plants are aging  and an analysis will be completed in to determine which units are likely candidates for retirement 
the integrated resource plan concludes that a new baseload plant is expected to be required in our regulated missouri operations in the to timeframe 
for that reason  ue is preserving the option to develop additional nuclear generation  while researching clean coal and carbon sequestration technologies 
ue expects to file in a 
table of contents construction and operating license application with the nrc for a new unit at ue s callaway nuclear plant site 
while this filing will not represent a final decision  it preserves the option to build a nuclear unit 
ue will not proceed on any new baseload power plant unless construction costs are recoverable through rates in missouri 
in addition to considering a new unit at callaway  ue also began the process in to extend through the existing unit license at callaway  which currently expires in in  ameren s non rate regulated generation business segment continued to execute its plan for investing in its power plants to improve their future productivity  as well as to effectively market their generation  consistent with their risk management framework 
non rate regulated generation has also begun significant work on some of its coal fired plants to begin installing additional environmental controls 
earnings ameren reported net income of million  or per share  for compared to net income of million  or per share  in earnings in principally benefited from  among other things  higher priced power sales contracts in ameren s non rate regulated generation business segment  the june implementation of a missouri electric rate order and greater demand for electricity and natural gas caused by warmer summer and cooler winter weather than in ameren s earnings were reduced by cents per share for the net cost of the illinois electric settlement agreement 
storm related costs in reduced net income by cents per share 
the impact of storm restoration efforts was less in  but still significant 
ameren s earnings were reduced by cents per share as a result of the cost of restoration efforts associated with a severe ice storm in january in addition  a ferc order retroactively adjusting prior years rto costs reduced earnings by cents per share 
other items that unfavorably impacted earnings were  among other things  higher fuel costs and bad debt expenses  lower emission allowance sales  increased expenditures to improve reliability in ameren s regulated business segments and higher depreciation and financing costs due to greater energy infrastructure investment 
in addition  there were fewer sales of noncore properties in liquidity cash flows from operations of billion in at ameren  along with other funds  were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of million and to fund capital expenditures of billion 
financing activities in primarily consisted of refinancing debt and funding capital investment with borrowings under credit facilities 
outlook over the next few years  we expect to make significant investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve the reliability of our distribution systems and to comply with environmental regulations 
these investments are consistent with our customers and regulators expectations 
we expect that earnings growth in our rate regulated businesses will come from updating existing customer rates to better reflect these investments and the current levels of costs ue and the ameren illinois utilities are experiencing 
however  in the near term  the returns experienced in and expected to be experienced in by ue and the ameren illinois utilities are below levels allowed by the respective state utility commissions in their last rate cases 
that is due to the fact that ue s and the ameren illinois utilities current rates are significantly below the cost and investment levels they are incurring in their businesses today 
in a rising cost environment  earnings will be negatively impacted due to regulatory lag until appropriate levels of rate relief are granted 
our plan to address this shortfall and to achieve earnings growth is very straightforward ue and the ameren illinois utilities will file more frequent rate cases requesting moderate rate increases  as well as seek appropriate cost recovery mechanisms to mitigate regulatory lag 
in addition  we will continue to optimize ameren s non rate regulated generation s assets  focusing on improving the output of these plants and related energy marketing 
while we currently believe that rising costs  including fuel  depreciation and financing costs will largely offset these productivity gains  we believe our plants will be well positioned for earnings growth in the future should energy and capacity prices improve 
the epa has issued more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants 
between and ameren expects that certain ameren companies will be required to invest between billion and billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment 
costs for these types of projects continue to escalate 
these investments will also result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses 
approximately of this investment will be in ameren s regulated ue operations  and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers 
future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are subject to active consideration in the us congress 
ameren believes that currently proposed legislation can be classified as moderate to extreme depending upon proposed co emission limits  the timing of implementation of those limits  and the method of allocating allowances 
we support public policy that will result in substantial reductions in co emission 
however  co policy must take into account the profound economic implications of moving toward a carbon constrained economy 
we believe any legislation should include the following principles in order to limit the negative impact on our customers  economy and company recognition of the significant economic impact of greenhouse gas policies on consumers and businesses in regions now dependent on coal 
compliance timelines consistent with development of advanced technologies 

table of contents provisions for significant research funding 
provisions for an effective cap and trade program 
allowances for greenhouse gas offsets  such as reforestation 
removal of potential regulatory and financial barriers to improvement in existing infrastructure 
broad based co regulation across all industries 
a national and global policy approach 
future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs 
the costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could be so expensive that ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators may be forced to close some coal fired facilities 
mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on ameren s  ue s  genco s  aerg s and eei s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
the ameren companies will incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability 
expenditures not funded with operating cash flows are expected to be funded primarily with debt

pension and postretirement benefit contributions were million less than in the prior year 
income tax payments increased million  and interest payments increased million because of increased outstanding debt 
cash used for coal purchases increased in to alleviate the coal supply delivery issues experienced in cash used for working capital increased  largely because of storm related costs 
at cips  cash from operating activities decreased from the prior year 
the negative cash effect of higher other operations and maintenance expenses was reduced by a small increase in electric and gas margins  as discussed in results of operations 
income tax payments increased million in compared with reducing this use of cash was a decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions of million in compared with  and an increase in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder december weather and higher gas prices than in the year ago period

an increase in coal deliveries at cilco s subsidiary  aerg  negatively affected cash 
ip s cash from operations increased in  compared with benefiting cash flows were the collection of higher than normal trade receivables caused by cold december weather  as discussed above for ameren  and a million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit payments 
these increases were reduced by lower electric margins and higher other operations and maintenance expenses  including million related to severe storms  net income tax refunds of million in compared with million in  and cash used in for payment of costs  as discussed above for ameren  including an increase of million in other operations and maintenance expenses  and an increase of million in incentive compensation 
pension funding ameren s pension plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and federal funding requirements 
in may  the mopsc issued an electric rate order that allows ue to recover through customer rates the pension expense it incurred under gaap 
consequently  ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the total pension expense 
based on ameren s assumptions at december   and reflecting this pension funding policy  ameren expects to make annual voluntary contributions of million to million in each of the next five years 
we expect ue s  cips  genco s  cilco s  and ip s portion of the future funding requirements to be    and  respectively 
these amounts are estimates  the numbers may change with actual stock market performance  changes in interest rates  any pertinent changes in government regulations  and any voluntary contributions

cash flows from investing activities versus ameren used more cash for investing activities in than in net cash used for capital expenditures increased in as a result of power plant scrubber installation projects  other upgrades at various power plants  and reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution systems  but this increase was reduced by the absence in of ct acquisitions that occurred in the million decrease in of proceeds from sales of noncore properties also increased net cash used in investing activities 
an million decrease in emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows from investing activities  while cash received in for emission allowance sales was million less than in the prior year  because remaining allowances are expected to be retained for environmental compliance needs 
ue s cash used in investing activities decreased in  compared with  principally because of the million expended for ct purchases in that was not spent in otherwise  capital expenditures increased million because of storm repair costs  a power plant scrubber installation project  and other upgrades at various power plants 
other impacts on cash used in investing activities were the absence of sales of noncore properties in compared with a million sale in  and the receipt of million in proceeds from an intercompany note related to the transfer of ue s illinois territory to cips 
additionally  nuclear fuel expenditures increased million in over because of a refueling outage  and sales of emission allowances decreased million because remaining allowances are being retained for environmental compliance needs

the absence in of million of proceeds received in from the sale of leveraged leases  and for cilcorp only the absence in of a note receivable payment from resources company in the amount of million related to the transfer of leveraged leases from cilcorp to resources company  contributed to the increase in cash used in investing activities in the net year over year reduction of million and million in money pool advances for cilco and cilcorp  respectively  and a million reduction of emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows from investing activities in ip s net use of cash in investing activities for was comparable with see note commitments and contingencies to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a further discussion of future environmental capital investment estimates 
versus ameren s increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to ue s purchases of a megawatt ct facility from affiliates of nrg energy inc and megawatt and megawatt ct facilities from subsidiaries of aquila inc  for a total of million  increased nuclear fuel expenditures of million  and million of capital expenditures during related to the severe storms 
the ct purchases were intended to meet ue s increased generating capacity needs and to provide ue with additional flexibility in determining the timing of future baseload generating capacity additions 
emission allowance purchases decreased million in compared with  while emission allowance sales increased million 
the sale of noncore properties in provided a million benefit to ameren s cash from investing activities 
ue s cash used in investing activities decreased in  compared with  principally because of a decrease in capital expenditures at the callaway nuclear plant 
this is due to ue spending million for planned upgrades during a scheduled refueling outage in in addition  in ue received million from cips as repayment of an intercompany note

also negatively affecting cips investing cash flow was an million reduction in proceeds from cips note receivable from genco in in addition  cips paid million to repurchase its own outstanding bond 
the bond remains outstanding  and cips is currently the holder and debtor 
the increased capital expenditures resulted partly from cips expansion of its service territory because of its acquisition of ue s illinois utility operations in may in addition  million was expended as a result of storms 
cips remaining capital expenditures were for projects to improve the reliability of its electric and gas transmission and distribution systems 
genco had a net use of cash in investing activities for  compared with a net source of cash for this was due primarily to the sale of two cts to ue for million 
purchases of emission allowances were million less in than in capital expenditures increased million for compared with cilcorp s cash used in investing activities decreased  and cilco s increased in  compared with capital expenditures increased million for cilcorp and cilco  and net money pool advances decreased for each company by million 
cilcorp s cash from investing activities further benefited from the repayment of resources company s note for million  which originated from the transfer of leveraged leases from cilcorp to resources company 
in addition  a subsidiary of cilcorp and cilco generated cash from investing activities of million in  from the sale of its remaining leveraged lease investments 
emission allowance purchases were million less in than in ip had a net use of cash in investing activities for  compared with a net source of cash for  primarily because of the absence in of the repayments for advances made to the money pool in prior periods 
in addition  capital expenditures increased million over the year ago period  which included million as a result of severe storms  and increased expenditures to maintain the reliability of ip s electric and gas transmission and distribution systems 
intercompany transfer of illinois service territory on may   ue completed the transfer of its illinois based electric and natural gas service territory to cips  at a net book value of million

cips  cilco s  and ip s estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and gas transmission and distribution related activities 
genco s estimated capital expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental regulations and upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities 
cilco aerg s estimate includes capital expenditures primarily for compliance with environmental regulations at aerg s generating facilities  as well as generation related activities 
we continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs 
as a result  we could modify our plan for generation capacity  which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio  the type of generation asset technology that will be employed  and whether capacity or power may be purchased  among other things 
any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred  which could be material 
environmental capital expenditures ameren  ue  genco  aerg and eei will incur significant costs in future years to comply with epa and state regulations regarding so and noxemissions the clean air 
table of contents interstate rule and mercury emissions the clean air mercury rule from coal fired power plants 
in may  the epa issued final regulations with respect to so and nox emissions the clean air interstate rule and mercury emissions the clean air mercury rule from coal fired power plants 
the rules require significant reductions in these emissions from ue  genco  aerg and eei power plants in phases  beginning in states have finalized rules to implement the federal clean air interstate rule and clean air mercury rule 
illinois has finalized rules to implement the federal clean air interstate rule program that will reduce the number of nox allowances automatically allocated to genco s  aerg s and eei s plants 
as a result of the illinois rules  genco  aerg and eei will need to procure allowances and install pollution control equipment 
current plans include the installation of scrubbers for soreduction and selective catalytic reduction scr systems for noxreduction at certain coal fired plants in illinois 
missouri rules  which substantially follow the federal regulations  became effective in april as a result of the missouri rules  ue will manage allowances and install pollution control equipment 
current plans include the installation of scrubbers for so reduction and co benefit reduction of mercury and pollution control equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions at certain coal fired plants in missouri 
illinois has adopted rules for mercury emissions that are significantly stricter than the federal regulations 
in  genco  cilco  eei  and the illinois epa entered into an agreement that was incorporated into illinois mercury emission regulations 
under the regulations  illinois generators may defer until the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by in exchange for accelerated installation of nox and so controls 
in  genco  aerg and eei will begin putting into service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions 
in february  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision that effectively vacated the federal clean air mercury rule 
the court ruled that the epa erred in the method used to remove electric generating units from the list of sources subject to the maximum available control technology requirements under the clean air act 
the court s decision is subject to appeal and it is uncertain how the epa will respond 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact that this action would have on our estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental rules  our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
the table below presents estimated capital costs based on current technology to comply with both the federal clean air interstate rule and clean air mercury rule through and related state implementation plans 
the estimates described below could change  depending upon additional federal or state requirements  new technology  variations in costs of material or labor  or alternative compliance strategies  among other reasons 
the timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with the proposed rules  thereby deferring capital investment 
total ue a genco aerg eei ameren a ue s expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates over time 
illinois and missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet the federal eight hour ozone ambient standard  the federal fine particulate ambient standard  and the clean air visibility rule 
both states have filed ozone attainment plans for the st 
louis area 
the state attainment plans for fine particulate matter must be submitted to the epa by april the plans for the clean air visibility rule were submitted in december the costs in the table above assume that emission controls required for the clean air interstate rule regulations will be sufficient to meet these new standards in the st 
louis region 
should missouri develop an alternative plan to comply with these standards  the cost impact could be material to ue  but we expect these costs to be recoverable from ratepayers 
illinois is planning to impose additional requirements beyond the clean air interstate rule as part of the attainment plans for ozone and fine particulate matter 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact that state actions would have on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
the impact that future initiatives related to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming may have on us is unknown and therefore not included in the estimated environmental expenditures 
although compliance costs are unlikely in the near future  our costs of complying with any mandated federal or state greenhouse gas program could have a material impact on our future results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

cilco s cash used for redemptions  repurchases and maturities of long term debt was comparable in the two years 
these positive effects on cash in were partially offset by the absence in of a million capital contribution received in from ameren  which was made to reduce cilco s short term debt 
also contributing to cilcorp s and cilco s increase in cash used in financing activities for were increased common stock dividends of million at cilcorp and million at cilco

we consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows 
inability to raise capital on favorable terms  particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets  could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses 
after assessing our current operating performance  liquidity  and credit ratings see credit ratings below  we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets 
however  events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited 
such events would increase our cost of capital or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets

credit ratings the following table presents the principal credit ratings of the ameren companies by moody s  s p and fitch effective on the date of this report moody s s p fitch ameren issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb bbb senior unsecured debt baa bb bbb commercial paper p a f ue issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb a secured debt a bbb a commercial paper p a f cips issuer corporate credit rating ba bb bb secured debt baa bbb bbb genco issuer corporate credit rating bbb bbb senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb cilcorp issuer corporate credit rating bb bb senior unsecured debt ba b bb cilco issuer corporate credit rating ba bb bb secured debt baa bbb bbb ip issuer corporate credit rating ba bb bb secured debt baa bbb bbb during march and april of  moody s  s p  and fitch downgraded various credit ratings of certain of the ameren companies 
depending on the specific credit rating agency action and the specific legal entities affected  the downgrade of these credit ratings was a result of the actions of various illinois state legislators  including consideration of forms of legislation that would have rolled back and frozen the electric rates of cips  cilco and ip 
in the case of ue  this downgrade was prompted by higher costs  lower financial metrics  and a continued challenging regulatory environment in missouri 
on june   fitch changed the rating outlook at ue to negative due to the combined effect of the receipt of less than expected rate relief and a sizable capital expenditure program 
on august   fitch changed the rating outlook at ameren to stable 
in addition  fitch revised the rating watch on cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip to positive 
the positive watch followed the announcement of the illinois electric settlement agreement 
see note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report for further discussion of the illinois electric settlement agreement 
on august   s p issued a research update in response to the illinois electric settlement agreement 
the outlook on the ratings of ameren  ue and genco was changed to stable 
the outlook on the ratings of cips  cilcorp  cilco  and ip was upgraded to positive 
on september   s p upgraded its senior secured debt ratings of ue  cips  and cilco from bbb to bbb as a result of changes in its first mortgage bond rating methodology 
on august   moody s changed the rating outlook at ameren and genco to stable 
the rating outlook of cips  cilcorp  cilco  and ip was upgraded to positive 
these actions were prompted by the illinois electric settlement agreement 
moody s stated that the settlement significantly reduces the likelihood of a rate freeze being enacted in illinois and provides the foundation for a potentially improving political and regulatory environment for investor owned utilities in the state 
on february   moody s affirmed the ratings of ameren and genco but changed their rating outlook to negative from stable 
moody s placed the long term credit ratings of ue under review for possible downgrade and affirmed ue s commercial paper rating 
in addition  moody s affirmed the ratings of cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip and maintained a positive rating outlook on these four companies 
according to moody s  the review of ue s ratings was prompted by declining cash flow coverage metrics  increased operating costs  higher capital expenditures for environmental compliance and transmission and distribution system investment  and significant regulatory lag in the recovery of these costs 
moody s stated that the negative outlook on the credit rating of genco reflected genco s position as a predominantly coal generating company that is likely to be seriously affected by more stringent environmental regulations  including a potential cap or tax on carbon emissions 
the negative outlook on the ratings of ameren  according to moody s  reflects the factors that impacted its subsidiaries  ue and genco 
any adverse change in the ameren companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments 
such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel  power and gas supply  among other things  resulting in a negative impact on earnings 
collateral postings and prepayments made as of the end of were million  million  million  million  million  and million at ameren  ue  cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip  respectively  resulting from our reduced issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings 
at december   a reduction to sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings lower than bbb or baa  could have resulted in ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilcorp  cilco or ip being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to million  million  million  million  million  million  and million

outlook below are some key trends that may affect the ameren companies financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity in and beyond 
revenues the earnings of ue  cips  cilco and ip are largely determined by the regulation of their rates by state agencies 
with rising costs  including fuel and related transportation  purchased power  labor  material  depreciation and financing costs coupled with increased capital and operations and maintenance expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and environmental compliance  ameren  ue  cips  cilco and ip expect to experience regulatory lag until requests to increase rates to recover such costs are granted by state regulators 
ameren  ue  cips  cilco and ip expect to be entering a period where more frequent rate cases will be necessary 
ue expects to file its next electric rate case in missouri during the second quarter of the ameren illinois utilities filed delivery service rate cases with the icc in november due to inadequate recovery of costs and low returns on equity of less than experienced in and expected in cips  cilco and ip requested to increase their annual revenues for electric delivery service by million in the aggregate cips million  cilco million  and ip million 
the electric rate increase requests were based on an return on equity  a capital structure composed of to equity  an aggregate rate base for the ameren illinois utilities of billion and a test year ended december   with certain prospective updates 
in addition  cips  cilco and ip filed requests with the icc in november to increase their annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by million in the aggregate cips million increase  cilco million decrease  and ip million increase 
the natural gas rate change requests were based on an return on equity  a capital structure composed of to equity  an aggregate rate base for the ameren illinois utilities of billion and a test year ended december   with certain prospective updates 
the icc has until the end of september to render a decision in these rate cases 
in current and future rate cases  ue  cips  cilco and ip will also seek cost recovery mechanisms from their state regulators to reduce regulatory lag 
in their electric and natural gas delivery service rate cases filed in november  the ameren illinois utilities requested icc approval to implement rate adjustment mechanisms for bad debt expenses  electric infrastructure investments  and the decoupling of natural gas revenues from sales volumes 
in july  a law was enacted that enables the mopsc to put in place fuel and purchased power and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for missouri s utilities 
rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the mopsc in september rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanism were approved by the mopsc in february and will be effective once published in the missouri register 
ue will not be able to use these cost recovery mechanisms until authorized by the mopsc as part of a rate case proceeding 
the mopsc denied ue the use of a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its rate order 
ue plans to request use of a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism and  potentially an environmental cost recovery mechanism  in its next electric rate case filing 
average residential electric rates for cips  cilco and ip increased significantly following the expiration of a rate freeze at the end of electric rates rose because of the increased cost of power purchased on behalf of the ameren illinois utilities customers and an increase in electric delivery service rates 
due to the magnitude of these increases  the illinois electric settlement agreement reached in provides approximately billion over a four year period that began in to fund rate relief for certain electric customers in illinois  including approximately million to customers of the ameren illinois utilities 
funding for the settlement will come from electric generators in illinois and certain illinois electric utilities 
pursuant to the illinois electric settlement agreement  the ameren illinois utilities  genco and aerg agreed to fund an aggregate of million  of which the following contributions remain to be made as of december  cilco illinois cilco ameren cips regulated ip genco aerg a a a total a estimated 
to fund these contributions  the ameren illinois utilities  genco and aerg will need to increase their respective borrowings 
as part of the illinois electric settlement agreement  the reverse auction used for power procurement in illinois was discontinued 
it will be replaced with a new power procurement process to be led by the ipa  beginning in in  utilities will contract for necessary power and energy requirements primarily through a request for proposal process  subject to icc review and 
table of contents approval 
the icc approved the proposed power procurement plans of the ameren illinois utilities in december existing supply contracts from the september reverse auction remain in place 
the ameren illinois utilities power procurement costs are passed directly to its customers 
the impact of the new procurement process in illinois is uncertain 
also as part of the illinois electric settlement agreement  the ameren illinois utilities entered into financial contracts with marketing company for the benefit of genco and aerg  to lock in energy prices for to  megawatts annually of their around the clock power requirements during the period june  to december   at then relevant market prices 
these financial contracts do not include capacity  are not load following products and do not involve the physical delivery of energy 
the mopsc issued an order  as clarified  granting ue a million increase in base rates for electric service with new electric rates effective june  this order included provisions to extend ue s callaway nuclear plant and fossil generation plant lives and to change the income tax method associated with the cost of property removals 
such provisions are expected to decrease ameren s and ue s expenses by million annually 
the mopsc also approved a stipulation and agreement authorizing an increase in ue s annual natural gas delivery revenues of million  effective april  ue agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before march  volatile power prices in the midwest affect the amount of revenues ameren  ue  genco  cilco through aerg and eei can generate by marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets and influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets 
the availability and performance of ue s  genco s  aerg s and eei s electric generation fleet can materially impact their revenues 
genco and aerg are seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their power plants over the long term through greater investments and a process improvement program 
the non rate regulated generation segment expects to generate million megawatthours of power in genco million  aerg million  eei million  million megawatthours in genco million  aerg million  eei million and million megawatthours in genco million  aerg million  eei million 
all but million megawatthours of genco and aerg s pre wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements expired during in  million megawatthours of these agreements  which had an average embedded selling price of per megawatthour  expired 
another million contracted megawatthours will expire in late  which have an average embedded selling price of per megawatthour 
these agreements are being replaced with market based sales 
the marketing strategy for non rate regulated generation is to optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility  while capitalizing on its low cost generation fleet to provide solid  sustainable returns 
through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts  including contracts resulting from the illinois power procurement auction and the illinois electric settlement agreement  marketing company sold as of december   approximately of non rate regulated generation s expected generation at an average price of per megawatthour fiscal year  at an average price of per megawatthour  fiscal year  at an average price of per megawatthour 
the future development of ancillary services and capacity markets in miso could increase the electric margins of ue  genco  aerg and eei 
ancillary services are services necessary to support the transmission of energy from generation resources to loads while maintaining reliable operation of the transmission provider s system 
in february  ferc conditionally accepted the ancillary services market tariff proposed by miso 
we expect non rate regulated generation s ancillary services market revenues to increase to million in from million realized in ancillary services market revenues are allocated to genco and aerg based on their generation in accordance with their power supply agreements with marketing company 
we expect miso will begin development of a capacity market once its ancillary services market is in place 
a capacity market allows participants to purchase or sell capacity products that meet reliability requirements 
miso is currently in the process of developing a centralized regional wholesale ancillary services market  which is expected to begin during we expect capacity and energy prices to strengthen from current levels because of improving market liquidity and decreasing reserve margins in miso 
non rate regulated generation s capacity revenues are expected to increase to approximately million in from million in eei receives payment for of its capacity sales under its power supply agreement with marketing company 
capacity revenues are allocated to genco and aerg based on their generation in accordance with their power supply agreements with marketing company 
we expect continued economic growth in our service territory and market area to benefit energy demand in and beyond  but higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from customers  especially in illinois 
future energy efficiency programs developed by ue  cips  cilco and ip and others could also result in reduced demand for our electric generation and our electric and gas transmission and distribution services 
fuel and purchased power in  of ameren s electric generation ue  genco  aerg  eei was supplied by coal fired power plants 
about of the coal used by these plants ue  genco  
table of contents aerg  eei was delivered by railroads from the powder river basin in wyoming 
in the past  deliveries from the powder river basin have been restricted because of rail maintenance  weather  and derailments 
as of december   coal inventories for ue  genco  aerg and eei were adequate  and in excess of historical levels  but below targeted levels 
disruptions in coal deliveries could cause ue  genco  aerg and eei to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods  buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity  and purchasing power from other sources 
ameren s fuel costs including transportation are expected to increase in and beyond 
fuel costs for both missouri regulated and non rate regulated generation are expected to increase approximately from to as of december   approximately  and of missouri regulated s estimated fuel costs for  and  respectively  were priced hedged 
approximately  and of non rate regulated generation s estimated fuel costs for  and  respectively  were price hedged 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for through other costs in december  there was a breach of the upper reservoir at ue s taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility 
this resulted in significant flooding in the local area  which damaged a state park 
in january  the circuit court of reynolds county  missouri  approved ue s november settlement agreement with the state of missouri resolving the state s lawsuit and claims for damages and other relief related to the breach 
in addition  pursuant to the settlement agreement  ue is required to replace the breached upper reservoir with a new reservoir  subject to ferc authorization 
ue received approval from ferc to rebuild the upper reservoir in august and hired a contractor in november the estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir is in the range of million 
ue expects the taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility to be out of service through at least the fall of  if not longer 
ue believes that substantially all of the damages and liabilities caused by the breach  including costs related to the settlement agreement with the state of missouri  the cost of rebuilding the plant  and the cost of replacement power  up to million annually  will be covered by insurance 
insurance will not cover lost electric margins and penalties paid to ferc 
under ue s insurance policies  all claims by or against ue are subject to review by its insurance carriers 
as a result of this breach  ue is engaged in litigation initiated by certain private parties 
we are unable to predict the timing  or outcomes of this litigation  or its possible effect on ue s results of operation  financial position or liquidity 
see note rate and regulatory matters and note commitments and contingencies to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a further discussion of taum sauk matters 
ue s callaway nuclear plant s next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in the fall of is expected to last to days 
during a scheduled outage  which occurs every months  maintenance and purchased power costs increase  and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases  versus non outage years 
over the next few years  we expect rising employee benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures we have taken  or may need to take  at ue s callaway nuclear plant and at our other facilities 
insurance premiums may also increase as a result of the taum sauk incident  among other things 
bad debts may increase due to rising electric and gas rates 
as we refinance our short term and variable rate debt into fixed rate debt  financing costs may increase 
we are currently undertaking cost reduction and control initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of all aspects of our business 
capital expenditures the epa has issued more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants 
between and  ameren expects that certain ameren companies will be required to invest between billion and billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment 
costs for these types of projects continue to escalate 
these investments will also result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses 
approximately of this investment will be in ameren s regulated ue operations  and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers 
the recoverability of amounts expended in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for generators 
future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs 
excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities 
in december  ameren issued a report on how it is responding to the rising regulatory  competitive  and public pressure to significantly reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions from current and proposed power plant operations 
the report included ameren s climate change strategy and activities  current greenhouse gas emissions  and analysis with respect to plausible future greenhouse gas scenarios  it is available on ameren s 
table of contents web site 
investments to control carbon emissions at ameren s coal fired plants would significantly increase future capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses 
ue continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity 
at this time  ue does not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until to however  due to the significant time required to plan  acquire permits for  and build a baseload power plant  ue is actively studying future plant alternatives  including those that would use coal or nuclear fuel 
in  ue signed an agreement with unistar nuclear to assist ue in the preparation of a combined construction and operating license application cola for filing with the nrc 
a cola describes how a nuclear plant would be designed  constructed and operated 
in addition  ue has also signed contracts for certain long lead time equipment 
preparing that cola and entering into these contracts does not mean a decision has been made to build a nuclear plant 
these are only the first steps in the regulatory licensing and procurement process 
ue and unistar nuclear must submit the cola to the nrc in to be eligible for incentives available under provisions of the energy policy act 
we cannot predict whether or when the nrc will approve the cola 
ue intends to submit a license extension application with the nrc to extend its callaway nuclear plant s operating license by twenty years so that the operating license will expire in ue cannot predict whether or when the nrc will approve the license extension 
over the next few years  we expect to make significant investments in our electric and gas infrastructure and to incur increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall system reliability 
we are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures 
ue announced in july plans to spend million over three years for underground cabling and reliability improvement  million million per year for tree trimming  and million over three years approximately million per year for circuit and device inspection and repair 
we would expect these costs or investments to be ultimately recovered in rates 
increased investments for environmental compliance  reliability improvement  and new baseload capacity will result in higher depreciation and financing costs 
the ameren companies will incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years for compliance with environmental regulations and to make significant investments in their electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability 
expenditures are expected to be funded primarily with debt 
other as required by the mopsc  ue filed a study in november with the mopsc evaluating the costs and benefits of ue s participation in miso 
this case is currently pending 
ue s filing noted that there were a number of uncertainties associated with the cost benefit study  including issues associated with the ue miso service agreement 
if some of these uncertainties are ultimately resolved in a manner adverse to ue  it could call into question whether it is cost effective for ue to remain in miso 
ue has advised miso of its intent to withdraw from miso as of december   in order to preserve the option to withdraw based on the outcome of the pending mopsc proceeding 
it is uncertain when or how the mopsc will rule on ue s miso cost benefit study or  if ue were to withdraw from miso  what the effect of such a withdrawal would be on ue 
the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
these strategies may include acquisitions  divestitures  opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues  and other strategic initiatives to increase ameren s shareholder value 
we are unable to predict which  if any  of these initiatives will be executed 
the execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

effects of inflation and changing prices our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the mopsc and the icc 
nonretail electric rates are regulated by ferc 
adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period 
as a result  revenue increases will lag behind changing prices 
inflation affects our operations  earnings  stockholders equity  and financial performance 
the current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost 
under existing regulatory practice  only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers 
as a result  cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years 
our non rate regulated generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms 
in ue s missouri electric utility jurisdiction  there is currently no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power 
however  in july  a law was enacted that enables the mopsc to put in place cost recovery mechanisms for fuel and purchased power and for environmental costs at missouri s utilities 
rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the mopsc in september rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanism were approved by the mopsc in february and will be effective once published in the missouri register 
ue will not be able to use these cost recovery mechanisms until so authorized by the mopsc as part of a rate case proceeding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument  derivative or nonderivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on  or derived from  the value of some underlying asset 
the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we handle market risks in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks  principally business  legal and operational risks  are not part of the following discussion 
our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters 
our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee  which is composed of senior level ameren officers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with long term and short term variable rate debt  fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and auction rate long term debt 
we manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by on variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest expense net income a ameren ue cips genco b cilcorp cilco ip a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b less than million 
the estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 
insured tax exempt auction rate bonds our tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue auction rate bonds issued for the benefit of ue  cips  cilco and ip through governmental authorities are insured by monoline bond insurers 
see note long term debt and equity financings to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a description and details of the tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds issued for the benefit of ue  cips  cilco and ip 
monoline bond insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when an issuer defaults  as a result  such securities typically receive the highest investment grade ratings from the credit rating agencies  which reflect the credit ratings of the monoline bond insurers 
ue has an aggregate of million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds million insured by xl capital ltd  million insured by mbia inc 
cips has million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction 
table of contents rate bonds insured by xl capital ltd 
cilco has million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds insured by financial guaranty insurance company 
ip has an aggregate of million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds million insured by mbia inc  million insured by ambac financial group  inc 
our insured tax exempt auction rate bonds bear interest at rates determined pursuant to auctions conducted every seven or days  depending on the particular series of securities 
as a result of developments in the capital markets with respect to residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  the credit rating agencies have placed some of the monoline bond insurers on review for a possible downgrade or have actually downgraded their credit ratings due to their insuring of such securities 
as a result  since december  the insured tax exempt bonds that are guaranteed by the monoline bond insurers have similarly been placed on review for possible downgrade or have been downgraded 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
it should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization 
as a result of these actions by the credit rating agencies with respect to monoline bond insurers and a lack of liquidity in the auction rate market  we believe the interest rates on certain of our insured tax exempt auction rate bonds are higher than they would have been in the absence of such actions 
it is possible that the credit rating agencies may continue to take steps to further downgrade the credit ratings of the monoline bond insurers as well as our tax exempt bonds insured by such insurers and any such further negative actions could result in higher interest rates on our insured tax exempt auction rate bonds 
downgrades of the monoline bond insurers also increase the possibility of a failed auction  where there are not sufficient clearing bids in an auction to set the interest rate 
a failed auction would result in the interest rates resetting to maximum interest rates ranging up to  depending upon the series of bonds  until the next scheduled auction date at which time another attempt at a successful auction will be made 
between february and  we experienced failed auctions with respect to a portion of our tax exempt auction rate bonds 
according to press reports  many other series of tax exempt auction rate securities similarly experienced failed auctions 
we are evaluating various options available to us  including refinancing with other instruments  to mitigate the effects of the ratings downgrades on the monoline insurers and the effects of these on the interest rates of our securities 
certain of these options would require approvals from state regulators and could result in higher expense 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
nymex traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the nymex and have nominal credit risk 
in all other transactions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction 
our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures 
the risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base 
at december   no nonaffiliated customer represented more than  in the aggregate  of our accounts receivable 
our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in missouri and illinois 
ue  cips  genco  aerg  ip  afs  and marketing company may have credit exposure associated with interchange or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies 
at december   ue s  cips  genco s  cilco s  ip s  afs  and marketing company s combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated non investment grade trading counterparties related to interchange or wholesale purchases and sales was less than million  net of collateral less than million 
we establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management  master trading and netting agreements  and credit support  such as letters of credit and parental guarantees 
we also analyze each counterparty s financial condition before we enter into sales  forwards  swaps  futures or option contracts  and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases 
we estimate our credit exposure to miso associated with the miso day two energy market to be million at december  million 
the ameren illinois utilities will be exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the parties contributing to the illinois comprehensive rate relief and assistance programs under the illinois electric settlement agreement  which will provide million in rate relief over a four year period to certain electric customers of the ameren illinois utilities 
under funding agreements among the parties contributing to the rate relief and assistance programs  at the end of each month  the ameren illinois utilities bill the participating generators for their proportionate share of that month s rate relief and assistance  which is due in days  or drawn from the funds provided by the generators escrow 
see note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report for additional information 
equity price risk our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  including the rate of return on plan assets 
ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in erisa 
ameren s goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk 
ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class 

table of contents where appropriate  ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types 
ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines 
the expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio 
assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience  future expectations  and the volatility of the various asset classes 
after considering the target asset allocation for each asset class  we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets 
in future years  the costs of such plans reflected in net income or oci and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially  without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 
ue also maintains a trust fund  as required by the nrc and missouri law  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities and debt securities and totaled million in million 
by maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments  ue seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk 
however  the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
the fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ue actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options 
ue s exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated  because ue is currently allowed to recover through electric rates its decommissioning costs  which would include unfavorable investment results 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity  fuel  and natural gas 
ue s  genco s  aerg s and eei s risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements 
genco  aerg and eei also seek to sell power forward to wholesale  municipal and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices 
we also attempt to mitigate financial risks through structured risk management programs and policies  which include structured forward hedging programs  and the use of derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts  and financial swap contracts 
however  a portion of the generation capacity of ue  genco  aerg and eei is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices 
the following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by on unhedged economic generation for through net income a ameren ue genco cilco aerg eei a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns 
due to our physical presence in the market  we are able to identify and pursue opportunities which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities 
all of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process 
we establish value at risk var and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any negative material financial impact 
similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation 
most ue  genco and aerg fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts 
ue  genco and aerg do not have a provision similar to the pga clause for electric operations  so ue  genco and aerg have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel to manage their exposure to fuel prices 
the coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility 
price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures  whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year 
we generally purchase coal up to five years in advance  but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions 
the strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions 
transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs 
we typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility 
natural gas transportation expenses for ameren s gas distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units of ue  genco  aerg and eei are regulated by ferc through approved tariffs governing the rates  terms and conditions of transportation and storage services 
certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by ameren companies include rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the primary term 
depending on our competitive position  we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements 

table of contents the following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants  nuclear fuel for ue s callaway nuclear plant  natural gas for our cts and retail distribution  as appropriate  and purchased power needs of cips  cilco and ip  which own no generation  that are price hedged over the five year period through  as of december  ameren coal coal transportation nuclear fuel natural gas for generation natural gas for distribution a purchased power for illinois regulated b ue coal coal transportation nuclear fuel natural gas for generation natural gas for distribution a cips natural gas for distribution a purchased power b genco coal coal transportation natural gas for generation cilcorp cilco coal aerg coal transportation aerg natural gas for distribution a purchased power b ip natural gas for distribution a purchased power b eei coal coal transportation a represents the percentage of natural gas price hedged for peak winter season of november through march

nearly all of these customers chose a third party supplier 
also excluded from the percent hedged amount is purchased power to serve large service real time pricing customers  which is purchased as needed 
see note rate and regulatory matters and note commitments and contingencies to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a discussion of this matter and the new power procurement process pursuant to the illinois electric settlement agreement 

table of contents the following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period through in addition  coal and coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges 
if diesel fuel costs were to increase by gallon  ameren s fuel expense could increase by million annually ue million  genco million  aerg million and eei million 
as of december   ameren has price hedged approximately of expected fuel surcharges in coal transportation fuel net fuel net expense income a expense income a ameren b ue genco cilcorp cilco eei a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries 
in the event of a significant change in coal prices  ue  genco and cilco would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources 
with regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel  ue has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements  or it uses inventories that provide some price hedge to fulfill its callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium  conversion  enrichment  and fabrication services through there is no fuel reloading scheduled for ue has price hedges for of the to nuclear fuel requirements 
the nuclear fuel markets have undergone significant change 
what was once a buyer s market has become a seller s market  with increased potential for supply disruptions 
ue has increased its desired inventories of nuclear fuel with inherent price hedge and has increased its forward contract coverage 
new long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor 
new long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component 
therefore  nuclear fuel price increases are expected  and price hedging becomes less available 
ue expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the callaway nuclear plant  at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted 
unlike the electricity and natural gas markets  nuclear fuel markets have no sophisticated financial instruments available for price hedging  so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts  if they are available 
with regard to the electric generating operations for ue  genco and aerg that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run cts  the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs 
we optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins 
through the market allocation process  ue  cips  genco  cilco and ip have been granted ftrs associated with the advent of the miso day two energy market 
marketing company has acquired ftrs for its participation in the pjm northern illinois market 
the ftrs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to our physical electricity business 
depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid  ftrs could result in either charges or credits 
we use complex grid modeling tools to determine which ftrs we wish to nominate in the ftr allocation process 
there is a risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of ftrs we will need  and there is the potential that the ftrs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges 
with regard to ue s natural gas distribution business and cips  cilco s and ip s power and natural gas distribution businesses  exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place 
these cost recovery mechanisms allow ue  cips  cilco and ip to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs 
our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers 
we cannot eliminate the effects of price volatility 
however  procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier  as well as the management of physical assets 
with regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities  ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability 
see supply for electric power under part i  item  of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal  nuclear  natural gas  hydroelectric and oil 
also see note commitments and contingencies to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for further information 
fair value of contracts most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales 
we use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas  fuel  electricity and emission allowances 
price fluctuations in natural gas  fuel  electricity and emission allowances may cause any of these conditions an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when 
table of contents purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices  market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under contracted commitment  or actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays 
the derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts  futures  options and swaps 
our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required 
the goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements 
see note derivative financial instruments to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for further information
