table of contents overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that applies proprietary technologies to develop new products and improved formulations of existing drugs that target current unmet and underserved medical needs primarily in the pain management market 
our product candidates are designed to offer enhanced pain relief  fewer adverse side effects and faster relief of pain compared to other currently available treatments 
we have three late stage product candidates in clinical development in the united states dyloject diclofenac sodium injectable  pmi intranasal ketamine and rylomine intranasal morphine 
on october   we received marketing authorization approval in the united kingdom uk for dyloject  our proprietary injectable formulation of diclofenac sodium mg ml 
commercial launch of the product occurred in december of upon first inclusion in local hospital formularies 
product revenues related to dyloject are expected to occur in we have devoted substantially all of our resources since we began our operations in february to the development of proprietary pharmaceutical products for the treatment of pain 
we have not generated any revenues from product sales 
since our inception  we have incurred an accumulated net loss attributable to our common stockholders of approximately million through december   excluding approximately million of a deemed dividend 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  including acquisition of technology rights  general and administrative expenses  and most recently  sales and marketing expenses 
research and development activities include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for our research  development and manufacturing employees  costs associated with nonclinical and clinical trials  process development and improvement  and clinical and commercial scale manufacturing 
selling  general and administrative costs include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for employees  temporary and consulting expenses  and costs associated with our post launch selling and marketing activities in the uk on september   we completed a merger with intrac  inc intrac  a nevada corporation  for the purpose of migrating the intrac corporate entity to delaware  at which time javelin pharmaceuticals  inc javelin continued the business conducted by intrac 
javelin was incorporated in july in the state of delaware by intrac 
on december   we completed a reverse merger transaction with innovative drug delivery systems  inc idds  whereby intrac merger sub  inc  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of intrac merged with and into idds  with idds as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of intrac 
in consideration for their shares of idds  the former stockholders of idds received approximately of the outstanding common stock of intrac 
following the merger  the executive officers and directors of idds became the executive officers and directors of intrac 
for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition with idds as the acquiror and intrac as the acquired party 
therefore  when we refer to our business and financial information relating to periods prior to the merger  we are referring to the business and financial information of idds 
the merger did not have any significant effects on our assets or liabilities or on our results of operations subsequent to the date of the merger 
since our inception  we have incurred approximately million of research and development costs 
the major research projects undertaken by us include the development of dyloject  pmi and rylomine 
total research and development costs incurred to date for each of these products was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of research and development costs since inception that do not relate to our major research projects  and we incurred a charge of approximately million related to the merger of idds with pain management  inc and the related acquisition of a licensing agreement in for various reasons  many of which are outside our control  including timing and results of our clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval and our dependence on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred to commercialize our products  nor is it possible to estimate when  if ever  any of our products will be approved by regulatory agencies for commercial sale 
in addition  we may experience adverse results in the development of our products  which could result in significant delays in obtaining approval to sell our products  additional costs to be incurred to obtain regulatory approval or failure to obtain regulatory approval 
if any of our product candidates were to experience setbacks  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
even if we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of one or more of 
table of contents our products  failure of physicians and patients to accept our products as a safe  cost effective alternative compared to existing products would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
we have limited capital resources  significant net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expect these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  it is anticipated that we likely will not generate significant revenues from product sales during the year ending december  although we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to support the current operating plan at least through september   we will need additional financing to support our operating plan thereafter or we will need to modify our operating plan accordingly 
we may raise additional funds through the private and or public sale of our equity and or debt securities 
we may also seek to raise capital through collaborative arrangements with corporate sources or other sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if at all available  can be obtained on terms reasonable to us 
if sufficient funds are not available  we will need to postpone or discontinue future planned operations and projects 
results of operations revenues 
with the exception of revenues derived from government grants and contracts  we have generated no operating revenues since our inception 
however  we do expect to generate product revenues in from sales of our lead product dyloject primarily in the uk product revenues from dyloject in and beyond will be contingent upon successfully completing the uk hospital formulary approval process with advantageous pricing  our ability to file additional marketing applications through the mutual recognition process in a number of european union eu member countries  regulatory approval of those applications  our ability to achieve favorable pricing in member countries  our ability to market dyloject effectively  and market acceptance of dyloject 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when such applications in the remaining european countries will be approved 
in october  we received a grant of million from the us department of defense dod 
in may  the dod extended funding of the development of pmi by awarding us a million contract 
the dod reimburses us for certain research and development costs related to the pmi development program which can fluctuate from period to period 
the dod contract was the sole source of contract and grant revenue 
the dod contract is billed monthly as costs are incurred 
we did not record any contract revenue for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  during  the dod contract was the sole source of contract revenue 
as of december   we had no additional funds available for reimbursement from the dod grant  nor did we enter into any new grants in the decrease is attributable to decreased activity associated with expenditures billable to the dod contract 
contract revenue decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  during  the dod contract was the sole source of contract revenue

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials and supplies used to develop and manufacture our product candidates 
other research and development expenses include compensation paid to consultants and outside service providers to run the clinical trials 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant research and development expenses in the future as our three product candidates proceed with pivotal clinical trials and progress through the later stages of product development towards commercialization 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and nature of clinical trial expenditures and regulatory filings 

table of contents research and development expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses resulted from the advancement of each of our three product candidate development programs 
research and development salaries  temporary labor  and benefits increased by approximately million as compared to the same period of the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of full time personnel and recording stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r

milestone expenses were  for the year ended december  there were no milestone expenses for the year ended december  dyloject product development costs increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in july  we began the second of two pivotal us phase clinical studies for dyloject 
this us study is enrolling patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain following elective orthopedic surgery 
this is a arm design that employs dyloject and ketorolac doses  or placebo  in postoperative orthopedic surgical patients 
in december  dyloject successfully met primary and secondary analgesic efficacy endpoints in the first of two pivotal us phase studies 
in this us multi center study  postoperative lower abdominal surgery patients with moderate to severe pain were randomized to receive certain dosage levels of dyloject  ketorolac or placebo iv every six hours 
additionally  in january  we announced results of a new phase study of dyloject demonstrating minimal effects upon platelet function at a clinically effective dose 
in contrast  aspirin and ketorolac each impaired platelet aggregation significantly 
pmi product development costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  by year end we had three of our planned phase trials needed to complete the clinical portion of our nda filing for pmi fully accrued 
in july  we began dosing the first patient in a phase clinical study of pmi in a trial that is expected to enroll up to patients and is designed to extend published observations by us in a pilot study of pmi in treating breakthrough pain 
additionally  we are now planning a postoperative  multi dose  acute pain study in same day orthopedic surgery 
this additional pre submission study will extend the timeline and cost for filing our initial nda 
rylomine product development costs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in june  rylomine successfully met its primary clinical endpoint  in this first of two pivotal phase studies  as patients with moderate to severe pain after elective orthopedic surgery had significantly better summary of pain intensity differences scores over hours than the corresponding placebo groups 
this study  termed mor  involved randomized patients with moderate to severe post surgical pain enrolled at seven sites in the united states

regulatory expenses were associated primarily with the preparation for future fda regulatory meetings 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  sales and marketing and human resource functions 
other costs include promotional costs  medical education and other marketing costs associated with the launch of a product  as well as facility costs and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase primarily as a result of increased sales and marketing costs associated with the launch of dyloject in the uk  and as we expand and improve our administrative infrastructure 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  salary  stock based compensation and benefits expense increased by approximately million due to an increase in full time headcount and stock based compensation in accordance with of sfas r

interest income 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities available for sale 
interest income increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  due to higher average invested balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in interest income increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  due to higher average invested balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in interest expense 
interest expense historically has consisted of interest incurred on loans 
there was no significant interest expense for the years ended december   and other income 
in february  we settled litigation with west pharmaceutical services  inc west regarding west s assignment of certain license agreements to archimedes pharma limited archimedes as part of the sale of west s drug delivery business to archimedes 
under the terms of the settlement  on march  west paid us approximately  to resolve all claims and we exchanged mutual releases 
the amount received from west in is included in other income for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the private placement of our equity securities  debt financings and grant revenue primarily from the us department of defense 
we may raise additional funds through the private and or public sale of our equity and or debt securities 
we may also seek to raise capital through collaborative arrangements with corporate sources or other sources of financing 
we intend to continue to use the proceeds from these sources to fund ongoing research and development activities  activities related to potential future commercialization  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general purposes 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  compared to million as of december  on february  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec  which was declared effective by the sec on february   pursuant to which we sold in may an aggregate of  shares of common stock  which consisted of  shares in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share  and  shares purchased by our underwriters at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the sale of the common stock under the offering were approximately million  net of approximately million for underwriting fees and million of additional offering expenses 
on november  we closed a private placement consisting of the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock and  warrants for net proceeds of approximately million 
in december  we raised approximately million through the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock at per share in a private placement 
although we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to support the current operating plan at least through september   we will need additional financing to support our operating plan thereafter or we will need to modify our operating plan accordingly 
we may raise additional funds through the private and or public sale of our equity and or debt securities 
we may need to raise additional funds to meet long term planned goals 
on february   we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s under the securities act  which became effective on february  this registration statement allows us  from time to time  to offer and sell any combination of shares of common stock and or preferred stock  various series of debt securities  and or warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units comprised of any of such securities  but not to exceed million 
to date  we have not issued any additional securities or warrants under this registration 
table of contents statement 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if at all available  can be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain such additional financing  future operations will need to be scaled back or discontinued 
as a development stage enterprise  our primary efforts  to date  have been devoted to conducting research and development  raising capital  forming collaborations and recruiting staff 
we have limited capital resources and revenues  have experienced a million net loss attributable to our common stockholders and have had negative cash flows from operations since inception 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  including acquisition of technology rights  increasing costs related to potential future commercialization of our product candidates  and general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we have paid an aggregate of million and million in cash since inception to west pharmaceutical and shimoda biotech proprietary ltd  respectively  pursuant to agreements that we have entered into with these entities 
we expect to incur additional operating losses until such time as we generate sufficient revenue to offset expenses  and we may never achieve profitable operations 
we expect our cash requirements for operating activities will increase due to the following future activities conducting commercialization activities in support of dyloject product launch  including pre launch planning  development of market plans  production of commercial stock  pricing and reimbursement application  development of regional sales and marketing capabilities  conducting remaining nonclinical programs  including carcinogenicity studies to support both pmi and rylomine regulatory submission and label extensions  conducting clinical programs  including phase i and phase clinical trials to support regulatory submissions and label extensions of our product candidates  continuing to support good manufacturing practices gmp drug supply requirements of our nonclinical and clinical trials  completing formal stability testing  analytical development  methods development  specification development and commercial scale up  maintaining  protecting and expanding our intellectual property  developing expanded internal infrastructure  and hiring additional personnel

net cash used in operating activities increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  consists primarily of our net loss of million 
the increase in net cash used for operating activities was due primarily to higher cash outflows associated with an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development activity in significant increases were directly related to salaries  benefits and infrastructure costs related to the addition of several new personnel  advancing our research and development clinical trials for each of our product candidates  and increased pre and post launch planning and development costs associated with commercialization of dyloject 
operating cash flows differ from net income as a result of non cash charges or changes in working capital  primarily our non cash stock based compensation expenses of approximately million

in compliance with our policy  the milestone has been recorded as an intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheet as it relates to a commercialized product with future economic benefit  and is being amortized over the remaining life of the patents approximately years 
this was offset by a decrease of million of cash used in net purchases of short term marketable securities compared to from inception to december   capital expenditures have not been material resulting from our use of contract manufacturing facilities and leased office space

under the license agreement with shimoda biotech  ltd 
we are obligated to make aggregate remaining milestone payments of approximately million upon the occurrence of specified developmental milestones  which include the filing of an nda with the fda for dyloject  the approval of an nda by the fda and the first commercial sale of a licensed product and pay a royalty based upon our and our sublicensees sales of products  which is subject to change  as noted 
under the license agreements with archimedes pharma limited assigned from west pharmaceutical services  inc  we may be required to pay an aggregate of million for research and development milestones if certain defined events occur  which include the first filing of a marketing authorization application with a regulatory agency  first approval of a marketing authorization application and the first commercial sale of a licensed product  which is subject to change  as noted 
the timing of the remaining milestones is dependent upon factors that are beyond our control  including our ability to recruit patients  the outcome of future clinical trials and any requirements imposed on our clinical trials by regulatory agencies 
however  for the purpose of the above table  we have assumed that the payment of the milestones will occur between one to three years  from december  under our commercial supply agreement with precision pharma services  inc  we committed to purchase at least  worth of product during the two year period beginning on april  under our manufacturing agreement with baxter healthcare corporation baxter  we committed to purchase at least  worth of dyloject product manufactured to our specifications  commencing upon regulatory approval from the fda 
as is customary in such agreements  either party may terminate upon written notice upon the occurrence of certain events  including breach  bankruptcy  insolvency or  subject to certain cure provisions and restrictions  including the lack of fda approval for dyloject by a specified date for baxter 
purchase commitments in february  we entered into a commercial supply agreement the supply agreement with precision pharma services  inc precision 
the initial term of the supply agreement is two years  and it is renewable in one year increments 
under the supply agreement  precision agreed to manufacture our requirements for the supply of dyloject  in accordance with us and us good manufacturing practices 
we committed to purchase at least  worth of product during the two year period beginning on april  either party may terminate the supply agreement upon written notice if the other party is in material breach of any provision thereof  subject to applicable or day cure periods 
either party may also terminate the supply agreement upon days prior written notice upon the occurrence of certain events involving the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party  and the supply agreement shall automatically terminate upon the occurrence of certain events specified therein 
moreover  we may elect to terminate the supply agreement if precision fails to meet its performance obligations regarding the manufacture of dyloject in accordance with gmp  and under certain other conditions 

table of contents in may  we entered into a development and toll manufacturing agreement the manufacturing agreement with baxter healthcare corporation baxter 
the agreement is for us drug supply and has a three year term  renewable thereafter in one year increments 
under the manufacturing agreement  we committed to purchase at least  worth of dyloject product manufactured to our specifications  commencing upon regulatory approval from the us food and drug administration fda 
as is customary in such agreements  either party may terminate upon written notice upon the occurrence of certain events  including breach  bankruptcy  insolvency or  subject to certain cure provisions and restrictions  including the lack of fda approval for dyloject by a specified date 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition 
we have been awarded government grants and contracts from the us department of defense dod and the national institutes of health the nih  which are used to subsidize our research and development projects 
the dod reimburses us for certain research and development subproject costs related to the pmi development program 
dod and nih revenue is recognized as subsidized project costs for each period are incurred 
contract and grant revenue is derived from internal headcount expense and external contractual expense  both of which are highly dependent on the timing  order and relationship of individual reimbursable subprojects 
our grant submissions may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of studies and clinical trials 
as of december   we had utilized all available contract and grant funding 
with the exception of revenues derived from government grants and contracts  we have generated no operating revenues since our inception 
however  we do expect to generate product revenues in from sales of our lead product dyloject primarily in the uk we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer 
inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
at december   our inventory consists entirely of dyloject 
we make the decision to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products at the point we believe future economic benefit will be realized  generally upon regulatory approval 
our inventory is currently manufactured by a third party manufacturer in the us 
we do not capitalize inventory produced by the manufacturer until a batch is completed and released 
a batch is released after testing and acceptance of the batch as commercially viable 
at that point  we assume ownership and title to the inventory  and incur a liability 
we do not have economic responsibility for product that is not commercially viable 
our inventory is initially considered work in process  as it is considered brite stock until it is labeled and packaged 
inventory is considered finished goods upon successful labeling and packaging of the product 
inventory is relieved to cost of goods sold upon sale at actual cost of production 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of deferred milestone payments related to our products when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized  generally upon regulatory approval 
these intangible assets were recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization and impairments 
they are amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining estimated useful lives  which is approximately years  and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 

table of contents research and development costs 
since our inception  we have incurred approximately million of research and development costs 
the major research projects undertaken by us include the development of dyloject  pmi and rylomine 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred for which there is no alternative future use 
for various reasons  many of which are outside our control  including timing and results of our clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval and dependence on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred to commercialize our products  nor is it possible to estimate when  if ever  any of our products will be approved by regulatory agencies for commercial sale 
in addition  we may experience adverse results in the development of our products  which could result in significant delays in obtaining approval to sell our products  additional costs to be incurred to obtain regulatory approval or failure to obtain regulatory approval 
in the event any of our product candidates were to experience setbacks  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
even if we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our products  failure of physicians and patients to accept our products as a safe  cost effective alternative compared to existing products would have a material adverse effect on our business 
share based payments 
we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share based payment awards 
in connection with valuing stock options and warrants  we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of domestic net operating loss carryforwards and million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which either expire on various dates through or can be carried forward indefinitely 
these loss carryforwards are available to reduce future federal  state and foreign taxable income  if any 
these loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities 
we have incurred operating losses since inception and have established valuation allowances equal to the total deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty with respect to achieving profitable operations in the future 
should the uncertainty regarding our ability to achieve profitable operations change in the future  we would reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance  the effect of which could be material to our financial statements 
contingencies and litigation 
there has been  and we expect there may be  significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices  regulatory issues  pricing  and patents and other intellectual property rights 
certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements certain warrants issued in conjunction with our common stock financing are equity linked derivatives and accordingly represent an off balance sheet arrangement 
these warrants meet the scope exception in paragraph a of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas  but instead included as a component of equity

r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r expands the definition of transactions and events that qualify as business combinations  requires that the acquired assets and liabilities  including contingencies  be recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in earnings  not goodwill  changes the recognition timing for restructuring costs  and requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred 
adoption of sfas r is required for combinations occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption and retroactive application of sfas r to fiscal years preceding the effective date are not permitted 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas re characterizes minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries as non controlling interests and requires the classification of minority interests as a component of equity 
under sfas  a change in control will be measured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
the effective date for sfas is for annual periods beginning on or after december  early adoption and retroactive application of sfas to fiscal years preceding the effective date are not permitted 
we currently do not expect the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  which delays the effective date of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   except for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis for which delayed application is permitted until fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe sfas or fsp fas will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk related to interest rates and foreign currency we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relation to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of december   our cash included approximately million of money market securities  and million in short term available for sale marketable securities 
additionally  at december  approximately million of our investments were invested in auction rate securities representing debt instruments issued by domestic government sponsored agencies 
due to recent adverse developments in the global credit and capital markets  certain auctions have failed as a result of liquidity issues 
as of march   we had reduced our exposure to approximately million in auction rate securities 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience any ratings downgrades on the auction note securities in our portfolio  we may incur impairments to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings  and the lack of liquidity of our auction note securities could have a material impact on our financial flexibility and ability to fund our operations 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk from inception to december   all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to current revenues 
a minor portion of our research expenses are payable in foreign currency 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
