the company s equity investments are not significant 
intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash includes currency on hand and time deposits with banks or other financial institutions 
cash equivalents represent money market mutual funds  a form of highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
as a result of the company s normal payment cycle  cash disbursement accounts representing outstanding checks not yet presented for payment of  million and  million are included in claims and other accounts payable  and client and rebates and guarantees payable at december  and december   respectively  including certain amounts reclassified from cash 
no overdraft or unsecured short term loan exists in relation to these negative balances 
short term and long term investments

see note  debt and refinancing  for additional information 
accounts receivable 
the company reports accounts receivable due from manufacturers and accounts receivable due from clients 
manufacturer accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from manufacturers for earned rebates and other prescription services 
unbilled rebates receivable from manufacturers are generally billed beginning days from the end of each quarter 
client accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from clients for the pbm and specialty pharmacy segments 
unbilled pbm receivables are primarily from clients and are typically billed within days based on the contractual billing schedule agreed upon with each client 
at the end of any given reporting period  unbilled pbm receivables from clients may represent up to two weeks of dispensing activity and will fluctuate at the end of a fiscal month depending on the timing of these billing cycles 
client accounts receivable  net  also includes a reduction for rebates and guarantees payable to clients when such are settled on a net basis in the form of an invoice credit 
in cases where rebates and guarantees are settled with the client on a net basis  and the rebates and guarantees payable are greater than the corresponding client accounts balances  the net liability is reclassified to client rebates and guarantees payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
when these payables are settled in the form of a check or wire  they are recorded on a gross basis and the entire liability is reflected in client rebates and guarantees payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s client accounts receivable also include premiums receivable from the center for medicare medicaid services cms for the medicare part d prescription drug program pdp product offering and premiums from members 
a component of the pbm business includes diabetic supplies dispensed by polymedica with the associated receivables primarily from insurance companies and government agencies 
this component of the pbm business also experiences slower accounts receivable turnover 
as of december  and december   identified net specialty pharmacy accounts receivable  primarily due from payors and patients  amounted to million and million  respectively 
a portion of the specialty pharmacy business includes reimbursement by payors  such as insurance companies  under a medical benefit  or by medicare or medicaid 
these transactions also involve higher patient co payments than experienced in the pbm business 
as a result  this portion of the specialty pharmacy business  which yields a higher margin than the pbm business  experiences slower accounts receivable turnover than in the aforementioned pbm cycle 
see note  segment reporting  for more information on the specialty pharmacy segment 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and december  of million and million  respectively  includes million and million  respectively  related to the specialty pharmacy segment  and at december   million related to polymedica 
the relatively higher allowance for the specialty pharmacy segment reflects a different credit risk profile than the pbm business  and is characterized by reimbursement through medical coverage  including government agencies  and higher patient co payments 
in addition  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts also reflects amounts associated with member premiums for the 
table of contents company s medicare part d product offering  as well as and diabetic supplies dispensed by polymedica and reimbursed by insurance companies and government agencies 
the company regularly reviews and analyzes the adequacy of the allowances based on a variety of factors  including the age of the outstanding receivable and the collection history 
when circumstances related to specific collection patterns change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted 
concentrations of risks 
in  the company had one client that represented of net revenues 
in each of and  the company had one client that represented of net revenues 
none of the company s other clients individually represented more than of net revenues in  or the company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable  which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies  insurance companies and private patients 
concentration of credit risk relating to these accounts receivable is limited by the diversity and number of patients and payors 
the company derives a substantial portion of its specialty pharmacy segment revenue from the sale of specialty drugs provided by a limited number of single source biopharmaceutical manufacturers 
inventories  net 
inventories  net  are located in the company s mail order pharmacies and in warehouses  consist solely of finished product primarily prescription drugs  and are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
property and equipment  net 
property and equipment  net  is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method for assets with useful lives as follows buildings  years  machinery  equipment and office furnishings  three to years  and computer software  three to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over three to five years 
costs for general and administrative expenses  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to existing systems  are expensed as incurred 
net revenues 
product net revenues consist principally of sales of prescription drugs to clients and members  either through the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or through the company s mail order pharmacies 
the majority of the company s product net revenues are derived on a fee for service basis 
specialty pharmacy product net revenues represent revenues from the sale of primarily biopharmaceutical drugs and are reported at the net amount billed to third party payors and patients 
the company s product net revenues also include revenues from the sale of diabetic supplies dispensed by polymedica 
the company recognizes product revenues when the prescriptions are dispensed through retail pharmacies in the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order pharmacies and received by members and patients 
the company evaluates client contracts using the indicators of emerging issues task force no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent eitf  to determine whether the company acts as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through the retail pharmacy network 
the company acts as a principal in most of its transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  including the portion of the price allocated by the client to be settled directly by the member co payment  as well as the company s administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because the company a has separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b is responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through its claims adjudication process  c commits to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manages the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are members of clients plans  and e has credit risk for the price due from the client 
in limited instances where the company adjudicates prescriptions at pharmacies that are under contract directly with the client and there are no financial risks to the company  such revenue is recorded at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the company for processing the claim net reporting 
the company s product net revenues also include premiums associated with the company s medicare part d pdp product offering 
this product involves prescription dispensing for members covered under the cms sponsored medicare part d benefit 
since  two of the company s insurance company subsidiaries have been operating under contracts 
table of contents with cms to offer a number of medicare part d pdp products 
the products involve underwriting the benefit and charging member premiums for prescription dispensing covered under the cms approved medicare part d benefit 
the company provides a medicare drug benefit that represents either i the minimum  standard level of benefits mandated by congress  or ii enhanced coverage  on behalf of certain clients  which exceeds the standard drug benefit in exchange for additional premiums 
the pdp premiums are determined based on the company s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms 
the pdp premiums are primarily comprised of amounts received from cms as part of a direct subsidy and an additional subsidy from cms for low income member premiums  as well as premium payments received from members 
these premiums are recognized ratably to product net revenues over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits 
premiums received in advance of the applicable benefit period are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
there is a possibility that the annual costs of drugs may be higher or lower than premium revenues 
as a result  cms provides a risk corridor adjustment for the standard drug benefit that compares the company s actual annual drug costs incurred to the targeted premiums in the company s cms approved bid 
based on specific collars in the risk corridor  the company will receive from cms additional premium amounts or be required to refund to cms previously received premium amounts 
the company calculates the risk corridor adjustment on a quarterly basis based on drug cost experience to date and records an adjustment to product net revenues with a corresponding account receivable or payable to cms reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to premiums  there are certain co payments and deductibles the cost share due by members based on prescription orders by those members  some of which are subsidized by cms in cases of low income membership 
the subsidy amounts received in advance are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
at the end of the contract term and based on actual annual drug costs incurred  subsidies are reconciled with actual costs and residual subsidy advance receipts are payable to cms 
the cost share is treated consistently as other co payments derived from providing pbm services  as a component of product net revenues in the consolidated statements of income where the requirements of eitf are met 
in  premium revenues for the company s pdp product  which exclude member cost share  were million  or less than of total net revenues 
in  premium revenues for the company s pdp product  excluding member cost share  were million  or approximately of total net revenues 
the company s agreements with cms  as well as applicable medicare part d regulations and federal and state laws  require the company to  among other obligations i comply with certain disclosure  filing  record keeping and marketing rules  ii operate quality assurance  drug utilization management and medication therapy management programs  iii support e prescribing initiatives  iv implement grievance  appeals and formulary exception processes  v comply with payment protocols  which include the return of overpayments to cms and  in certain circumstances  coordination with state pharmacy assistance programs  vi use approved networks and formularies  and provide access to such networks to any willing pharmacy  vii provide emergency out of network coverage  and viii adopt a comprehensive medicare and fraud  waste and abuse compliance program 
as a cms approved pdp  the company s policies and practices associated with executing the program are subject to audit  and if material contractual or regulatory non compliance was to be identified  applicable sanctions and or monetary penalties may be imposed 
rebates and guarantees regarding the level of service the company will provide to the client or member or the minimum level of rebates or discounts the client will receive are deducted from product net revenues as they are earned by the client 
rebates are generally credited or paid to clients subsequent to collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers  although there are certain instances where rebates are paid to clients on a more accelerated basis 
other contractual payments made to clients are generally made upon initiation of contracts as implementation allowances  which may  for example  be designated by clients as funding for their costs to transition their plans to the company 
the company considers these payments to be an integral part of the company s pricing of a contract and believes that they represent only a variability in the timing of cash flows that does not change the underlying economics of the contract 
accordingly  these payments are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of product net revenues  generally on a straight line basis  over the life of the contract where the payments are refundable upon cancellation of the contract or relate to noncancelable contracts 
amounts capitalized are assessed periodically for recoverability based on the profitability of the contract 
service revenues consist principally of administrative fees and clinical program fees earned from clients and other 
table of contents non product related revenues  sales of prescription services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and data to other parties  and performance oriented fees paid by specialty pharmacy manufacturers 
service revenues are recorded by the company when performance occurs and collectibility is assured 
cost of revenues 
cost of product net revenues includes the cost of inventory dispensed from the mail order pharmacies  along with direct dispensing costs and associated depreciation 
cost of product net revenues also includes ingredient costs of drugs dispensed by and professional fees paid to retail network pharmacies 
in addition  cost of product net revenues includes the operating costs of the company s call center pharmacies  which primarily respond to member and retail pharmacist inquiries regarding member prescriptions  as well as physician calls 
cost of product net revenues also includes an offsetting credit for rebates earned from pharmaceutical manufacturers whose drugs are included on the company s preferred drug lists  which are also known as formularies 
rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are accrued in the period earned by multiplying estimated rebatable prescription drugs dispensed through the company s retail network and through the company s mail order pharmacies by the contractually agreed manufacturer rebate amount 
rebates receivable estimates are revised to actual  with the difference recorded to cost of revenues  upon billing to the manufacturer  generally to days subsequent to the end of the applicable quarter 
these bills are not issued until the necessary specific eligible claims and third party market share data are received and thoroughly analyzed 
historically  the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized and recorded to actual amounts billed has not been material to the company s results of operations 
the company s cost of product net revenues also includes the cost of drugs dispensed by the company s mail order pharmacies or retail network for members covered under the company s medicare part d pdp product offering and are recorded at cost as incurred 
the company receives a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy from cms for approximately of costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out of pocket maximum of  million for coverage year and  million for coverage year the subsidy is reflected as an offsetting credit in cost of product net revenues to the extent that catastrophic costs are incurred 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidy amounts received in advance are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
at the end of the contract term and based on actual annual drug costs incurred  residual subsidy advance receipts are payable to cms 
cost of service revenues consists principally of labor and operating costs for delivery of services provided  and costs associated with member communication materials 
goodwill 
goodwill of  million at december  and  million at december  represents  for the pbm segment  the push down of the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the company s net assets from the acquisition of the company by merck in  and  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisitions of polymedica in  and provantage health services  inc provantage in goodwill also includes  for the specialty pharmacy segment  a portion of the excess of the accredo purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of critical care systems  inc critical care in  and the acquisition of selected assets of pediatric services of america  inc pediatric services in see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information 
the company s goodwill balance is also assessed for impairment using a two step fair value based test annually or whenever events  or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  for each of the company s segments reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the assets assigned to that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit  the company would then be required to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit for purposes of calculating the amount of goodwill impairment 
the most recent assessment of goodwill impairment for each of the designated reporting units was performed as of september   and the recorded goodwill was determined not to be impaired 
intangible assets  net 
intangible assets  net  of  million at december  and  million at december   net of accumulated amortization of  million at december  and  million at december  primarily reflect  for the pbm segment  the value of client relationships that arose in connection with the acquisition of the company by merck in and that have been pushed down to the consolidated balance sheets of the company  as well as intangible assets recorded upon our acquisition of polymedica in  including the value of the liberty trade name  which is indefinite lived  and customer relationships 
additionally  for the specialty pharmacy 
table of contents segment  intangible assets primarily include the portion of the excess of the accredo purchase price over tangible net assets acquired that has been allocated to intangible assets 
see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information 
our definite lived intangible assets are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events  such as losses of significant clients or biotechnology manufacturer contracts  or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when these events occur  the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the pre tax undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset grouping 
if this comparison indicates impairment exists  the amount of the impairment would be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
our indefinite lived intangible will be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if a change in events warrants such a review by comparing its carrying amount to its fair value 
an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible 
effective with the accredo acquisition on august   the weighted average useful life of intangible assets subject to amortization was years in total and by major asset class was approximately years for the pbm client relationships and approximately years for the accredo intangibles  with the annual intangible amortization expense increasing to million in from million in as of december   the weighted average useful life of intangible assets subject to amortization is years in total and by major asset class is approximately years for the pbm intangible assets and approximately years for the specialty acquired intangible assets 
the annual intangible amortization expense is estimated to increase to million in from million in  reflecting the full year effect of polymedica and critical care

in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for periods prior to january  have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r as the company did not record stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans recognized under sfas r for the fiscal years ended december  and december  amounted to million and million on a pre tax basis  respectively 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the portion of the value that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based awards using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized related to options because the exercise price of the company s stock options granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of the grant 
in addition  sfas r requires that the benefits of realized tax deductions in excess of tax benefits on compensation expense  which amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively  be reported as a component of cash flows from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow  as previously required

in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans to the straight line single option method 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and december  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company estimates forfeitures in the same manner under sfas r as it did prior to its adoption 

table of contents stock based compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plans recognized as a result of the adoption of sfas r was comprised as follows in millions  except for per share data fiscal years cost of product net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses total stock based compensation expense  before taxes related income tax benefits stock based compensation expense  net of taxes earnings per share effect basic diluted stock based compensation expense includes stock option expense of million million pre tax  and employee stock purchase plan expense of million million pre tax

segment reporting reportable segments 
as a result of the company s acquisition of accredo in august  the company has two reportable segments  pbm and specialty pharmacy 
the pbm segment involves sales of traditional prescription drugs and supplies to the company s clients and members  either through the company s network of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order pharmacies 
the pbm segment also includes the operating results of polymedica  a provider of diabetes testing supplies and related products to patients with diabetes  commencing october   the date of the acquisition 
the specialty pharmacy segment  which was formed upon the accredo acquisition and is also comprised of specialty pharmacy activity previously included within medco s pbm business  includes the sale of higher margin specialty pharmacy products and services for the treatment of chronic and complex potentially life threatening diseases 
the specialty pharmacy segment also includes the operating results of critical care  a provider of specialty infusion services  commencing november   the date of acquisition 
the company defines the specialty pharmacy segment based on a product set and associated services  broadly characterized to include drugs that are high cost  usually developed by biotechnology companies and often injectable  and 
table of contents which require elevated levels of patient support 
when dispensed  these products frequently require ancillary administration equipment  special packaging and a higher degree of patient oriented customer service than is required in the traditional pbm business model 
in addition  specialty pharmacy products and services are often covered through medical benefit programs with the primary payors being insurance companies and government programs  along with patients  as well as pbm clients as payors 
factors used to identify reportable segments 
the specialty pharmacy segment was formed as a result of the acquisition of accredo in response to a management desire to manage the acquired business together with medco s pre existing specialty pharmacy activity as a separate business from medco s pbm operations 
this acquisition complemented the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy operation  which was evolving in prior to the acquisition  results for the specialty pharmacy business were neither prepared nor provided to the chief operating decision maker  as he managed medco on a consolidated entity level 
during  medco established procedures and controls and implemented system solutions in order to identify discrete financial information on a prospective basis for the specialty pharmacy activities in anticipation of the combination of those activities with accredo into a separate segment  effective with the closing of the accredo acquisition 
until these procedures  controls and systems were implemented during  the complexity of the company s manufacturer and client contracts  determining the appropriate cost of inventory and retail reimbursement  as well as the shared costs between the pbm and specialty pharmacy activities prevented medco from preparing detailed separate profitability financial results for specialty pharmacy for periods prior to the formation of the segment in august of selected segment income and asset information 
total net revenues and operating income are measures used by the chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of each of the company s operating segments 
the following tables present selected financial information about the company s reportable segments  including a reconciliation of operating income to income before provision for income taxes in millions for fiscal years ended december  december  december  specialty specialty specialty pbm pharmacy total pbm pharmacy total pbm pharmacy total product net revenues total service revenues total net revenues total cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles operating income reconciling item to income before provision for income taxes interest and other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes capital expenditures includes polymedica s operating results commencing october   the date of acquisition 
includes critical care s operating results commencing november   the date of acquisition 
includes a first quarter pre tax legal settlements charge of million recorded to sg a expenses 
fiscal represents a week fiscal year 
all other fiscal years are comprised of weeks 
includes eight fiscal months of specialty pharmacy activity previously included in medco s pbm business 
the specialty pharmacy segment commenced on august   the date of the accredo acquisition 
if the company had owned accredo for the full fiscal year ended december   it is estimated that the specialty pharmacy segment net revenues would represent approximately of total medco net revenues 

table of contents as of december  as of december  specialty specialty identifiable assets pbm pharmacy total pbm pharmacy total total identifiable assets the company estimates that the specialty pharmacy results of operations  including the effect of the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy results of operations  reflect approximately billion in total net revenues and approximately million in operating income for the full fiscal year ended december  medco calculated the estimated full year operating income for fiscal year based on the best information available for the pre acquisition period and the detailed post acquisition segment results 
medco specialty pharmacy operations approximate the overall pbm operating income as a percentage to revenue as the product pricing and service model was substantially consistent with the overall pbm business in that period 
medco s operating results for fiscal year  excluding the effect of the accredo acquisition  would have reflected  million in net revenues  and million in operating income 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in litigation  claims  government inquiries  investigations  charges and proceedings  including  but not limited to  those relating to regulatory  commercial  employment  employee benefits and securities matters 
the most significant of these matters are described below 
there is uncertainty regarding the possible course and outcome of the proceedings discussed below 
although it is not feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of any proceedings with certainty  the company believes there is no litigation pending against the company that could have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  liquidity and operating results 
however  there can be no assurances that an adverse outcome in any of the lawsuits described below will not result in material fines  penalties and damages  changes to the company s business practices  loss of or litigation with clients or a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  liquidity and operating results 
it is also possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters  or changes in the company s assumptions or its strategies related to these proceedings 
the company continues to believe that its business practices comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and is vigorously defending itself in the actions described below 
the company believes that most of the claims made in these legal proceedings and government investigations would not likely be covered by insurance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management 
government proceedings and requests for information 
the company is aware of the existence of two sealed qui tam matters 
the first action is filed in the eastern district of pennsylvania and it appears to allege that the company billed government payors using invalid or out of date national drug codes ndcs 
the second action is filed in the district of new jersey and appears to allege that the company charged government payors a different rate than it reimbursed pharmacies  engaged in duplicate billing  refilled prescriptions too soon  and billed government payors for prescriptions written by unlicensed physicians and physicians with invalid drug enforcement agency authorizations 
the department of justice has not yet made any decision as to whether it will intervene in either of these matters 
the matters are under seal and us district court orders prohibit the company from answering inquiries about the complaints 
the company was notified of the existence of these two qui tam matters during settlement negotiations on an unrelated matter with the department of justice in the company does not know the identities of the relators in either of these matters 
these two qui tam matters were not considered in the company s settlement with the department of justice discussed in note  legal settlements charge  included in this annual report on form k
