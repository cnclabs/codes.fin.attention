table of contents results of operations our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable for the following reasons on september   wynn macau completed the sale of a macau subconcession right and received a cash payment of million  on september   we opened wynn macau and began generating operating cash flow  on april   we opened wynn las vegas and began generating operating cash flow 
prior to april   we were solely a development stage company 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  include full years of operations for both wynn las vegas and wynn macau 
in contrast  the year ended december  includes a full year of operations for wynn las vegas and days of operations for wynn macau 
wynn las vegas operated for days in the year ended december  the table below displays our net revenues for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands 
for the years ended december  net revenues wynn las vegas wynn macau total net revenues the reliance on our operating cash flow from only two properties exposes us to certain risks that competitors  whose operations are more diversified  may be better able to control 
in addition to the concentration of operations in two properties  many of our customers are high end gaming customers who wager on credit  thus exposing us to increased credit risk 
high end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results 
operating measures certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussions of our operational performance for the periods in which a consolidated statement of operations is presented 
casinos generally record table games win as a percentage of either drop or turnover and slot win as a percentage of handle 
in our casino operations at wynn las vegas  table games win is recorded as a percentage of drop 
however  in our casino operations at wynn macau  we separate table play into two distinct segments 
our macau vip casino segment records table games win as a percentage of turnover  whereas our general casino records win as a percentage of drop 
below are definitions of the statistics discussed table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue 
drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table s drop box 
turnover is the sum of all losing wagers within our wynn macau vip program 
slot win is the amount of handle representing the total amount wagered that is retained by wynn las vegas or wynn macau and is recorded as casino revenue 
average daily rate adr is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms occupied 
revenue per available room revpar is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms available

we expect that pre opening costs will continue to be incurred in the months before opening as construction and development of encore and the wynn diamond suites progress 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  of million increased by million when compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a full year of depreciation expense associated with wynn macau as well as the placement into service of wynn macau s expansion 
during the construction of wynn las vegas and wynn macau  costs incurred in the construction of the buildings  improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized 
once these properties opened  their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense 
the depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets 
in addition  we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment  intangibles and other assets 
when circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life  we adjust them accordingly 
the maximum useful life of assets at wynn macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession  which currently expire in june and  respectively 
consequently  depreciation related to wynn macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to wynn las vegas
