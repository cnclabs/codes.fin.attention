item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing an overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
who we are we are an investment grade rated since  public equity  healthcare reit that seeks to provide stockholders with an attractive total return comprised of a secure  growing dividend and stock appreciation by passively investing in healthcare properties 
the healthcare sector is relatively recession resistant and presents unique growth potential as evidenced by the well known favorable demographics and increasing market penetration of a rapidly growing senior population  the increased use of healthcare services led by the aging baby boomer generation and  in each case  the corresponding recognized need for additional and improved healthcare facilities and services 
our management team has extensive operating backgrounds in senior housing and long term care that we believe provides us a competitive advantage in these sectors 
in addition  as described in greater detail below under focus and outlook for  we have embarked on a strategic initiative to establish and grow a full service medical office building platform comprised of a class a portfolio of facilities backed by well regarded property management services and development capabilities 
what we invest in we invest passively in the following types of geographically diversified healthcare properties senior housing assisted and independent living facilities alfs  ilfs and alzs 
this primarily private pay backed sector breaks down into three principal categories  each of which may be operated on a stand alone basis or combined with one or more of the others into a single facility or campus assisted living facilities alfs designed for frail seniors who can no longer live independently and instead need assistance with activities of daily living ie  feeding  dressing  bathing  etc 
but do not require round the clock skilled nursing care 
independent living facilities ilfs designed for seniors who pay for some concierge type services eg  meals  housekeeping  laundry  transportation  and social and recreational activities but require little  if any  assistance with activities of daily living 
alzheimer facilities alzs designed for those residents with significant cognitive impairment as a result of having alzheimer s or related dementia 
long term care skilled nursing facilities snfs 
this primarily government medicare and medicaid reimbursement backed sector consists of skilled nursing facilities designed for inpatient rehabilitative  restorative  skilled nursing and other medical treatment for residents who are medically stable and do not require the intensive care of an acute care or rehabilitative hospital 
continuing care retirement communities ccrcs 
these communities are designed to provide a continuum of care for residents as they age and their health deteriorates and typically combine on a defined campus integrated senior housing and long term care facilities 
medical office buildings mobs 
mobs are typically on or near an acute care hospital campus 
they usually house several different unrelated medical practices  although they can be associated with a large single specialty or multi specialty group 
mob tenants include physicians  dentists  psychologists  therapists and other healthcare providers  with space devoted to patient examination and treatment  diagnostic imaging  outpatient surgery and other outpatient services 

table of contents how we do it using a three prong foundation that focuses on proactive capital management  active portfolio management and quality funds from operations ffo growth  we typically invest in senior housing  long term care facilities and medical office buildings as provided below 
senior housing and long term care including ccrcs 
we primarily make our investments in these properties passively by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated tenants under triple net master leases that transfer the obligation for all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
to the tenants 
in addition  but to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater  from time to time  we extend mortgage loans and other financing to tenants  generally at higher rates than we charge for rent on our owned facilities 
currently  about of our revenues from this area are derived from our leases  with the remaining from our mortgage loans and other financing 
medical office buildings mobs 
through  we have primarily made our investments in mobs through joint ventures with specialists in this sector 
our partner typically manages the venture and provides property management services 
since an mob generally has several tenants under separate leases  these services typically include rent collection from disparate tenants  re marketing space as it becomes vacant and other day to day property management 
in addition  to the extent the leases are not triple net  the services include active management and responsibility for many of the mob s associated operating expenses although many of these are  or can effectively be  passed through to the tenants as well 
how we measure our progress funds from operations we believe that ffo is an important non gaap supplemental measure of operating performance because it excludes the effect of depreciation and gains losses from sales of facilities both of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
additionally  ffo is widely used by industry analysts as a measure of operating performance for equity reits 
we therefore discuss ffo  although it is a measurement that is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states it does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
what we have accomplished over the last three years we have enjoyed numerous successes since the end of  perhaps the most notable of which are as follows management smooth senior management transition 
the entire senior management team was reconstituted during and douglas pasquale became our chief executive officer  followed shortly by the promotion of donald bradley to chief investment officer  the hiring of abdo khoury as chief portfolio officer and his subsequent promotion to chief financial and portfolio officer  coupled with the promotion of david snyder to vice president and controller 
investments 
we invested  directly and through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures  billion in the last three years  after having invested only million in the previous three year period 
in addition  with over billion of closed investments in  we achieved our fourth consecutive record investment year 
doubled investment portfolio our net investments in real estate have grown from billion at the end of to billion at the end of 
table of contents increased focus on private pay senior housing due in large part to our extensive senior housing operating backgrounds  we have been able to acquire a variety of senior housing portfolios that have increased the private pay component of our revenues from at the end of to at the end of further asset diversification with investment in medical office buildings in the first quarter of  we completed our first investment in mobs 
at the end of  this asset class represented of our investments and  as described in greater detail below under focus and outlook for  is expected to grow substantially as a result of our strategic initiative dedicated to the establishment of a full service mob platform 
capital more flexible and diverse structure and conservative balance sheet 
our overall capital goal has been to balance the debt and equity components of our capital structure  increase our sources of capital  enhance our credit statistics  preserve and strengthen our investment grade credit ratings moody s investors service baa  standard poor s ratings service bbb and fitch ratings bbb and improve our cost of capital to position ourselves to make accretive acquisitions in an increasingly competitive market 
we believe we have accomplished all of these goals  with the following items being particularly noteworthy credit facility increased from million at the end of to our current million facility with substantially improved terms 
capital markets issued approximately million of equity and million of long term debt in marketed deals with industry standard covenants 
controlled equity offering implemented a program in under which we periodically issue equity at an average price over the volume weighted average price  subject to fees of under 
to date  we have issued approximately million shares of common stock under this program  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
institutional joint venture capital formed a joint venture in january with a state pension fund investor advised by morgan stanley real estate to provide an additional capital source 
the joint venture has invested million in assisted and independent living facilities  skilled nursing facilities and continuing care retirement communities  including million in facilities acquired by the joint venture from us  and has an approved capacity to invest up to million in these property types 
asset management capital sold skilled nursing facilities primarily located in texas with an average age of years for million an capitalization rate on our rent in and invested a total of million in in skilled nursing facilities  including million through our unconsolidated joint venture in much newer skilled nursing facilities with an average starting rent rate of 
this follows the sale to brookdale of senior housing assets previously leased to them of about million a capitalization rate on our rent  with the proceeds reinvested at an starting rent rate in new investments with new growth oriented customers 
portfolio management implemented sophisticated program 
since the end of  we have dramatically upgraded our portfolio management program by developing a proprietary software system and adding five dedicated portfolio management personnel 
we believe we now have one of the most sophisticated portfolio management programs in our industry 
dividend secure and growing 
we have lowered our dividend coverage ratio dividends per share divided by normalized ffo per share from at the end of to at the end of while raising our annual dividend by 

table of contents focus and outlook for in we will focus on improving our net income and ffo on an absolute and per share basis and further diversifying our portfolio 
we will also explore alternative capital sources  investment structures  joint ventures and property types that would enable us to compete more effectively in the markets in which we currently invest 
on february   we announced we have entered into an agreement with pacific medical buildings llc  a california limited liability company pmb  and certain of its affiliates  to acquire up to mobs for million 
the mobs  which comprise approximately million square feet and include six that are currently in development  are located in california  nevada  hawaii  oregon and arizona 
the acquisition of each of the mobs is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
fourteen of the mobs are expected to be acquired in  two in and two in at the first closing under the agreement with pmb  we will enter into an agreement with pmb in which we will obtain the right  but not the obligation  to acquire up to billion of mobs to be developed by pmb over the following seven years 
we also entered into an agreement with pmb to acquire a interest in pmb real estate services llc pmbres  a full service property management company 
in consideration for the interest  we will pay million at closing  and may make additional payments in the future based on operating profits through pmbres will provide property and asset management services for the mobs that will be acquired in this transaction and for other facilities we acquired in it will receive an annual asset management fee of of revenues  an annual property management fee of of revenues and standard leasing and construction management fees 
with respect to our triple net lease business  we expect the rent escalators in our leases  generally between and  to generate substantial net income growth and ffo growth 
while the market remains extremely competitive  we continue to see potentially attractive investment opportunities that we will carefully evaluate 
in management s view  there are several principal near term challenges we face in achieving our business objectives 
the first principal challenge is closing our announced transaction with pmb to achieve our strategic initiative dedicated to the establishment of a full service mob platform 
this will entail the successful completion of our confirmatory due diligence and the fulfillment of a number of closing conditions  many of which are outside our control 
the second principal challenge is the continued availability of competitively priced capital 
this in turn is largely dependent on external factors such as interest rates  debt capital market volatility and availability and equity market volatility 
during the second half of and early  both the debt and equity markets have been generally very unfavorable  although there have occasionally been periods with good availability and pricing 
in addition  if there is a recession during  it could further limit our access to capital 
the third principal challenge we face is possible further consolidation at the reit or operator levels which is likely to result in better capitalized competitors and fewer customers  respectively 
finally  although we think less likely  there may be operator financial problems that lead to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular operator or it could be industry wide  such as federal or state governmental reimbursement reductions in the case of our skilled nursing facilities as governments work through their budget deficits  reduced occupancies for our assisted and independent living facilities due to general economic and other factors or increases in liability insurance premiums or other expenses 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors 
table of contents that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition rental income from operating leases is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  including statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition as amended by sec sab no 
our leases generally contain annual escalators 
most of our leases contain non contingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognizing income on a straight line basis requires us to calculate the total non contingent rent to be paid over the life of a lease and to recognize the revenue evenly over that life 
this method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received  creating a straight line rent receivable asset included in the caption other assets on our balance sheets 
at some point during the lease  depending on its terms  the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straight line rent which results in the straight line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term 
we assess the collectibility of straight line rents in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and our reserve policy and defer recognition of straight line rent if its collectibility is not reasonably assured 
certain leases contain escalators contingent on revenues or other factors  including increases based solely on changes in the consumer price index 
such revenue increases are recognized over the lease term as the related contingencies occur 
our assessment of the collectibility of straight line rents is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the tenant  the type of facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current tenant  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we defer recognition of the straight line rental income and  depending on the circumstances  we may provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight line rent receivable asset for a portion  up to its full value  that we estimate may not be recoverable 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease change  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the rental revenue recognized or to reserve or further reserve the existing straight line rent receivable balance 
we recorded million of revenues in excess of cash received during  million of revenues in excess of cash during and million of cash received in excess of revenues during we have straight line rent receivables  net of reserves  recorded under the caption other assets on our balance sheets of million at december   and million at december  we evaluate the collectibility of the straight line rent receivable balances on an ongoing basis and provide reserves against receivables we believe may not be fully recoverable 
the ultimate amount of straight line rent we realize could be less than amounts recorded 
depreciation and useful lives of assets we calculate depreciation on our buildings and improvements using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging up to years  generally from to years depending on factors including building type  age  quality and location 
a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to buildings 
for our triple net leased buildings  this amount generally approximates 
for medical office buildings that are not leased under a single triple net lease  this percentage may be substantially lower as we allocate purchase prices in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations sfas no 
which generally results in substantial allocations to assets such as lease up intangible assets  above below market tenant and ground lease intangible assets and in place lease intangible assets  collectively intangible lease assets  included in the caption other assets on our balance sheets 

table of contents the allocation of the cost between land and building  and the determination of the useful life of a property are based on management s estimates 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we amortize intangible lease assets over the remaining lease terms of the respective leases 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
if we overestimate the useful life of an asset  the depreciation expense related to the asset will be understated  which could result in a loss if the asset is sold in the future 
asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

indicators may include  among others  a tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by a tenant that it will not renew its lease  or a decision to dispose of an asset or adverse changes in the fair value of any of our properties 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  in accordance with sfas nos 
and  we conclude no impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is lower than its current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less selling costs 
the above analyses require us to determine whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such asset 
no impairment charges were recorded during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized impairment charges of million related to two skilled nursing facilities in assets held for sale to write them down to their estimated fair values less selling costs 
collectibility of receivables we evaluate the collectibility of our rent  mortgage loans and other receivables on a regular basis based on factors including  among others  payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  the asset type and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that may not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable

operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  triple net lease rental income increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from facilities acquired in  facilities acquired during and rent increases at existing facilities

sfas no 
requires the operating results of any assets with their own identifiable cash flows that are disposed of or held for sale and in which we have no continuing interest be removed from income from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations 
the operating results for any such assets for any prior periods presented must also be reclassified as discontinued operations 
if we have a continuing investment  as in the sales to our unconsolidated joint venture  the operating results remain in continuing operations

the difference in the composition of discontinued operations income  excluding the gains  was 
table of contents primarily caused by the inclusion of income from facilities sold in and in discontinued operations in while only income from facilities sold in is included in discontinued operations in we expect to have future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale  and the related income or loss would be included in discontinued operations unless the facilities were transferred to an entity in which we maintain an interest 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  triple net lease rental income increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from facilities acquired in  facilities acquired during and rent increases at existing facilities 
operating rent was generated by the multi tenant medical office building portfolio we acquired during the first quarter of through one of our consolidated joint ventures

medical office building operating expenses relate to the operations of the multi tenant medical office building portfolio that was acquired during the first quarter of through one of our consolidated joint ventures 
during  we recognized an impairment charge of million in continuing operations 
the impairment related to a receivable from the operator of two facilities  one of which was impaired for million in  which portion of the impairment is reported in discontinued operations because we transferred the building to assets held for sale sfas no 
requires the operating results of any assets with their own identifiable cash flows that are disposed of or held for sale and in which we have no continuing interest be removed from income from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations 
the operating results for any such assets for any prior periods presented must also be reclassified as discontinued operations

table of contents million and interest and other income of million  partially offset by depreciation of million  interest expense of million  impairment charges of million and general and administrative expenses of million 
discontinued operations income of million for was comprised of rent revenue of million and gains on sale of million  partially offset by depreciation of million  asset impairment charges of million  interest expense of million and general and administrative expenses of million 
the difference in the composition of discontinued operations income excluding the gains and impairments was primarily caused by the fact that income from facilities sold during and is included in discontinued operations in while only income from facilities sold in is included in discontinued operations in we expect to have future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale  and the related income or loss would be included in discontinued operations unless the facilities were transferred to an entity in which we maintain an interest 
our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if facility revenues and or the consumer price index do not increase  our revenues may not increase 
rent levels under renewed leases will also impact revenues 
as of december   we had leases on facilities expiring in tenant purchase option exercises would decrease rental income 
we believe our tenants may exercise purchase options on assets with option prices totaling approximately million during we expect to make additional acquisitions during  although we cannot predict the quantity and timing of any such acquisitions 
as we make additional investments in facilities  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by associated rental or interest income 
while additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase revenues  facility sales or mortgage repayments would serve to offset any revenue increases and could reduce revenues

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans receivable and debt 
we may hold derivative instruments to manage our exposure to these risks  and all derivative instruments are matched against specific debt obligations

table of contents we provide mortgage loans to tenants of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations  which generally have fixed rates  and all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt has variable rates during the twelve months ended december   the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility have decreased from million to million 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
the first table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates as of december  certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total book value fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable  net average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured revolving credit facility average interest rate 
table of contents the book value and fair value at december  of each category presented above was book value fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable  net average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate credit facility average interest rate any future interest rate increases will increase the cost of borrowings on our bank line of credit and any borrowings to refinance long term debt as it matures or to finance future acquisitions
