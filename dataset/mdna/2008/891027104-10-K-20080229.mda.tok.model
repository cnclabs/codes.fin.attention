item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
we view our operations by segments  which are the major insurance product lines of life  health  and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting  and benefit administration of policies 
each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue less policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources  including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is net investment income less interest credited to net policy liabilities financing costs the tables in note business segments reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations net income increased or million to million in  and or million to million in the life insurance segment contributed million to pretax growth in the margin  the largest contributor 
life insurance margin growth in resulted from both premium growth and favorable mortality 
also adding to pretax earnings growth was the investment segment  from which excess investment income rose million or 
it had declined in both of the previous two years 
excess investment income in was positively affected by lower financing costs on our debt as a result of the refinancing of two debt issues in the primary contributor to growth in earnings was the health insurance segment  as we first offered medicare part d for coverage beginning january  our medicare part d product accounted for million of the million growth in health margins 
the life insurance segment also added million to our million growth in pretax earnings in excess investment income declined in both and  as it was compressed by a flattened yield curve and as significant amounts of cash have been used to repurchase torchmark shares 
total revenues rose in to billion 
in  total revenues increased to billion from billion in growth in life premium of million and net investment income of million accounted for the growth in revenues 
the revenue increase was primarily the result of the million of premium added from medicare part d 
growth in life premium and net investment income also contributed to revenue growth 
life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december   rising in to billion and in margins as a percentage of premium have also increased slightly each year to of premium in from in and while premium and margin percentage growth have resulted in increases in the total life insurance segment s contribution to pretax earnings  sales volumes have declined slightly each year 
life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 

table of contents 
index to financial statements health premium was flat in compared with at billion 
however  it rose or million in from billion in  but million of the growth came from medicare part d premium which was offered for the first time in since the majority of the country s part d enrollees selected a plan in  we do not expect significant growth in our part d business going forward 
medicare supplement has historically accounted for the largest portion of our health premium 
over the past few years  however  increased competition in the medicare supplement business has continued to dampen health sales  and has resulted in declines in the premium from this product each year 
at the same time  net sales of our under age limited benefit health products have grown significantly over the past few years  as demand for these products continues to increase 
as a result  premium from the limited benefit health products are expected to overtake medicare supplement premium in see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
while we still offer annuities  we do not plan to emphasize annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
see the caption annuities for further discussion 
as previously mentioned  the investment segment s pretax profitability  or excess investment income  increased million or in  after having declined in each of the last two years 
the investment segment s income was positively affected by a decline in our interest expense on debt  due to the refinancing of the two funded debt issues noted below 
however  growth in total investment income has been negatively affected by torchmark s share repurchase program described later under this caption  which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments 
management believes that the acquisition of torchmark stock at favorable prices provides a superior return on available cash 
additionally  the lower long term interest rates available for new investments during the past three years have caused our average portfolio yield to decline in each successive year  restricting growth in net investment income and excess investment income 
at the same time  short term rates have risen and stayed at higher levels during the three year period  negatively affecting excess investment income 
during and continuing through mid  short term rates rose with no meaningful change in long term rates 
the rising short term rates caused short term financing costs to increase and the income spread on torchmark s fixed to variable interest rate swaps to narrow 
because of the diminished profitability of these swaps  all of the swaps were disposed of by june  see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 
during the second quarter of  we issued two new debt securities in separate public offerings our trust preferred securities  redemption amount million and our senior notes  par value million 
these offerings essentially provided funding for the repayment of two existing debt instruments in the fourth quarter of the call of our trust preferred securities at a redemption price of million and the maturity of our senior notes  par value million 
more information on these transactions can be found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 
we had million of after tax realized investment gains in  compared with after tax realized investment losses of million in there was an immaterial amount of after tax realized investment gains in realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
under the caption realized gains and losses in this report  we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses 
also  as explained in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 
in each of the years through  net income was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring nonoperating items 
we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
a discussion of these items follows 
in  we recorded an after tax charge of thousand million pretax pertaining to litigation 
this litigation involved net settlements after expenses primarily in three significant legal matters our subsidiary liberty s race distinct mortality dual pricing litigation  its class action cancer case  and the

index to financial statements waddell reed litigation 
all of the settlements of these cases relate to litigation arising many years ago and are not relevant to current operations 
of this pre tax amount  million is recorded as other income and million is recorded as other operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
for more information on these litigation items  see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
also in  we recorded a million settlement benefit from an internal revenue service examination covering several years 
this tax settlement reduced tax expense 
more information on this tax settlement is provided in note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  a noncash after tax charge of thousand was recorded as a result of the extension in the term of a previously granted stock option for a senior officer upon retirement 
the option extension expense was recorded as administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we received four litigation and tax settlements  two of which were concerned with issues related to a subsidiary and an investment disposed of several years ago  a third involving our investment in worldcom  inc bonds worldcom  which was held and sold in prior years  and a fourth concerning federal income tax issues arising from examinations of prior years 
the first settlement  involving the disposed subsidiary  resulted in state income tax refunds of million net of expenses million net of tax which were received and reported above as a tax settlement 
the second settlement involving the investment resulted in proceeds of million net of expenses million net of tax and is included in the table above as a legal settlement 
in the third settlement  we received million million after tax in connection with our worldcom class action litigation for recovery of a portion of investment losses 
this item is included in the table above as a litigation settlement 
the federal income tax settlement resulted in benefits due us of million  included as tax settlements in the table above 
the two litigation settlements were included in other income and the two tax settlements reduced income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
all four of these cases involved litigation or issues arising years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations 
additionally in  liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings  replacing them with rental facilities 
in  buildings were sold for gross proceeds of million and a pre tax gain of million 
because of the significant scale of this nonoperating item  we have removed million million after tax from our core results representing the gain from the sales 
liberty s program to dispose of its agency office buildings continued in as a result  additional buildings were sold for proceeds of million and a pre tax gain of million million after tax 
also in  additional legal costs or settlements from litigation relating to prior periods were recorded 
we received an additional thousand thousand after tax in settlement proceeds from the worldcom litigation discussed above 
we also incurred additional costs relating to liberty national s race distinct pricing litigation that was settled in and was also discussed above 
these costs were thousand thousand after tax 
additionally  in  we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million relating primarily to settlements of prior year examinations  presented as tax settlements in the table above 
this item reduced income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note for more information on this settlement 
we redomesticated two of our insurance subsidiaries  united american and globe  to the state of nebraska in this redomestication will benefit us going forward by reducing premium tax rates in these companies 
we plan to redomesticate other subsidiaries to nebraska in the future

index to financial statements torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in and was reaffirmed at its july  board of director s meeting 
with no specified authorization amount  we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises 
the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december  analysis of share purchases amounts in thousands purchases shares amount shares amount shares amount excess cash flow and borrowings option proceeds total in  million shares at a cost of million related to the option restoration program more fully discussed under the caption capital resources 
throughout the remainder of this discussion  share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow 
a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is our largest insurance segment  with life premium representing of total premium 
life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
life insurance premium rose to billion in after having increased in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows 
life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term annualized premium in force  net sales  and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any 
table of contents 
index to financial statements given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 
net sales is annualized premium issued  net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue  except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired 
we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued 
first year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   an increase of over billion a year earlier 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december  the following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method 
life insurance net sales by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency other agencies direct response is our leading writer of life insurance 
the direct response operation consists of two primary components direct mail and insert media 
direct mail targets primarily young middle income households with children 
the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders 
parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
at this time  we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance 
we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response s premier markets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements insert media  which targets primarily the adult market  involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media  such as coupon packets  newspapers  bank statements  and billings 
this media was historically placed by direct marketing and advertising distributors  inc dmad  previously an unrelated entity with which we have had a business relationship for fifteen years 
we acquired dmad in january  for million  and integrated their operations during this acquisition allows the company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component 
over the period of our relationship with dmad  the insert media component has grown to the point that it now represents over half of direct response net sales 
however  in the last half of  dmad substantially reduced insert media solicitations resulting in declines in reported net sales in the first half of net sales from insert media are generated four to seven months following the initial sales solicitation 
we believe that the dmad purchase will favorably impact direct response sales going forward 
the direct response operation accounted for of our life insurance premium during  the largest of any distribution group 
direct response s share of total life premium has risen steadily in each of the last three years as illustrated in the chart above 
life premium for this channel rose in and in net sales declined in to million after having risen in to million 
first year collected premium declined in to million but grew in to million 
the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions  but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
life premium for this agency rose to million in  after having increased in net sales increased in to million from million in net sales rose in first year collected premium rose in to million  after having decreased in as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency 
net sales  a lead indicator of new sales  rose in both years and first year collected premium turned positive in after a decline in the american income agent count was  at december  compared with  a year earlier  an increase of 
the agent count rose in from  at year end this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business 
additionally  the systematic  centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middle income customers in southeastern states 
liberty s life premium declined in and in compared with the respective prior year 
liberty s life premium sales  in terms of net sales  were million in  representing a decrease of in net sales also decreased in first year collected premium declined in to million 
first year collected premium declined in growth in the liberty agency s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on building the size of its agency force 
liberty has implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents  primarily through the use of the internet 
the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
liberty s agent count rose to  at december  from  a year earlier 
this compared with a decline of in and an increase of in most of the growth in the agent count occurred in the latter half of the year 
as these new agents become trained and more seasoned  they should become more productive 
declines in net sales in both and were attributable primarily to the declines in agent count 
in  the liberty national agency began the reorganization of its marketing leadership and restructured its agent compensation system to provide greater reward to productive agents and to establish production minimums for agents 
these changes led to terminations and resignations during of agents not meeting these production minimums 
however  management believes that these changes will result in a more productive agency over the long term 
management also believes these changes are responsible for recent margin improvements 
increased sales from a larger and more productive agency force should lead to increased premium growth 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency  the military agency  the united american independent and branch office agencies  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business 
united investors represents approximately of torchmark s life premium income 
the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders 
military premium represents of life premium 
the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately of torchmark s total life premium 
life premium income for these two agencies has declined for the past three years because they focus on health insurance  with life sales being incidental

margin improvement in was primarily the result of premium growth  but favorable mortality was also a positive factor 
this improvement in mortality is not expected to be a trend 
in  the previously mentioned changes in liberty s agent compensation system contributed to increases in liberty s margins  as this new system has reduced acquisition costs at liberty 
additionally  the proportion of american income premium to total premium has grown each year  and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency s margins are torchmark s highest  well exceeding in all periods 
mortality improvement in the military agency was also a major factor in the improvement

index to financial statements health insurance 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited benefit hospital surgical plans  cancer  and accident plans sold to people under age we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program  as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program beginning january  because medicare part d is a significant new health product and there is no comparative prior year data in  medicare part d business will be shown as a separate health component and will be discussed separately in the analysis of the health segment 
health premium represented of torchmark s total premium income in excluding part d premium  health premium represented in  compared with in both and health underwriting margin  excluding part d  accounted for of the total in  compared with of the total in both and these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total united american independent agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement united american branch office agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement liberty national exclusive agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement american income exclusive agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement direct response limited benefit plans medicare supplement total premium before part d limited benefit plans medicare supplement total premium before part d medicare part d total health premium total medicare part d premium and health premium in exclude million of risk sharing premium paid to the centers for medicare and medicaid services consistent with the medicare part d contract 
this risk sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims  and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two united american agencies being our market leaders 
over the past several years  we have placed greater emphasis on the sale of limited benefit health insurance products rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited benefit hospital surgical plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened sales of that product 
while medicare supplement still remains our largest health product in terms of premium income  the premium from other limited benefit health products have been growing rapidly 
as shown in the chart above  medicare supplement premium represented of total health premium excluding part d in  but has declined steadily as a percentage of total health premium in each successive year 
accordingly  limited benefit health products have increased as a percentage of total health premium before part d each year during the same period

the united american branch office and independent agencies 
as discussed above  the two united american agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limited benefit health plans known generally as hospital surgical plans for which demand has increased in recent years 
these plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined  a fixed amount surgical schedule  out patient coverage  and other miscellaneous hospital related charges 
they also contain caps on total per illness benefits 
consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limited benefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement  however  the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates  resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium 
both of the united american agencies offer these limited benefit plans 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the united american branch office is an exclusive agency  meaning the agents in its offices nationwide sell only for us 
in recent years  this agency has been successful in building sales of limited benefit plans to replace the decline in medicare supplement sales 
net sales of limited benefit plans in were million  rising 
in  net sales rose to million 
as a result  total health sales at the ua branch office were million  a increase over  including the decline in medicare supplement sales 
however  in  total net health sales for this agency increased  as a result of the growth in limited benefit sales 
total health premium rose in to million  compared with a increase in to million  taking the decline in the medicare supplement in force block into account 
after growing very rapidly over the past few years  the producing agent count in the ua branch office declined as of december  to  from  in  the producing agent count rose  after growing a year earlier 
as is the case with all of our captive agencies  growing the agency size translates into increased sales and premium growth 
the united american independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large  multi state organizations down to one person offices 
all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies  of which  were active producing agents for torchmark at december  health premium for the ua independent agency declined to million in  after declining in the declines in premium are due to the decreases in medicare supplement premium 
this block of business continues to decline as sales have not compensated for lapses 
this agency s contribution to torchmark s total health sales and premium has declined in each of the past three years 
even though net sales of limited benefit products declined in each of the last three years  each year s new sales have added to premium in force  resulting in the increases in limited benefit premium 
in the recent past  most of this agency s health sales came from one large independent agency 
in  that leading agency s recruiting and training program experienced a disruption that resulted in a decline in producing agents 
the disruption resulted in a drop in net sales 
sales from this agency have not recovered 
liberty national exclusive agency  predominately a life insurance distribution channel  is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected 
cancer supplemental plans are the type of limited benefit health products primarily produced by this agency 
liberty is our only distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product 
liberty s health premium declined in to million after a drop in the declines in premium have resulted from the settlement of a class action lawsuit in early concerning a closed block of cancer business over the timing and size of the premium rate increases on this block 
this block represented approximately half of liberty s cancer business in and approximately at year end prior to  significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this block were a continuing factor causing growth in health premium  but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins 
the settlement provided for reduced benefits paid going forward and further required liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business 
net health sales in the liberty agency for declined to million  compared with net health sales of million 
net health sales were million in one factor in the decline in health sales at liberty has been the increased emphasis on selling the higher margin life products 
another issue had been the decline in agent counts in recent periods  as a result of a change in the agent compensation system in to improve persistency and margins 
however  as a result of recruiting and training initiatives  the agent count rose from  at year end to  at year end  an increase of 
american income exclusive agency  also predominately a life insurance distribution channel  is our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on premium collected 
its health plans are comprised of various limited benefit plans for which almost two thirds of the agency s health premium was from accident policies 
sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 
health premium at this agency for increased to million  while premium of million increased over net health sales were million in  compared with million in and million in net health sales comprised only of the american income agency s total net sales in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements direct response  primarily a life operation  also offers health insurance  which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups 
in  net health sales were million  comprising only of direct response s total life and health net sales 
these net sales rose in  but declined in health premium in for this group rose to million 
health premium in was million  a increase 
medicare part d 
torchmark  through its subsidiary united american  began offering insurance coverage under the government s medicare part d plan as of january  the medicare part d plan is a stand alone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries 
part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american  unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services  where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers are secondary insurers 
the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium 
total medicare part d premium was million in  compared with million in enrollment for all part d coverages ends on december of the previous year  except for enrollees who reach age in the current year 
at december   united american had approximately thousand enrollees for the part d plan 
although final enrollment has not been confirmed  we expect a decline in enrollees for the plan year 
our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation  but is also sold by the two ua agencies 
part d net sales were million in compared with million in  as we count only sales to new first time enrollees in net sales 
the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees 
we believe that the medicare part d program is an excellent addition to our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior age market and with medicare supplements  the government assurances with regard to the risk sharing agreements for participating insurers  the incremental income added to our health insurance margins  and the renewal of the business every year 
our experience with service to the senior age market and use of our direct response marketing system required little new investment to enter this business 
as previously mentioned  we view the medicare part d product separately from our other health products because of its significance and because there are no prior year comparisons with we do not expect significant growth in the part d product in the near future  as most medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan in additionally  as with any government sponsored program  the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

index to financial statements torchmark s health insurance underwriting margin excluding part d before other income and administrative expense increased in to million from million 
in  margin also rose 
as a percentage of premium  underwriting margin increased from in to in  after having risen from in these increases were primarily the result of the reduced loss ratios in the previously mentioned closed block of cancer business at liberty and improvements in american income s loss ratios  especially in liberty s health margins increased million or in  or of health premium

american income s margins rose million to million in and million to million in  of premium in both periods 
annuities 
fixed and variable annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries

we no longer emphasize this segment 
annuities summary of results dollar amounts in thousands policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges based on the average account balances  reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs 
for fixed annuities  net required interest on reserves is the required interest credited to the accounts and is offset by investment income 
for the three periods shown in the chart above  account balances declined  resulting in reductions in policy fees and charges 
accordingly  insurance underwriting margin for annuities before other income and administrative expenses declined in each period and was million in as a percentage of policy charges  margins rose slightly in to but fell to in the decline in margins resulted from increased acquisition costs ratios due to the unlocking of deferred acquisition costs related to guaranteed minimum death benefit business 
we expect higher amortization of acquisition costs going forward 
in all three periods  investment income earned exceeded required interest credited to fixed accounts 
a significant portion of annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements 
this spread results in negative net policy obligations

the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december  operating expenses selected information dollar amounts in thousands amount of prem

insurance administrative expenses salaries other employee costs other administrative expense legal expense medicare part d direct administrative expense total insurance administrative expenses parent company expense stock compensation expense expenses related to settlement of prior period litigation option term extension expense for retiring executive total operating expenses  per consolidated statements of operations insurance administrative expenses increase decrease over prior year total operating expenses increase decrease over prior year insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium declined to in from in and in the decline in the ratio occurred even though legal expense rose million 
a major factor in this increase was the affirmation of an earlier jury verdict in insurance claim litigation in the amount of million 
the increase in legal expense was offset by declines in employee costs other than salaries  and in a million decline in medicare part d direct administrative expense 
one factor in the decline in insurance administrative expense resulted from the previously mentioned changes implemented in liberty s agent compensation system 
these changes resulted in reductions in agent salaries and related employee costs of approximately million in compared with the prior period 
management believes that these salary reductions could be replaced by higher deferred acquisition costs going forward  as the compensation system changes emphasize a commission based agent compensation system rather than salaries 
commissions on new product sales are deferred and amortized over the premium paying life of the business 
the medicare part d administrative costs were lower in because open enrollment was still in effect in until may  causing us to incur additional administrative expense in that year 
open enrollment for the plan year was closed on december  the ratio of expense to premium also declined even after including the million of medicare part d administrative expense for the first time in decreased legal costs were a primary factor  as several ongoing issues were resolved in and parent company expense rose million or in included in expense is a one time charge in the amount of million for expenses incurred related to an acquisition bid that was not successful 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as noted in the summary of operations in this discussion  we settled litigation in connection with liberty s race distinct mortality dual pricing litigation and its class action cancer case in settlement charges and expenses for both cases were recorded in in the amount of million and additional expenses of thousand were recorded in both of these cases arose many years ago 
as previously noted  we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations 
stock compensation expense rose due to a higher fair value assigned to recent grants primarily as a result of the increase in the torchmark stock price  and due to restricted stock granted in late and mid for the first time in several years 
as stated in note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense  and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 
investments 
the investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments  debt and cash flow 
excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations 
it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since implementing our share repurchase program in  we have used billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment

table of contents 
index to financial statements excess investment income increased million or in over the prior year 
excess investment income declined in both and on a per diluted share basis  excess investment income rose to 
per share excess investment income increased in and in the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income  which rose to million in it increased to million in from million in as presented in the following chart  the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 
growth in net investment income growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments made each year at long term yields lower than the portfolio s average yield  resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in recent years 
in  we purchased million of tax exempt municipal securities 
this was another factor in limiting the growth of net investment income relative to average assets  as the yields available on municipal bonds are lower  but produce significant tax savings 
also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio  as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities 
given the sizeable annual cash flow from our operations  we expect mean invested assets to continue to grow  but as long as rates available for new investments do not exceed our portfolio yield  the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure 
more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 
excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt 
information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table

table of contents 
index to financial statements the average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years

for more specific information on life and health crediting rates  please refer to note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income

our senior notes million principal amount matured and our trust preferred securities million redemption value were called in the fourth quarter of these repayments were essentially funded by the issuance of two new instruments in the second quarter of  our senior notes million principal amount and our trust preferred securities million principal amount 
because the new issues were offered several months before the other securities were repaid  interest on funded debt increased million 
it should be noted  however  that we invested the proceeds of the new offerings and the investment income from those proceeds offset the increased financing costs  having little impact on excess investment income 
partially offsetting the decline in interest on funded debt in was an increase in interest on short term debt 
while higher short term rates were a factor  the primary cause of the increase was a higher average balance of our commercial paper outstanding in  which rose to million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements increased short term rates were also a factor in the increase in financing costs  impacting us in two ways 
most notable was the effect that rising short rates had on our interest rate swaps  which we originally entered into to exchange our fixed interest commitments for floating rate commitments 
in the low interest environment experienced in the past several years  these swaps provided us with a considerable spread between our actual interest cost and what our fixed interest cost would have been 
in  short term rates began to rise for the next two years  resulting in significant declines in the benefit of all of our swaps 
because of the possibility that continued rising short term rates could cause our spreads to become negative  we disposed of all swap instruments as of the second quarter of nevertheless  the reduction in positive spreads on settlements from the swaps caused financing costs to increase million in as a result of the dispositions of the swaps  our only exposure to variable rates at december  was our commercial paper borrowing program  of which million was outstanding 
in addition to their impact on our swaps  rising short term rates were also the primary factor in the million increase in interest on our commercial paper borrowings in more information concerning the debt offerings  repayments  and swaps is disclosed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment acquisitions 
during calendar years through  torchmark invested almost exclusively in investment grade fixed maturity securities 
the following chart summarizes selected information for fixed maturity acquisitions in the years through investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust preferred securities which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 
the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield 
this date is commonly known as the worst call date 
for noncallable bonds  the worst call date is always the maturity date 
for callable bonds  the worst call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield or the maturity date  if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date 
two different average life calculations are shown  average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date 
fixed maturity acquisitions selected information dollar amounts in millions for the year cost of acquisitions investment grade corporate securities tax exempt municipal securities other investment grade securities total fixed maturity acquisitions effective annual yield one year compounded average life in years  to next call average life in years to maturity average rating a a a tax equivalent basis  whereby the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities 
when yields available on acceptable quality long term maturity date more than years after the acquisition date securities are sufficient to meet our yield and spread objectives  we generally prefer to invest in such securities because they more closely match the long term nature of our policy liabilities 
during periods when we cannot invest in long term securities that meet our objectives  we generally invest in shorter term maturity date less than years after the acquisition date securities 
we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a make whole basis prior to maturity 
we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so 
for investments in callable bonds  the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not and if so  when the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date 
given our investments in callable 
table of contents 
index to financial statements bonds  the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment 
we do know that the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity 
data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 
during  especially during  there have been periods when yields available on acceptable quality long term non callable securities did not meet our objectives 
during such periods  we have invested in shorter term securities 
some of these periods were characterized by relatively flat or inverted yield curves 
during such periods  we did not have to give up much yield to invest in shorter term securities  and we took on less credit risk than had we invested longer term 
prior to  we generally did not invest in securities with maturity dates more than years after the acquisition date 
during  we invested some funds in hybrid securities bonds  trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with very long scheduled maturity dates  often exceeding years 
in virtually all cases  such hybrid securities are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date 
as shown in the chart above  the effective annual yield and average life to maturity on funds invested during is significantly lower than that of funds invested during and this difference is reflective of the fact that  consistent with the investment environment and strategy described above  we invested relatively more funds in lower yielding  shorter term investments in than we did in due primarily to our investments in hybrid securities as described above  the average life of funds invested during to both next call and maturity is significantly higher than that of investments during given the long term fixed rate characteristics of our policy liabilities  we believe that investments with average lives in excess of years are appropriate 
new cash flow available to us for investment was affected by issuer calls as a result of the low interest environment experienced during the past three years 
issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost 
calls increase funds available for investment  but they can negatively affect portfolio yield if they cause us to replace higher yielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields 
issuer calls were million in  million in  and million in as long as we continue our current investment strategy and the average yield on new investments is less than the average yield of the portfolio and of assets disposed of  the average yield on fixed maturity assets in the portfolio should decline 
because of the significant investable cash flow generated from investments and operations  torchmark will benefit if yield rates available on new investments increase 
portfolio analysis 
because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms 
the following table presents a comparison of torchmark s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december  with the latest industry data 
torchmark amount in millions industry bonds preferred stock redeemable and perpetual common stocks mortgage loans real estate policy loans other invested assets short terms latest data available from the american council of life insurance

table of contents 
index to financial statements additional information concerning the fixed maturity portfolio is as follows

torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixed maturity portfolio two ways a based on the next call date which is the next call date for callable bonds and the maturity date for noncallable bonds  and b based on the maturity date of all bonds  whether callable or not 
effective duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to a particular change in interest rates 
at the end of and  the fixed maturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of million and million  respectively 
gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
please see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an analysis of unrealized investment losses 
credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
we mitigate this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring investment grade bonds  and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
at december   approximately of invested assets at fair value were held in fixed maturity securities 
the major rating agencies considered of this portfolio to be investment grade 
the average quality rating of the portfolio is a 
the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio at fair value as of december  rating amounts in millions aaa aa a bbb bb b less than b not rated our current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  any increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we additionally reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the industry sectors that exceeded of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio at fair value at december  industry insurance carriers depository institutions electric  gas  sanitation services nondepository credit institutions finance oil gas extraction communications chemicals allied products food kindred products security commodity brokers transportation equipment petroleum refining related industries media otherwise  no individual industry represented more than of torchmark s corporate fixed maturities 
we have no direct investment exposure to subprime or alt a mortgages loans for which the credit score was acceptable but some of the typical documentation was not provided 
we have no derivatives or any other off balance sheet investment arrangements  as all of our investments are carried on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have million at fair value million book value invested in collateralized debt obligations cdos for which the average bloomberg composite rating at december  was a 
the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies  and no subprime or alt a mortgages are included in the collateral 
market risk sensitivity 
the primary market risk to which torchmark s financial securities are exposed is interest rate risk  meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
since the portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments  it is highly subject to market risk 
declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value 
however  we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity 
the long term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio 
the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio 
however  in accordance with gaap  these liabilities are not marked to market 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  realized gains and losses 
our life and health insurance carriers collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  we also incur acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
because our investment portfolio is large and diverse  investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
we do not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield  or which result from events that are beyond our control  are only secondary to the core insurance operation of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
unlike investment income  realized gains and losses are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of our insurance products 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  and as a result  can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period to period trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations 
for these reasons  and in line with industry practice  we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

in  we wrote down certain non financial institution holdings to estimated fair value as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met some or all of our criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our critical accounting policies in this report 
the pretax charge for this impairment was million million after tax 
at the time of impairment  these securities were carried at a value of million 
later during  a portion of these securities were sold for proceeds of million  with the remainder held at december  valued at million 
as discussed in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we redeemed our trust preferred securities in  recording a pretax loss of million million after tax 
additionally in  we repurchased with the intent to retire million principal amount of our notes  recording a pretax loss of thousand thousand after tax 
in years prior to  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  swapping our fixed rate commitments on our long term debt for floating rate commitments 
accounting rules required us to value our interest rate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period  recording changes as a component of realized investment gains losses 
because the fair values of these instruments fluctuated with interest rates in financial markets and diminished with time  we never considered these fluctuations in managing ongoing operations 
as explained earlier under the caption investments  the outlook for short term rate increases in late and the expectation of even greater short term rate increases in could have caused the spreads on our swaps to become unprofitable in the future 
therefore  we sold two of our swaps in the third quarter of and the remaining two swaps in the second quarter of  so that no swaps were held after june  complete information on our swaps  including the accounting policies  is found in note significant accounting policies and in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
our liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
our insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs 
sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers  such as torchmark  expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods  sometimes many years later 
an actuarially computed reserve is carried in the financial statements for these future benefits 
earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period  but there is no corresponding cash outlay 
therefore  cash provided from operations is generally expected to exceed net income 
cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of the investment portfolio 
cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy back torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and for other corporate uses 
cash flows provided from operations were million in  million in  and million in in addition  we received billion in investment maturities  repayments  and calls in  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in we have in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  our strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as fully described and discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark had outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities at both december  and the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the trust is an off balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules 
deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest 
therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity  even though we own all of the entity s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity s performance 
while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark s junior subordinated debentures due to the trust 
these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of million par and book value at both december  and these securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report 
the preferred dividends 
table of contents 
index to financial statements due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our interest payment on our debt to the trusts 
as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 
pension obligations to our employees primarily are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on our balance sheet 
the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due 
the difference in our pension obligations and the fair value of the assets which fund those obligations are included on our balance sheets 
as of december   we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities other than as described above 
all of our guarantees  other than the trust preferred guarantee  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 
the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  amounts in millions actual liability total payments less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years fixed and determinable long term debt principal long term debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations uncertain tax positions future insurance obligations total interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations 
pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are offset by invested assets funding the trusts 
therefore  our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities 
the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations  except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
uncertain tax positions include million of tax liability and million of accrued interest 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at december  these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown 
management believes that the assets supporting the liability of billion at december   along with future premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark s capital trusts which are liable for its trust preferred securities 
in accordance with gaap  these instruments are included in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
a complete analysis and description of long term debt issues outstanding is presented in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
during the second quarter of  we registered and issued two new security offerings our trust preferred securities  offered through torchmark capital trust iii at a redemption value of million less issue expenses  and our senior notes issued for the principal amount of million less issue expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we redeemed our trust preferred securities and we repaid our senior notes which matured 
the trust preferreds were redeemed for million plus accrued dividends and our senior notes were repaid in the principal amount of million plus accrued interest 
specific information about the new securities offered and the securities repaid in  including the uses of proceeds and sources of funding  is disclosed and discussed in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
over the past several years  we have entered into swap agreements to exchange the fixed rate commitments on our funded debt for floating rate commitments 
during the low interest rate environment in recent years  these swaps were very beneficial in reducing our interest cost  as discussed under the captions investments excess investment income and realized gains and losses in this report 
as short term rates rose in and with no meaningful change in long term rates  these swaps became less profitable 
because we believed that the swap settlements could have possibly become unprofitable  we disposed of these agreements during and and held no swap agreements after june information about the history of our swaps is found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption interest rate swaps 
in the second quarter of  we executed a voluntary stock option exercise and restoration program in which directors  employees and consultants exercised vested options in torchmark s common stock and received a lesser number of new options at the current market price 
as a result  we issued million new shares to the participants 
however  a substantial number of the new shares were immediately sold through the open market by the participants to cover the option exercise price of their new shares and their related income taxes 
as a result of the program  management s ownership in torchmark increased and the company received a significant tax benefit from the exercise of the options 
we received million in proceeds for the exercise price and million in tax benefits  both of which added to shareholder s equity 
however  as previously mentioned  we generally use the proceeds of option exercises to repurchase shares on the open market to reduce the dilution caused by option exercises 
as a result  the total impact on shareholder s equity and cash flow from the transaction was immaterial 
more information on stock options and this program is found in note significant accounting policies and in note stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the most beneficial use of our excess cash flow could be a strategic acquisition 
absent an acquisition  we believe that the best use of excess cash is to buy company stock 
as previously mentioned  our board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase program in july  in amounts and timing that management  in consultation with the board  determined to be in the best interest of the company 
we have repurchased common stock every year since  except for  the year following the acquisition of american income 
since the beginning of  we have repurchased million shares at a total cost of billion  and have acquired no fewer than million shares in any one year 
we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings  return on equity  and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value 
as noted earlier in this report  we acquired over million shares at a cost of million in with excess cash flow 
if the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds  an estimated million of additional investment income  after tax  would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased to 
because share purchases were made  actual net income per share was  an increase of 
we intend to continue the repurchase of our common shares when prices are favorable 
the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 
we maintain a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities 
accounting rule sfas requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio result primarily from changes in interest rates in financial markets 
while sfas requires invested assets to be revalued  accounting rules do not permit 
table of contents 
index to financial statements interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner 
due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of our shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
for this reason  our management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas when analyzing our balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios

as discussed under the caption new unadopted accounting policies in this report  the fasb has issued a new statement offering an option which  if elected  would permit us to value our interest bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available for sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income  the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings 
because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt  the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile  causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results 
therefore  we will not elect this option 
torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was times in  compared with times in  and times in a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 
credit ratings 
the credit quality of torchmark s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies 
during  standard poor s lowered its credit rating on torchmark s outstanding debt from a to a  and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from a to bbb 
the credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity  recruiting  and retention  as well as changes in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements direct response strategy  all of which has contributed to lower new sales 
during  am best downgraded torchmark s funded debt one notch from a to a  and its preferred stock from a to bbb 
moody s downgraded our funded debt from a to baa  and our preferred stock from baa to baa both downgrades were to reflect the notching  or widening of rating levels between the insurance companies and their parent company which has issued the debt 
this notching is typical for these rating agencies as they rate other insurance companies 
it does not reflect any change in the creditworthiness of the company 
the chart below presents torchmark s credit ratings as of december  standard poors fitch moody s am best commercial paper a f p amb funded debt a a baa a preferred stock bbb a baa bbb the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard poor s and am best

the am best a excellent rating is assigned to those companies which  in its opinion  have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the life health insurance industry 
a excellent companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard poor s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the minus sign shows the relative standing within the major rating category 
the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics  somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings 
transactions with related parties information regarding related party transactions is found in note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information 
table of contents 
index to financial statements presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material 
for more information concerning litigation  please refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
new unadopted accounting rules the fasb has issued certain new standards applicable to torchmark  effective in future periods fair value measurements statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas  clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a single framework or a hierarchy for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it does not change which assets or liabilities are measured at fair value 
accordingly  it is not expected to have a significant impact on torchmark s financial position 
however  new disclosures of fair value measurement methodology and effects will be required 
the statement is effective for torchmark in the calendar year and interim periods of  with its provisions applied prospectively 
please refer to the discussion of valuation of fixed maturities under the caption critical accounting policies in this report for more information related to this new unadopted statement 
fair value option statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  was issued in february  this statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value which are otherwise measured on a different basis in existing literature 
additional disclosures are required 
if elected  it is effective as of january  this statement would provide us with the opportunity to carry our interest bearing policy liabilities and debt as well as our invested assets at market value  with changes reflected in earnings 
the size of this unrealized adjustment to earnings in relation to net income each period could be considerable and very volatile  causing our earnings not to be reflective of core results  historical patterns  or predictive of future earnings trends 
therefore  we will not elect to adopt this statement 
business combinations statement no 
r  business combinations sfas r  replaces the previous accounting guidance for the acquisition of other companies 
it retains the purchase method of accounting and the current guidance with respect to the accounting for indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill 
however  the new statement provides certain significant differences  most notably that all assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value as of the acquisition date rather than a cost allocation approach as previously required 
additionally  all expenses of the acquisition are charged off as incurred rather than capitalized 
this statement is effective for torchmark as of january  in the event there is an acquisition dated subsequent to that date 
noncontrolling interests statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  changes the accounting for noncontrolling interests also known as minority interests 
at this time  torchmark has no noncontrolling interests 
critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefit reserves 

table of contents 
index to financial statements approximately of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december  are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas  under which the liability is the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits 
the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue 
under sfas  these assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts  except where there is a premium deficiency  as defined in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits 
otherwise  variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 
a premium deficiency event for torchmark s sfas business is very rare  and did not occur during the three years ended december  the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business reported under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments sfas 
under sfas  the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date 
accordingly  there are no assumptions used in the determination of the sfas future policy benefit liability 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased as indicated in note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december  are accounted for under the provisions of sfas for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums 
the projection assumptions for sfas business are set at the time of contract issue 
under sfas  these assumptions are locked in at that time and  except where there is a loss recognition issue  are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume 
we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for our sfas assets for any period in the three years ended december  the remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to business reported under sfas for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits 
these contracts are not subject to lock in 
under sfas  the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
for the three years ended december   revisions related to our sfas assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  and based on the nature of our operations  are not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation  the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation 
at this time  we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 
revenue recognition 
premium income from our subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenue on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as our annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
we report investment income as revenue  less investment expenses  when it is earned 
our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products 
for more information concerning revenue recognition  investment accounting  and interest sensitivity  please refer to note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities  investments  and market risk sensitivity in this report 
valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in high quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time 
while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity  they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time  primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards 
we report this portfolio at fair value 
fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets  having a greater impact on longer term maturities 
because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio  small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company 
this impact is disclosed in basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report 
however  as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report  we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and  as such  we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 
the fair value of approximately of our fixed maturity portfolio is established by quoted prices for these assets in an active market  considered level inputs in the hierarchy described by the recently issued but unadopted sfas the fair value of approximately of the portfolio is determined by observable inputs other than direct quotes  considered as level inputs by sfas these inputs generally include quoted closing market prices for similar assets in active markets  such quotes in inactive markets  or interest rates and yield curves observable under commonly quoted criteria 
the remaining of the portfolio is valued by unobservable inputs  or level inputs in accordance with sfas unobservable inputs include data for which there is limited market information causing us to rely on values derived by independent brokers or internally developed assumptions 
these values are established based on the best information available to us or the other parties 
impairment of investments 
we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value  whereby fair value has declined below carrying value 
while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset  at least in part  by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
at december   our net liability under these plans was million 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans 
while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  we cannot assure that actual results will be the same as expected 
our discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to us 
note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  and other related data 
cautionary statements we caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this document  and in any other statements made by us or on our behalf whether or not in future filings with the securities and exchange commission 
any statement that is not a historical fact  or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning us or our business  whether express or implied  is meant as and should be considered a forward looking statement 
such statements represent our opinions concerning future operations  strategies  financial results or other developments 
forward looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
if these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect  the actual results may differ materially from the forward looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions 
whether or not actual results differ materially from forward looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments  which may be national in scope  related to the insurance industry generally  or applicable to torchmark specifically 
such events or developments could include  but are not necessarily limited to changes in lapse rates and or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality  morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions  federal and state legislative and regulatory developments  particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal medicare program that would affect medicare supplement and medicare part d insurance  market trends in the senior aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare  such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans  and that could affect the sales of traditional medicare supplement insurance
