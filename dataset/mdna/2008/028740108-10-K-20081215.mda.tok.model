our company we are a leading manufacturer of fine and specialty chemicals within our focused markets 
our fine chemicals products are used by our customers to make drugs  primarily those with anti viral  oncology and central nervous system indications 
our specialty chemicals and aerospace equipment products are utilized in national defense programs and provide access to  and movement in  space  via solid and liquid propellant rockets and propulsion thrusters 
our technical and manufacturing expertise and customer service focus has gained us a reputation for quality  reliability  technical performance and innovation 
given the mission critical nature of our products  we maintain long standing strategic customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop customized solutions that meet rigorous federal and other international regulatory standards 
we generally sell our products through long term contracts under which we are the sole source or limited source supplier 
we are the only north american producer of ammonium perchlorate ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
in order to diversify our business and leverage our strong technical and manufacturing capabilities  we have made two strategic acquisitions in recent years 
each of these acquisitions provided long term customer relationships with sole source and limited source contracts and leadership positions in growing markets 
on october   we acquired the former atlantic research corporation s liquid in space propulsion business isp from aerojet general corporation  which is now our aerospace equipment segment 
our aerospace equipment segment is one of two major north american manufacturers of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites  launch vehicles  and interceptors 
on november   we acquired the fine chemicals business of gencorp inc gencorp  which is now our fine chemicals segment 
our fine chemicals segment is a leading custom manufacturer of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients and registered intermediates for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 

table of contents our business segments our operations comprise four reportable business segments i fine chemicals  ii specialty chemicals  iii aerospace equipment and iv other businesses 
the following table reflects the revenue contribution percentage from our business segments and each of their major product lines for the years ended september fine chemicals specialty chemicals perchlorates sodium azide halotron total specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses real estate water treatment equipment total other businesses total revenues less than fine chemicals 
on november   we acquired the fine chemicals business of gencorp the afc business through our newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary ampac fine chemicals llc afc 
our fine chemicals segment is a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and registered intermediates 
the pharmaceutical ingredients that we manufacture are used by our customers in drugs with applications in three primary areas anti viral  oncology  and central nervous system 
we generate nearly all of our fine chemicals sales from manufacturing chemical compounds that are proprietary to our customers 
we operate in compliance with the us food and drug administration s the fda current good manufacturing practices or cgmp and other regulatory agencies such as the european union s european medicines agency emea 
our fine chemicals segment s strategy is to focus on high growth markets where our technological position  combined with our chemical process  development and engineering expertise  leads to strong customer allegiances and limited competition 
we have distinctive competencies and specialized engineering capabilities in performing chiral separations  manufacturing highly potent including cytotoxic products  and performing energetic and nucleoside nucleotide chemistries at commercial scale 
we have invested significant resources in our facilities and technology base 
we believe we are the us leader in performing chiral separations using commercial scale simulated moving bed smb technology and own and operate two large scale smb machines  both of which are among the largest in the world operating under cgmp 
we have distinctive competency in handling highly toxic chemicals using our specialized high containment facilities in applications such as drugs used for oncology 
we have significant experience and specially engineered facilities for energetic chemistry on a commercial scale under cgmp 
we use this capability in development and production of products such as those used in anti viral drugs  including hiv related and influenza combating drugs 
we have established long term  sole source and limited source contracts  which help provide us with earnings stability and visibility 
in addition  the inherent nature of custom pharmaceutical fine chemicals manufacturing encourages stable  long term customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop reliable  safe and cost effective  custom solutions 
once a custom manufacturer has been qualified as a supplier on a cgmp product  there are several potential barriers that discourage transferring the manufacturing method to an alternative supplier  including the following alternative supply may not be readily available 
we are currently the sole source supplier on several of our fine chemicals products 

table of contents regulatory approval 
applications to and approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities generally require the chemical contractor to be named 
switching contractors may require additional regulatory approval and could take as long as six months to two years 
significant financial costs 
switching contractors and amending various filings can result in significant costs associated with technology transfer  process validation and re filing with the fda and other regulatory authorities 
specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals segment is principally engaged in the production of ap 
in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  a chemical used in pharmaceutical manufacturing  and halotron  a series of clean fire extinguishing agents used in fire extinguishing products ranging from portable fire extinguishers to total flooding systems 
we have supplied ap for use in space and defense programs for over years and we have been the only ap supplier in north america since a significant number of existing and planned space launch vehicles use solid propellant and thus depend  in part  upon our ap 
many of the rockets and missiles used in national defense programs are also powered by solid propellants 
for fiscal  our largest programs were the minuteman iii propulsion replacement program  the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motor rsrm  the guided multiple launch rocket system gmlrs missile and the ares next generation space exploration vehicles 
alliant techsystems inc or atk is our largest ap customer 
we sell grade i ap to atk under a long term contract that requires us to maintain a ready and qualified capacity for grade i ap and that requires atk to purchase its grade i ap requirements from us  subject to certain terms and conditions 
the contract  which expires in  provides fixed pricing in the form of a price volume matrix for annual grade i ap volumes ranging from million to million pounds 
pricing varies inversely to volume and includes annual escalations 
aerospace equipment 
on october   we acquired the former atlantic research corporation s liquid in space propulsion business isp from aerojet general corporation  which is now our aerospace equipment segment 
our aerospace equipment segment is one of two major north american manufacturers of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites  launch vehicles  and interceptors 
our products are utilized on various satellite and launch vehicle programs such as space systems loral s series geostationary satellites 
our aerospace equipment segment is expected to grow over the next several years as a result of our customer relationships  competitive pricing and focus on technologies 
growth areas should include missile defense programs  the commercial satellite segment  space exploration and launch vehicles 
other businesses 
our other businesses segment contains our water treatment equipment and real estate activities 
our water treatment equipment business designs  manufactures and markets systems for the control of noxious odors  the disinfection of water streams and the treatment of seawater 
our real estate activities are not material 
discontinued operations 
we also held a ownership stake in energetic systems  inc esi  an entity we consolidated under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  that manufactured and distributed commercial explosives 
in june  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plan to sell our interest in esi  based on our determination that esi s product lines were no longer a strategic fit with our business strategies 
revenues  expenses and cash flows associated with esi s operations are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
esi was formerly reported within our specialty chemicals segment 
effective september   we completed the sale of our interest in esi for  which  after deducting direct expenses  resulted in a gain on the sale before income taxes of

fine chemicals specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total revenues fine chemicals 
we acquired our fine chemicals segment on november   two months after the beginning of fiscal fine chemicals segment revenues increased  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by increased volume for anti viral products 
specifically  the volume for our largest measured in terms of revenues anti viral product increased by to support our customer s increase in safety stock inventory of the final drug 
volume for our second largest anti viral product increased by in support of increases in demand for our customer s end product 
volume for our largest oncology product declined in fiscal because fiscal included additional quantities purchased by our customer to build on hand safety stock quantities 
fine chemicals segment revenues increased  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the acquisition of the afc business was effective october   fine chemicals segment revenues increased from pro forma revenues of  in fiscal to  in fiscal  representing organic growth 
overall  the pro forma fine chemicals segment revenue growth is driven primarily by additional volumes for our anti viral products almost entirely in the hiv related area 
fine chemicals segment revenues are anticipated to decline in fiscal by approximately as compared to fiscal the expected decline reflects an approximately reduction in volume for the anti viral product that was our largest product in fiscal the fiscal decline in volume for this product is due to our customer s supply chain strategy and their desire to reduce their current levels of inventory 
over the longer term  we believe that the pharmaceutical fine chemicals market will continue to present growth opportunities 
the trend toward more outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry continues and afc s pipeline of new products continues to grow 
we believe that the key to enabling our growth in this segment is investment through strategic acquisitions and to a lesser extent investment in our facilities 
specialty chemicals 
specialty chemicals segment revenues include revenues from our perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron product lines  with perchlorates comprising   and of specialty chemicals revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year over year variances in specialty chemicals revenues reflect the following factors a increase in perchlorate volume in fiscal and a decline in the related average price per pound 
a increase in grade i ap volume in fiscal and a increase in the related average price per pound 
sodium azide revenues decreased in fiscal and in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
halotron revenues increased in fiscal and in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 

table of contents for fiscal  our largest programs were the minuteman iii propulsion replacement program  the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motor rsrm  the gmlrs missile and the ares next generation space exploration vehicles 
the average price per pound of perchlorate sold in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal due to higher total sales volume of grade i ap in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  the increase in perchlorate volume is generally distributed equally among the various solid rocket motor propulsion programs for which we supply ap 
there are numerous variations of grade i ap that we produce for our customers 
the average price per pound of grade i ap sold in fiscal increased compared to fiscal because a greater percentage of the volume related to specialized blends of grade i ap which are sold at higher unit prices than others 
we expect grade i ap demand in fiscal to be less than fiscal  primarily due to the completion of the three year minuteman iii propulsion replacement program 
the expected decline in volume is not expected to have a corresponding effect on revenues due to the pricing under our contractual price volume matrix 
over the longer term  we expect annual demand for grade i ap to be within the range of million to million pounds based on current nasa and us department of defense production programs 
however  ap demand could increase if there is a substantial increase in space shuttle flights 
in addition  grade i ap revenues are typically derived from a relatively few large orders 
as a result  quarterly revenue amounts can vary significantly depending on the timing of individual orders throughout the year 
average price per pound may continue to fluctuate somewhat in future periods  depending upon product mix and volume 
the decrease in sodium azide revenues in fiscal and reflects a continued reduction in demand for sodium azide used in pharmaceutical applications 
we do not anticipate a significant increase in demand for sodium azide 
increases in halotron revenues are driven by volume changes which have been and are expected to be consistent year over year 
aerospace equipment 
our aerospace equipment segment reflects the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiary ampac isp corp 
isp 
aerospace equipment segment revenues declined in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decline is primarily due to the awards of new contracts occurring in the later part of fiscal  and accordingly did not produce as much revenue within fiscal fiscal aerospace equipment segment contract awards include a contract to develop a liquid divert and attitude control system dacs for the ballistic missile defense system 
the work will apply proven component and subsystem design to develop a modular and scalable dacs 
the program will leverage isp s design for manufacturing experience to develop a low cost  low risk propulsion system for interceptor kill vehicles 
the cost plus fixed fee contract  of approximately  is anticipated to culminate in the delivery of a qualification unit and two flight test units in september isp is teamed with moog inc space and defense group  east aurora  new york  which will provide subsystem design and component support 
initial funding from general dynamics advanced information systems to initiate the landsat data continuity mission ldcm contract 
the expected value of the contract is approximately  to deliver a propulsion system for the landsat satellite 
this satellite is funded by nasa goddard and provides earth observation for land and water resource planning 
a contract by microsat systems to provide propulsion systems to be used on the orbcomm og program 
the initial multimillion dollar contract for systems also has an option for another systems 
orbcomm satellites provide gps data for tracking and global satellite data communications 
aerospace equipment revenues for fiscal were consistent with the prior fiscal year 
the fiscal revenues reflect several months of lower volume related to the timing of orders from isp s largest customer 
with respect to this customer  isp completed production under a multi year contract in may 
table of contents production on a follow on order began in august as a result  revenues in fiscal were reduced by the lag time between orders 
conversely  revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased compared to the prior year quarter reflecting production associated with the aforementioned order 
during fiscal  our aerospace equipment segment spent substantial bid and proposal costs and efforts for the nasa crew launch vehicle clv program and continued our push into propulsion systems 
our efforts bidding propulsion systems are anticipated not only to affect future commercial programs but also military programs  one of which we are under contract for the first phase and in consideration with respect to the second phase 
other businesses 
other businesses segment revenues include pepcon systems water treatment equipment and related spare parts sales and real estate revenues 
water treatment equipment sales increased in fiscal and  in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal years 
the revenue increases were driven by new system sales 
cost of revenues and gross margin year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
revenues cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage in addition to the factors detailed below  one of the most significant factors that affects  and should continue to affect  the comparison of our consolidated gross margins from period to period is the change in revenue mix between our two largest segments because our specialty chemicals segment typically has higher gross margins than our fine chemicals segment 
measured in terms of revenues  specialty chemicals accounted for  and of our operations during fiscal  and  respectively 
fine chemicals has grown as a percentage of total revenues  comprising  and of consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage declined to compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the following factors affect our fiscal consolidated gross margin comparisons fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage for the fiscal declined five points compared to the prior fiscal year  reflecting the following o our product mix changed such that fiscal contained a greater percentage of lower margin products than fiscal o during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a new process for a large volume anti viral product and experienced start up difficulties 
this negatively impacted margins 
while we have made progress toward our expectations for the new process  the effects are expected to continue into the early part of fiscal specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved approximately eight points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year  reflecting the following o mid fiscal second quarter  the specialty chemicals segment completed the amortization of the value assigned to the perchlorate customer list acquired in fiscal this reduction in amortization expense improved the specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage by four points for fiscal o the remaining improvement in the specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage reflects better absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to the higher production volume in fiscal aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage was the same in fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage improved to compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the following factors affect our fiscal consolidated gross margin comparisons fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage for fiscal improved two points compared to the prior fiscal year because of a change in product mix and the effect of several continuous improvement projects 
specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved approximately four points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily because the higher volumes and average selling price per pound in fiscal resulted in improved coverage of fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage improved approximately five points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year largely due to fiscal activity including more standard production thruster work compared to the prior fiscal year which included a greater volume of development activities 
operating expenses year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
operating expenses percentage of revenues operating expenses increased  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily attributed to a decrease in fine chemicals segment operating expenses including a decrease in incentive compensation of offset partially by an increase in recruiting and personnel relocation expenses of a decrease in specialty chemicals segment operating expenses due to various individually insignificant changes in general and administrative expenses 
a increase in aerospace equipment segment operating expenses due to various individually insignificant changes in staffing and marketing expenses 
an increase in corporate operating expenses including increases in supplemental executive retirement expenses of  rent of  and legal and professional services of operating expenses increased  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily attributed to a net increase in fine chemicals operating expenses of  primarily because fiscal included twelve months of operations compared to ten months of operations in the prior fiscal year 
a decrease of  in amortization expense related to afc intangible assets 
an increase of  for incentive compensation at our specialty chemicals segment and corporate operations due to improved performance in fiscal an increase of due to sarbanes oxley compliance costs and related additional audit fees 
a decrease of in corporate severance costs 
in fiscal we recorded a charge for related to a settlement with the company s former chief financial officer 
environmental remediation charges 
during fiscal  we recorded an environmental remediation charge of  reflecting an increase in our total cost estimate of probable costs for the construction phase of a henderson  nevada groundwater remediation facility

environmental remediation charges  corporate general and administrative costs and interest are not allocated to segment operating results 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
fluctuations in segment operating profit are driven by changes in segment revenues  gross margins and operating expenses  each of which is discussed in greater detail above 
during fiscal  we revised our method to measure segment operating results to a method management believes is a more meaningful measure of segment performance 
effective january   general corporate expenses are not allocated to our operating segments 
effective april   environmental remediation charges are not allocated to our operating segments 
other environmental related costs  such as evaluation and on going compliance at our various facilities continue to be allocated to segment results 
prior to these effective dates  we had included an allocation of corporate expenses to our operating segments and environmental remediation charges were allocated to our specialty chemicals segment 
all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect our current method to measure segment operating results 
backlog agreements with our fine chemicals segment customers typically include multi year supply agreements 
these agreements may contain provisional order volumes  minimum order quantities  take or pay provisions  termination fees and other customary terms and conditions  which we do not include in our computation of backlog 
fine chemicals segment backlog includes unfulfilled firm purchase orders received from a customer  including both purchase orders which are issued against a related supply agreement and stand alone purchase orders 
fine chemicals segment backlog was approximately  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we anticipate backlog as of september  to be filled during fiscal the decrease in fine chemicals segment backlog at september  as compared to september  reflects the timing of customer purchase orders against related supply agreements 
our aerospace equipment segment is a government contractor  and accordingly  total backlog includes both funded backlog contracts for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog contracts for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer 
we compute backlog as the total contract value less revenues that have been recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
aerospace equipment segment total backlog and funded backlog were  and  respectively  as of september  compared to both total and funded backlog of  as of september  we anticipate funded backlog as of september  to be substantially filled during fiscal this increase in aerospace equipment segment total backlog is largely due to the aforementioned contracts awarded in fiscal backlog is not a meaningful measure for our other business lines

interest and other income interest income gain on sale of assets total interest and other expense debt repayment charges we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income varies with these balances 
in october  we sold our one third interest in an office building located in las vegas  nevada and concurrently renewed our lease with the buyer to lease a floor in the same building 
the transaction was accounted for as a sale leaseback 
the transaction resulted in a total gain of  of which we deferred  representing the present value of future lease payments and recognized a gain on sale of assets in the amount of  which was reported as a component of other income in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal we amortized the deferred gain as a reduction of rental expense  using the straight line method through april in may  we terminated our lease and relocated our offices to different leased space 
the unamortized sale leaseback gain  in the amount of  was recognized as a component of other income in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our refinancing activities in february which reduced the average interest rate on our long term debt to 
prior to our refinancing  our variable rate long term debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because our long term debt  which was issued in connection with the acquisition of our fine chemicals segment  was outstanding for months in fiscal compared to months in fiscal debt repayment charges are associated with the aforementioned refinancing activities which are discussed in further detail below under the heading long term debt and revolving credit facilities 
income taxes 
our income tax expense benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes  amounts that were expensed for book purposes that are not deductible for income tax purposes  changes in our valuation allowances  and other adjustments to our estimates of tax liabilities 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax benefit rate is as follows for the years ended september federal income tax at the statutory rate state income tax  net of federal benefit nondeductible expenses valuation allowance change in effective state income tax rate interest and penalties basis differences in partnerships other effective tax rate 
table of contents as of september  and  we had federal operating loss carryforwards  and  respectively  available to reduce future federal taxable income  expiring in as of september  and  respectively  we have aggregate operating loss carryforwards of  and  for certain us states and  and  for the united kingdom uk 
we do not anticipate future taxable income in these states or the uk  and accordingly have provided valuation allowances of and as of september  and  respectively 
we have not provided a us federal income tax benefit for the uk because we intend to permanently reinvest any earnings from the uk liquidity and capital resources cash flows year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash for period operating activities fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash flows from operating activities decreased by  significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include a decrease in cash due to a decline in cash profits generated by our operations of  an improvement in cash used to fund working capital increases of  excluding the effect of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash taxes paid of  an increase in cash used for interest payments of  a reduction in cash used for environmental remediation of other decreases in cash used for operating activities of cash used by working capital accounts improved during fiscal primarily due to reductions in inventory levels  primarily at afc 
the benefit to cash from reductions in inventory levels was partially offset by reductions in accrued liabilities and deferred revenues 
we consider these working capital changes to be routine and within the normal production cycle of our products 
the production and sales process of certain fine chemicals products  beginning with the procurement of raw materials  and running through the production  testing  release  and payment from customer  requires a length of time that exceeds one quarter 
therefore  in any given quarter  work in progress inventory or deferred revenues can increase or decrease significantly 
we expect that our working capital may vary normally by as much as  from quarter to quarter 
cash tax payments have increased due to the improvement in our pre tax income and the negative effects of tax basis inventory adjustments 
cash used for interest increased primarily due to the timing of our interest payments 
our current debt instruments require semi annual interest payments in february and august compared to the debt instruments in place through february which required interest payments at the end of each quarter 
cash used for environmental remediation decreased because during the fiscal first quarter we were in the construction phase of our henderson  nevada remediation project compared to the lower cash requirements of the operating and maintenance phase which began in the fiscal second quarter 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash flows from operating activities improved by  significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include an increase in cash due to improved profitability of our operations of  an increase in cash used to fund working capital increases of  excluding the effect of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash taxes paid of  an increase in cash used for interest payments of  including payments totaling for the early payment and termination of our second lien credit facility in february described below in long term debt and revolving credit facilities 
a reduction in cash used for environmental remediation of  other increases in cash used for operating activities of  cash used to fund working capital increases was generally consistent between fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  an increase in cash used to fund inventory increases of  was offset by cash provided by decreases in accounts receivable balances 
payments of cash taxes increased primarily due to state income taxes in california and new york 
cash used for interest increased primarily due to the change in our debt structure discussed below 
in fiscal  a significant portion of our debt included payment in kind or pik interest which effectively increased outstanding principal amounts without making cash payments for interest 
conversely  in fiscal  our senior notes as defined under long term debt and revolving credit facilities below required cash interest payments semi annually 
cash used for environmental remediation decreased because during fiscal we were in the construction phase of the project compared to the lower cash requirements of the operating and maintenance phase which began in fiscal investing activities fiscal compared to fiscal capital expenditures increased by  the increase includes an increase in capital expenditures at our corporate offices of  primarily due to the relocation of our headquarters and an increase in capital expenditures by our fine chemicals segment that included the upgrade of an existing production line to better handle new projects and the installation of equipment in support of a long term project

table of contents financing activities financing cash flows for fiscal primarily reflect capital lease payments and cash flows associated with stock option exercises 
financing cash flows for fiscal and are primarily related to the credit facilities we secured in connection with our acquisition of afc in november  and the subsequent repayment of these facilities and issuance of the senior notes in february see discussion under the heading long term debt and revolving credit facilities below 
liquidity and capital resources 
as of september   we had cash of  our primary source of working capital is cash flow from our operations and our revolving credit line which had availability of  as of september  availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
in addition  we may incur additional debt to fund capital projects  strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes  subject to our existing leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by our lenders 
the availability of our cash inflows is affected by the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for our products 
from time to time  we may explore options to refinance our borrowings 
the timing of our cash outflows is affected by payments and expenses related to the manufacture of our products  capital projects  pension funding  interest on our debt obligations and environmental remediation or other contingencies  which may place demands on our short term liquidity 
although we are not currently party to any material pending legal proceedings  we are from time to time subject to claims and lawsuits related to our business operations and we have incurred legal and other costs as a result of litigation and other contingencies 
we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods 
if such costs are material  to the extent not covered by insurance  they would adversely affect our liquidity 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and existing or future debt arrangements will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations on both a short term and long term basis

in august  we completed the exchange of of the senior notes for substantially identical notes which are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
revolving credit facility 
in february  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  national association  and certain other lenders  which provides a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to  with an initial maturity of years 
we may prepay and terminate the revolving credit facility at any time 
the annual interest rates applicable to loans under the revolving credit facility are  at our option  either the alternate base rate or libor rate each as defined in the revolving credit facility plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is tied to our total leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we pay commitment fees  other fees related to the issuance and maintenance of letters of credit  and certain agency fees 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets of our current and future domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains certain negative covenants restricting and limiting our ability to  among other things incur debt  incur contingent obligations and issue certain types of preferred stock  create liens  pay dividends  distributions or make other specified restricted payments  make certain investments and acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of assets 

table of contents financial covenants under the revolving credit facility include quarterly requirements for total leverage ratio of less than or equal to to  and interest coverage ratio of at least to 
as of september   our total leverage ratio was to and our interest coverage ratio was to 
the revolving credit facility also contains usual and customary events of default subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay the obligations under the revolving credit facility prior to its stated maturity and the related commitments may be terminated 
as of september   under our revolving credit facility  we had no borrowings outstanding  availability of  and we were in compliance with its various financial covenants 
availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
prior credit facilities 
in connection with our acquisition of the afc business  discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  on november   we entered into a  first lien credit agreement the first lien credit facility with wachovia bank  national association and other lenders 
we also entered into a  second lien credit agreement the second lien credit facility  and together with the first lien credit facility  the prior credit facilities with wachovia bank  national association  and certain other lenders 
the prior credit facilities were collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries 
concurrent with the issuance of our senior notes in february  we repaid our first lien term loan  amended our first lien credit facility and repaid and terminated our second lien credit facility 
the amendment to the first lien credit facility resulted in our revolving credit facility  described above 
seller subordinated note 
in connection with our acquisition of the afc business  discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  we issued an unsecured subordinated seller note the seller subordinated note in the principal amount of  to aerojet general corporation  a subsidiary of gencorp inc the seller subordinated note accrued payment in kind interest at a rate equal to the three month us dollar libor as from time to time in effect plus a margin equal to the weighted average of the interest rate margin for the loans outstanding under the prior credit facilities  including certain changes in interest rates due to subsequent amendments or refinancing of the prior credit facilities 
the seller subordinated note was subordinated to the senior debt under or related to the prior credit facilities and certain other indebtedness  subject to certain terms and conditions 
in connection with our february refinancing activities  we negotiated an early retirement of the seller subordinated note at a discount of approximately  from its face amount 
on february   we paid aerojet general corporation  representing full settlement of the seller subordinated note and accrued interest 
debt issue costs and debt repayment charges 
in connection with the repayment of our prior credit facilities  we recorded a charge for approximately  to write off the unamortized balance of debt issue costs associated with those facilities 
in addition  we paid a pre payment penalty of to terminate the second lien credit facility 
these charges are presented as debt repayment charges in our statement of operations 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately  which were capitalized and classified as other assets on the balance sheet 
these costs will be amortized as additional interest expense over the eight year term on the senior notes 
interest rate swap agreements 
in may  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  with original expirations on june   for the purpose of hedging a portion of our exposure to changes in variable rate interest on our prior credit facilities 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we paid fixed rate interest and received variable rate interest based on a specific spread over three month libor 
the differential to be paid or received was recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we recorded an asset or liability for the fair value of the swap agreements  with the effect of marking these contracts to fair 
table of contents value being recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the aggregate fair value of the swap agreements at september   which was recorded as other long term liabilities  was in connection with the refinancing of our prior credit facilities  we terminated our swap agreements at a cost of  which resulted in a gain of that is recorded as a reduction of interest expense in fiscal environmental remediation ampac henderson site 
during our fiscal third quarter  we recorded a charge for  representing our estimate of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at the ampac henderson site  including the costs for capital equipment  operating and maintenance o m  and consultants 
the project consists of two primary phases the initial construction of the remediation equipment phase and the operating and maintenance phase 
during fiscal  we increased our total cost estimate of probable costs for the construction phase by  due primarily to changes in the engineering designs  delays in receiving permits and the resulting extension of construction time 
in addition  certain remediation activities are conducted on public lands under operating permits 
in general  these permits require us to return the land to its original condition at the end of the permit period 
estimated costs associated with removal of remediation equipment from the land are not material and are included in our range of estimated costs 
as part of our efforts to remediate groundwater near the ampac henderson site  we chose to use in situ bioremediation isb  which is a new technology 
accordingly  as we gain isb operational experience  we have and are observing certain conditions  operating results and other data which we consider in updating the assumptions used to determine our costs estimates 
the two most significant assumptions are the estimated speed of groundwater flowing to our remediation extraction wells and the estimated annual o m costs 
groundwater speed is one key variable used to estimate the number of years that may be required to operate the facility 
groundwater speed is estimated by utilizing periodic data that measures  among other things  perchlorate concentrations upgradient from the treatment area in addition to hydraulic conductivity and porosity 
as time passes  and as we continue to add reference data and analysis  our estimates of the total years of operation may change 
initially  data suggested that the total project life would extend for a period of years 
more recent data indicates that the total project life may be years 
we are unable to predict over the longer term the most probable life and accordingly have used an assumed range of to years of operation 
o m costs include primarily labor  utilities  repairs  maintenance supplies and consulting costs 
since the inception of operations of the new isb technology operations in fiscal  we have not consistently achieved the targeted levels of groundwater remediation 
we have experienced annualized o m cost levels of approximately  which is higher than our initial estimates 
this higher level of cost reflects costs to evaluate methods to optimize operating performance and maintenance of reinjection wells 
in addition  we anticipate incurring similar o m cost levels in fiscal as we continue our evaluation of methods to achieve targeted remediation results 
our range of estimated costs  assumes that we will be successful in optimizing the remediation plant performance and that average annual o m costs for the duration of the project will be approximately as of september   the aggregate range of anticipated environmental remediation costs was from approximately  to approximately  and the accrued amount was  these estimates are based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our fiscal year contractual obligations and commitments as of september  
table of contents payments due by year ending september  thereafter total senior notes interest on senior notes at annually capital leases interest on capital leases operating leases total in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the table above  at september  we have recorded an estimated liability for environmental remediation of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we expect to spend approximately for environmental remediation during fiscal we have recorded aggregate defined benefit pension plan and supplemental executive retirement plan serp obligations of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we expect to contribute  to our defined benefit pension plans and serp during fiscal we have uncertain tax positions totaling we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the related payments  if any 
we also maintain the revolving credit facility  which provides revolving credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to  with an initial maturity in february at september   we had no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we may prepay and terminate the revolving credit facility at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit 
as of september   we had  in outstanding standby letters of credit which mature through march these letters of credit principally secure performance of certain water treatment equipment sold by us and payment of fees associated with the delivery of natural gas and power 
employee agreements 
we have an employment agreement with our chief operating officer  the term of which ends on september   unless amended or extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement or otherwise 
significant contract provisions include annual base salary  health care benefits  and non compete provisions 
the employment agreement is primarily an at will employment agreement  under which we may terminate the employment of our chief operating officer for any or no reason 
generally  the agreement provides that a termination without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
effective as of july   we entered into severance agreements with each of our vice president  administration and our chief financial officer  which  generally  provide that a termination of the executive without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
in addition  certain other key divisional executives are eligible for severance benefits 
estimated minimum aggregate severance benefits under all of these agreements and arrangements was  as of september  inflation general inflation did not have a material or significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that we adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgment  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
sales and revenue recognition 
revenues from our specialty chemicals segment  fine chemicals segment  and other businesses segment are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
almost all products sold by our fine chemicals segment are subject to customer acceptance periods and at times we receive payment for the product prior to customer acceptance 
if we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance  we record deferred revenues upon delivery of the product and recognize these revenues in the period when the acceptance period lapses or customer s acceptance has occurred 
some of our perchlorate and fine chemicals products customers have requested that we store materials purchased from us in our facilities bill and hold transactions 
we recognize revenue prior to shipment of these bill and hold transactions when we have satisfied the criteria of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in the financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which include the point at which title and risk of ownership transfer to our customers 
these customers have specifically requested in writing  pursuant to a contract  that we invoice for the finished product and hold the finished product until a later date 
revenues from our aerospace equipment segment are derived from contracts that are accounted for in conformity with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contracts and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we account for these contracts using the percentage of completion method and measure progress on a cost to cost basis 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses 
revenues are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for fixed price and fixed price incentive contracts  if at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract  the loss is recognized immediately 
depreciable or amortizable lives of long lived assets 
our depreciable or amortizable long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which are recorded at cost 
depreciation or amortization is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the asset s estimated economic useful life or the lease term  if the asset is subject to a capital lease 
economic useful life is the duration of time that we expect the asset to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
significant assumptions that affect the determination of estimated economic useful life include wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  and changes in market demand for products 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technological advances  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we test our property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such circumstances include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce and inflation 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews but cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
environmental costs 
we are subject to environmental regulations that relate to our past and current operations 
we record liabilities for environmental remediation costs when our assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review our estimates of future costs that could be incurred for remediation activities 
in some cases  only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated 
in establishing our reserves  the most probable estimate is used  otherwise  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
estimates of liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technologies and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances 
accrued environmental remediation costs include the undiscounted cost of equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and fees to outside law firms and consultants  for the estimated duration of the remediation activity 
estimating environmental cost requires us to exercise substantial judgment regarding the cost  effectiveness and duration of our remediation activities 
actual future expenditures could differ materially from our current estimates 
we evaluate potential claims for recoveries from other parties separately from our estimated liabilities 
we record an asset for expected recoveries when recoveries of the amounts are probable 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
taxes on income of the company s foreign subsidiary is provided at the tax rate applicable to the tax jurisdiction in which it is located 
on july   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company s adoption of this standard was consistent with fasb staff position fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
 that was issued in may that provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing unrecognized tax benefits 
under fin  the company may recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized is the largest benefit that the company believes has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 

table of contents actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
pension benefits 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in various forms for employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in actuarial models to calculate the pension expense and liability related to the various plans 
we determine the assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the future rate of compensation increases based on historical plan data 
the actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
depending on the assumptions selected  pension expense could vary significantly and could have a material effect on reported earnings 
the assumptions used can also materially affect the measurement of benefit obligations 
recently issued or adopted accounting standards 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb deferred the adoption of sfas no 
for one year as it applies to certain items  including assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination  reporting units and certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value in connection with goodwill impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
sfas no 
will be effective for us on october  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option established by sfas no 
permits all companies to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
at each subsequent reporting date  a company must report in earnings any unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected 
sfas no 
was effective for us on october  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
r applies to us prospectively for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after october  we expect that sfas no 
r  once adopted  will have an impact on accounting for business combinations  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the 
table of contents deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  sfas no 
requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas no 
clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas no 
also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning on october  we currently have no entities or arrangements that will be affected by the adoption of sfas no 
however  determination of the ultimate effect of this pronouncement will depend on our structure at the date of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we have limited exposure to market risk 
currently  we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
as of september   our outstanding debt is comprised primarily of  aggregate principal of the senior notes 
we estimate that the fair value of the senior notes to be approximately  based on the most recent trade data  which was as of november  to the extent we may be subject to interest rate risk  our exposure is primarily due to changes in market interest rates as compared to the fixed rate for the senior notes 
at september   we had no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and  therefore  to the extent we draw down on such facility in the future  it could be affected by changes in market interest rates 
although we do have a significant amount of export sales  to date these transactions have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we believe we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our export sales could be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
