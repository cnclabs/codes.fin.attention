the management s discussion and analysis which follows isolates  in order to be meaningful  the results of the acquisition of the travelers insurance company  excluding certain assets  most significantly  primerica  from 
table of contents citigroup inc citigroup  and substantially all of citigroup s international insurance businesses collectively  travelers in the period over period comparison as the travelers acquisition was not included in the results of the company until july  the travelers amounts which have been isolated represent the results of the travelers legal entities which have been acquired 
these amounts represent the impact of the travelers acquisition  however  as business currently transacted through the acquired travelers legal entities is transitioned to legal entities already owned by the company  some of which has already occurred  the identification of the travelers legal entity business will not necessarily be indicative of the impact of the travelers acquisition on the results of the company 
as a part of the travelers acquisition  management realigned certain products and services within several of the company s segments to better conform to the way it manages and assesses its business 
accordingly  all prior period segment results have been adjusted to reflect such product reclassifications 
also in connection with the travelers acquisition  management has utilized its economic capital model to evaluate the deployment of capital based upon the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in the company s existing and newly acquired businesses and has adjusted such allocations based upon this model 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income available to common shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income available to common shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of for the year ended december  net income available to common shareholders decreased by  million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the period 
the decrease in net income available to common shareholders was primarily due to a decrease in income from discontinued operations of  million  net of income tax 
this decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally driven by a gain of billion  net of income tax  on the sale of the peter cooper village and stuyvesant town properties in manhattan  new york  that was recognized during the year ended december  also contributing to the decrease was lower net investment income and net investment gains losses from discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold or held for sale during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in addition  there was lower income from discontinued operations related to the sale of metlife insurance limited metlife australia annuities and pension businesses to a third party in the third quarter of and lower income from discontinued operations related to the sale of ssrm holdings  inc ssrm resulting from a reduction in additional proceeds from the sale received during the year ended december  as compared to the year december  an increase in other expenses of million  net of income tax  decreased net income available to common shareholders 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher dac amortization resulting from business growth  lower net investment losses in the current year and the net impact of revisions to management s assumption used to determine estimated gross profits and margins in both years 
in addition  other expenses increased due to higher compensation  higher interest expense on debt and interest on tax contingencies  higher minority interest expense  the net impact of revisions to certain liabilities in both periods  asset write offs  higher general spending and expenses related to growth initiatives  partially offset by lower legal costs and integration costs incurred in the prior year 
an increase in interest credited to policyholder account balances associated with an increase in the average policyholder account balance decreased net income available to common shareholders by million  net of income tax 
partially offsetting the decrease in net income available to common shareholders was an increase in net investment income of  million  net of income tax  primarily due to an increase in the average asset base and an increase in yields 
growth in the average asset base was primarily within fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  real estate joint ventures  and other limited partnership interests 
higher yields was primarily due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities  other limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds  equity securities and improved securities lending results  partially offset by lower returns on real estate joint ventures  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  hedge funds and mortgage loans 
management anticipates that investment income and the related yields on other limited partnership interests may decline during due to increased volatility in the equity and credit markets during 
table of contents additionally  there was a decrease in net investment losses of million  net of income tax  primarily due to a reduction of losses on fixed maturity securities resulting principally from the portfolio repositioning in a rising interest rate environment  increased gains from asset based foreign currency transactions due to a decline in the us dollar year over year against several major currencies and increased gains on equity securities  partially offset by increased losses from the mark to market on derivatives and reduced gains on real estate and real estate joint ventures 
the net effect of increases in premiums  fees and other revenues of  million  net of income tax  across all of the company s operating segments and increases in policyholder benefit and claims and policyholder dividends of million  net of income tax  was attributable to overall business growth and increased net income available to common shareholders 
the remainder of the variance is due to the change in effective tax rates between periods

this increase was primarily due to a gain of billion  net of income tax  on the sale of the peter cooper village and stuyvesant town properties in manhattan  new york  as well as a gain of million  net of income tax  related to the sale of ssrm during the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by gains during the year ended december  including  million  net of income tax  on the sales of the one madison avenue and park avenue properties in manhattan  new york  as well as gains on the sales of ssrm and metlife indonesia of million and million  respectively  both net of income tax 
in addition  there was lower net investment income and net investment gains from discontinued operations related to other real estate properties sold or held for sale during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net investment losses increased by million  net of income tax  to a loss of million  net of income tax  for the year ended december  from a loss of million  net of income tax  for the comparable period 
excluding the impact of the acquisition of travelers  which contributed a loss of million  net of income tax  during the first six months of to the year over year increase  net investment losses increased by million 
the increase in net investment losses was due to a combination of losses from the mark to market on derivatives and foreign currency transaction losses during  largely driven by increases in us interest rates and the weakening of the dollar against the major currencies the company hedges  notably the euro and pound sterling 
dividends on the holding company s series a preferred shares and series b preferred shares preferred shares issued in connection with financing the acquisition of travelers increased by million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period  as the preferred stock was issued in june the remainder of the increase of million in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  compared to the period was primarily due to an increase in premiums  fees and other revenues attributable to continued business growth across all of the company s operating segments 
also contributing to the increase was higher net investment income primarily due to an overall increase in the asset base  an increase in fixed maturity security yields  improved results on real estate and real estate joint ventures  mortgage 
table of contents loans  and other limited partnership interests  as well as higher short term interest rates on cash equivalents and short term investments 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in net investment income from securities lending results  and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees 
favorable underwriting results for the year ended december  were partially offset by a decrease in net interest margins 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses primarily due to higher interest expense on debt  increased general spending  higher compensation and commission costs and higher expenses related to growth initiatives and information technology projects  partially offset by a reduction in travelers integration expenses  principally corporate incentives

financial and economic environment 
during  the global capital markets reassessed the credit risk inherent in sub prime mortgages 
this reassessment led to a fairly broad repricing of all credit risk assets and strained market liquidity 
global central banks intervened to stabilize market conditions and protect against downside risks to economic growth 
still  market and economic conditions continued to deteriorate 
the economic community s consensus outlook of global economic growth is lower for calendar year  with a sizable minority of economists forecasting a recessionary environment 
the global capital markets have adjusted towards this consensus outlook  with interest rates and equity prices falling and risk spreads widening 
slow growth and recessionary periods are often associated with declining asset prices  lower interest rates  credit rating agency downgrades and increasing default losses 
the global capital markets are also less liquid now than in more normal environments 
liquidity conditions impact the cost of purchasing and selling assets and  at times  the ability to purchase or sell assets 
these adjustments in the global capital markets have also resulted in higher realized and expected volatility 
as expectations for global economic growth are lowered  factors such as consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the amount and profitability of the business we conduct 
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment and lower consumer spending  the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected 
adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents demographics 
in the coming decade  a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will be the rising income protection  wealth accumulation and needs of the retiring baby boomers 
as a result of increasing longevity  retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to finance retirements that may span or more years 
helping the baby boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry 
life insurers are well positioned to address the baby boomers rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for income protection 
the company believes that  among life insurers  those with strong brands  high financial strength ratings and broad distribution  are best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection products to baby boomers 
moreover  the life insurance industry s products and the needs they are designed to address are complex 
the company believes that individuals approaching retirement age will need to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements and that  in the workplace  as employees take greater responsibility for their benefit options and retirement planning  they will need information about their possible individual needs 
one of the challenges for the life insurance industry will be the delivery of this information in a cost effective manner 
competitive pressures 
the life insurance industry remains highly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development  technology and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition 
sufficient scale  financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 
regulatory changes 
the life insurance industry is regulated at the state level  with some products and services also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and capital requirements of the industry 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products  including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products 
pension plans 
on august   president bush signed the pension protection act of ppa into law 
the ppa is considered to be the most sweeping pension legislation since the adoption of the employee retirement income security act of erisa on september  the provisions of the ppa may  over time  have a significant impact on demand for pension  retirement savings  and lifestyle protection products in both the institutional and retail markets 
the impact of the legislation may have a positive effect on the life insurance and financial services industries in the future 
impact of hurricanes on august   hurricane katrina made landfall in the states of louisiana  mississippi and alabama  causing catastrophic damage to these coastal regions 
metlife s cumulative gross losses from hurricane katrina were million  million and million at december   and  respectively  primarily arising from the company s homeowners business 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized net losses  net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables and including reinstatement premiums and other reinsurance related premium adjustments related to the catastrophe  of million  million and million  respectively 
on october   hurricane wilma made landfall across the state of florida 
metlife s cumulative gross losses from hurricane wilma were million  million and million at december   and  respectively  primarily arising from the company s homeowners and automobile businesses 
during the years ended december  and  the company s auto home segment recognized net losses  net of income 
table of contents tax and reinsurance recoverables  of million and million  respectively  related to hurricane wilma 
the company did not recognize any loss during the year ended december   related to hurricane wilma 
additional hurricane related losses may be recorded in future periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to reinsurers are processed 
reinsurance recoveries are dependent upon the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers  which may be affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with hurricanes katrina and wilma and otherwise 
in addition  lawsuits  including purported class actions  have been filed in louisiana and mississippi challenging denial of claims for damages caused to property during hurricane katrina 
metropolitan property and casualty insurance company is a named party in some of these lawsuits 
in addition  rulings in cases in which metropolitan property and casualty insurance company is not a party may affect interpretation of its policies 
metropolitan property and casualty insurance company intends to vigorously defend these matters 
however  any adverse rulings could result in an increase in the company s hurricane related claim exposure and losses 
based on information known by management  it does not believe that additional claim losses resulting from hurricane katrina will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values  ii investment impairments  iii the recognition of income on certain investments  iv the application of the consolidation rules to certain investments  v the fair value of and accounting for derivatives  vi the capitalization and amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba  vii the measurement of goodwill and related impairment  if any  viii the liability for future policyholder benefits  ix accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets  x accounting for reinsurance transactions  xi accounting for employee benefit plans  and xii the liability for litigation and regulatory matters 
the application of purchase accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical estimates 
in applying these policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity securities  mortgage and consumer loans  policy loans  real estate  real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships  short term investments  and other invested assets 
the company s investments are exposed to three primary sources of risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks  stemming from such investment risks  are those associated with the determination of fair values  the recognition of impairments  the recognition of income on certain investments  and the potential consolidation of previously unconsolidated subsidiaries 

table of contents the company s investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale  except for trading securities  and are reported at their estimated fair value 
the fair values for public fixed maturity securities and public equity securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services 
however  in cases where quoted market prices are not available  such as for private fixed maturities  fair values are estimated using present value or valuation techniques 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices is based on i valuation methodologies  ii securities the company deems to be comparable  and iii assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments  including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty 
factors considered in estimating fair value include coupon rate  maturity  estimated duration  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  credit rating  industry sector of the issuer  and quoted market prices of comparable securities 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
one of the significant estimates related to available for sale securities is the evaluation of investments for other than temporary impairments 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
additionally  management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
the cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary in the period in which the determination is made 
these impairments are included within net investment gains losses and the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities is reduced accordingly 
the company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value 
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 

table of contents the recognition of income on certain investments eg loan backed securities  including mortgage backed and asset backed securities  certain investment transactions  trading securities  etc 
is dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned 
additionally  when the company enters into certain structured investment transactions  real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships for which the company may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 it may be required to consolidate such investments 
the accounting rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the determination of the fair value of investments  the timing and amount of impairments  the recognition of income  or consolidation of investments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions including swaps  forwards  futures and option contracts 
the company uses derivatives primarily to manage various risks 
the risks being managed are variability in cash flows or changes in fair values related to financial instruments and currency exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign operations 
to a lesser extent  the company uses credit derivatives  such as credit default swaps  to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market 
the company also purchases certain securities  issues certain insurance policies and engages in certain reinsurance contracts that have embedded derivatives 
fair value of derivatives is determined by quoted market prices or through the use of pricing models 
the determination of fair value  when quoted market values are not available  is based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate under the circumstances 
derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  market volatility  and liquidity 
values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions used in pricing models 
such assumptions include estimates of volatility  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  other financial indices and credit ratings 
essential to the analysis of the fair value is risk of counterparty default 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated derivative fair value amounts  as well as the amount of reported net income 
also  fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives which have not been designated for hedge accounting may result in significant volatility in net income 
the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment under these accounting standards 
if it was determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
differences in judgment as to the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company from that previously reported 
measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income 
additionally  there is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation may not be identified and reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements and that their related changes in fair value could materially affect reported net income 
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
costs that vary with and relate to the production of new business are deferred as dac 
such costs consist principally of commissions and agency and policy issue expenses 
voba is an intangible asset that reflects the estimated fair 
table of contents value of in force contracts in a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the business in force at the acquisition date 
voba is based on actuarially determined projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
dac and voba are aggregated in the financial statements for reporting purposes 
dac for property and casualty insurance contracts  which is primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting expenses  is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term or reinsurance treaty 
dac and voba on life insurance or investment type contracts are amortized in proportion to gross premiums  gross margins or gross profits  depending on the type of contract as described below 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to non participating and non dividend paying traditional contracts term insurance  non participating whole life insurance  non medical health insurance  and traditional group life insurance over the entire premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and expected future gross premiums 
the present value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement of each policy and assumptions for mortality  morbidity  persistency  and investment returns at policy issuance  or policy acquisition  as it relates to voba  that include provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit liabilities 
these assumptions are not revised after policy issuance or acquisition unless the dac or voba balance is deemed to be unrecoverable from future expected profits 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium volumes 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to participating  dividend paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross margins 
the amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts 
the future gross margins are dependent principally on investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  mortality  persistency  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties  and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
for participating contracts dividend paying traditional contracts within the closed block future gross margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder dividend obligation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns  expenses  persistency  and other factor changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of dac and voba amortization 
each reporting period  the company updates the estimated gross margins with the actual gross margins for that period 
when the actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross margins  the cumulative dac and voba amortization is re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations 
when actual gross margins exceed those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below the previously estimated gross margins 
each reporting period  the company also updates the actual amount of business in force  which impacts expected future gross margins 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to fixed and variable universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits 
the amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts 
the amount of future gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders  mortality  persistency  interest crediting rates  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties  the effect of any hedges used  and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns  expenses  and persistency are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of dac and voba amortization 
each reporting period  the company updates the estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that period 
when the actual gross profits change from previously estimated gross profits  the cumulative dac and voba amortization is re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations 
when actual gross profits exceed those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are below the previously estimated gross profits 

table of contents each reporting period  the company also updates the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future gross profits 
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in force account balances on such contracts each reporting period 
returns that are higher than the company s long term expectation produce higher account balances  which increases the company s future fee expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death benefit guarantees  resulting in higher expected future gross profits 
the opposite result occurs when returns are lower than the company s long term expectation 
the company s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short term market fluctuations  but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected 
the company monitors these changes and only changes the assumption when its long term expectation changes 
the effect of an increase decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in the dac and voba balances of approximately million with an offset to the company s unearned revenue liability of approximately million for this factor 
the company also reviews periodically other long term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits 
these include investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses to administer business 
management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed 
if the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase  dac and voba amortization will decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease 
over the past two years  the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of dac and voba have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  in force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on contracts included within the individual segment 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
the following chart illustrates the effect on dac and voba within the company s individual segment of changing each of the respective assumptions during the years ended december  and years ended december  in millions investment return expense in force persistency policyholder dividends and other total as of december  and  dac and voba for the individual segment were billion and billion  respectively  and for the total company were billion and billion  respectively 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach  which requires the use of estimates and judgment  at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment  if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  goodwill within corporate other is allocated to reporting units 
table of contents within the company s business segments 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market multiple  a discounted cash flow model  or a cost approach 
the critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings  comparative market multiples and the discount rate 
liability for future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  traditional annuities and non medical health insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of expected future benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of expected future premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumptions  additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
liabilities for future policy benefits for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations  expenses and interest 
liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
other policyholder funds include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on life and non medical health insurance 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life policies are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
the assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac  and are thus subject to the same variability and risk 
the company offers certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefit riders 
these include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb riders and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab riders 
gmwb and gmab riders are embedded derivatives  which are measured at fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract  with changes in fair value reported in net investment gains losses 
the fair values of gmwb and gmab riders are calculated based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to the projected cash flows  including benefits and related contract charges  over the lives of the contracts  incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
these riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining markets  causing an increase in liabilities for future policy benefits  negatively affecting net income 
the company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies  guarantees and riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 

table of contents income taxes income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with its operations 
the company provides for federal  state and foreign income taxes currently payable  as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established  as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
the company may be required to change its provision for income taxes in certain circumstances 
examples of such circumstances include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances 
additionally  future events  such as changes in tax laws  tax regulations  or interpretations of such laws or regulations  could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate 
any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 
as described more fully in adoption of new accounting pronouncements  the company adopted fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin effective january  under fin  the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a provider and a purchaser of reinsurance for its life and property and casualty insurance products 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance contracts  the company determines if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company reviews all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the contract using the deposit method of accounting 

table of contents employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of the holding company the subsidiaries sponsor and or administer pension and other postretirement plans covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the obligations and expenses associated with these plans require an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  healthcare cost trend rates  as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements  withdrawal rates and mortality 
management  in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm  determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical performance of the plan and its assets  currently available market and industry data  and expected benefit payout streams 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to  among other factors  changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
litigation contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal actions and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims  the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the possible impact of tort reform efforts  the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known  and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis  the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
economic capital economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
as a part of the economic capital process  a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk based capital rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses

the following table provides the change from the prior year in income from continuing operations by segment of total change change in millions international institutional corporate other individual auto home reinsurance total change  net of income tax 
table of contents the increase in the international segment s income from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors an increase in argentina s income from continuing operations primarily due to a net reduction of liabilities resulting from pension reform  a reduction in claim liabilities resulting from experience reviews in both the current and prior years  higher premiums resulting from higher pension contributions attributable to higher participant salaries  higher net investment income resulting from capital contributions in the prior year  and a smaller increase in market indexed policyholder liabilities without a corresponding decrease in net investment income  partially offset by the reduction of cost of insurance fees as a result of the new pension system reform regulation  an increase in retention incentives related to pension reform  as well as lower trading portfolio income 
argentina also benefited  in both the current and prior years  from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against which valuation allowances had been previously established 
mexico s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities caused by a decrease in the unrealized investment results on invested assets supporting those liabilities relative to the prior year  the favorable impact of experience refunds during the first quarter of  a reduction in claim liabilities resulting from an experience review and the unfavorable impact in the prior year resulting from an adjustment to experience refunds in its institutional business  a year over year decrease in dac amortization resulting from management s update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits in both the current and prior years  a decrease in liabilities based on a review of outstanding remittances  and growth in its institutional and universal life businesses 
these increases in mexico s income from continuing operations were partially offset by lower fees resulting from management s update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits  the favorable impact in the prior year associated with a large group policy that was not renewed  a decrease in various one time revenue items  lower investment yields  the favorable impact in the prior year of liabilities related to employment matters that were reduced  and the benefit in the prior year from the elimination of liabilities for pending claims determined to be invalid 
taiwan s income from continuing operations increased primarily driven by an increase due to higher dac amortization in the prior year resulting from a loss recognition adjustment and restructuring costs  partially offset by the favorable impact of liability refinements in the prior year  as well as higher policyholder liabilities related to loss recognition in the fourth quarter of brazil s income from continuing operations increased due to the unfavorable impact of increases in policyholder liabilities due to higher than expected mortality on specific blocks of business and an increase in litigation liabilities in the prior year  the unfavorable impact of the reversal of a tax credit in the prior year  as well as growth of the in force business 
ireland s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses for which a valuation allowance had been previously established  higher investment income  partially offset by higher start up expenses and currency transaction losses 
japan s income from continuing operations increased due to improved hedge results and business growth  partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction losses 
hong kong s income from continuing operations increased due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in metlife fubon and the resulting consolidation of the operation  as well as business growth 
chile s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to growth of the in force business  higher joint venture income and higher returns on inflation indexed securities  partially offset by higher compensation  infrastructure and marketing expenses 
income from continuing operations increased in the united kingdom due to a reduction of claim liabilities resulting from an experience review  offset by an unearned premium calculation refinement 
australia s income from continuing operations increased due to growth of the in force business and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents these increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset by a decrease in the home office due to higher economic capital charges and investment expenses  an increase in contingent tax expenses in the current year  as well as higher spending due to growth and initiatives  partially offset by the elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously charged to the international segment  and a tax benefit associated with a prior year income tax expense related to a revision of an estimate 
india s income from continuing operations decreased primarily due to headcount increases and growth initiatives  as well as the impact of valuation allowances established against losses in both years 
south korea s income from continuing operations decreased due to a favorable impact in the prior year associated with the implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system  as well as additional expenses in the current year associated with growth and infrastructure initiatives  partially offset by continued growth and lower dac amortization  both in the variable universal life business 
the institutional segment s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to lower net investment losses  an increase in interest margins  an increase in underwriting results  the impact of revisions to certain expenses in both periods  partially offset by higher expenses due to an increase in non deferrable volume related and corporate support expenses and an increase in dac amortization resulting from the ongoing implementation of statement of position sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop in the current year 
corporate other s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to higher net investment income  lower net investment losses  lower corporate expenses  higher other revenues  integration costs incurred in the prior year  and lower legal costs  partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits  higher interest expense on debt  higher interest on tax contingencies  and higher interest credited to bankholder deposits 
the individual segment s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to a decrease in net investment losses  higher fee income from separate account products  higher net investment income on blocks of business not driven by interest margins and an increase in interest margins  partially offset by higher dac amortization  unfavorable underwriting results in life products  higher general expenses  the impact of revisions to certain liabilities in both years  the write off of a receivable in the current year  an increase in the closed block related policyholder dividend obligation  higher annuity benefits  an increase in policyholder dividends and an increase in interest credited to policyholder account balances 
the auto home segment s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to an increase in premiums and other revenues  an increase in net investment income  an increase in net investment gains and a decrease in other expenses 
these were partially offset by losses related to higher claim frequencies  higher earned exposures  higher losses due to severity  an increase in unallocated claims adjusting expenses and an increase from a reduction in favorable development of prior year losses  partially offset by a decrease in catastrophe losses  which included favorable development of prior year catastrophe reserves  all of which are related to policyholder benefits and claims 
also offsetting the increase in income from continuing operations was a decrease in average earned premium per policy and an increase in catastrophe reinsurance costs 
the reinsurance segment s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to an increase in premiums due to additional business in force from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business  an increase in net investment income due to growth in the asset base  an increase in other revenues and a decrease in other expenses  partially offset by an increase in net investment losses which was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with the reinsurance of annuity products on a funds withheld basis 
revenues and expenses premiums  fees and other revenues premiums  fees and other revenues increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 

table of contents the following table provides the change from the prior year in premiums  fees and other revenues by segment of total change change in millions institutional reinsurance international individual auto home corporate other total change the growth in the institutional segment was primarily due to increases in the non medical health other and group life businesses 
the non medical health other business increased primarily due to growth in the dental  disability  accidental death dismemberment ad d and individual disability insurance idi businesses 
partially offsetting these increases is a decrease in the long term care ltc business  net of a decrease resulting from a shift to deposit liability type contracts in the current year  partially offset by growth in the business 
the group life business increased primarily due to business growth in term life and increases in corporate owned life insurance and life insurance sold to postretirement benefit plans 
these increases in the non medical health other and group life businesses were partially offset by a decrease in the retirement savings business 
the decrease in retirement savings was primarily due to a decrease in structured settlement and pension closeout premiums  partially offset by an increase in other products 
the growth in the reinsurance segment was primarily attributable to premiums from new facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business in all rga s operating segments 
in addition  other revenues increased due to an increase in surrender charges on asset intensive business reinsured and an increase in fees associated with financial reinsurance 
the growth in the international segment was primarily due to the following factors an increase in mexico s premiums  fees and other revenues due to higher fees and growth in its institutional and universal life businesses  a decrease in experience refunds during the first quarter of on mexico s institutional business  as well as the adverse impact in the prior year of an adjustment for experience refunds on mexico s institutional business  offset by lower fees resulting from management s update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and various one time revenue items which benefited both the current and prior years 
premiums  fees and other revenues increased in hong kong primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in metlife fubon and the resulting consolidation of the operation as well as business growth 
chile s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to higher annuity sales  higher institutional premiums from its traditional and bank distribution channels  and the decrease in the prior year resulting from management s decision not to match aggressive pricing in the marketplace 
south korea s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to higher fees from growth in its guaranteed annuity and variable universal life businesses 
brazil s premiums  fees and other revenues increased due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and business growth 
premiums  fees and other revenues increased in japan due to an increase in reinsurance assumed 
australia s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in the institutional and reinsurance business in force  an increase in retention levels and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents argentina s premiums  fees and other revenues increased due to higher pension contributions resulting from higher participant salaries and a higher salary threshold subject to fees and growth in bancassurance  offset by the reduction of cost of insurance fees as a result of the new pension system reform regulation 
taiwan s and india s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to business growth 
these increases in premiums  fees and other revenues were partially offset by a decrease in the united kingdom due to an unearned premium calculation refinement  partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the growth in the individual segment was primarily due to higher fee income from variable life and annuity and investment type products and growth in premiums from other life products  partially offset by a decrease in immediate annuity premiums and a decline in premiums associated with the company s closed block business  in line with expectations 
the growth in the auto home segment was primarily due to an increase in premiums related to increased exposures  an increase in various voluntary and involuntary programs  and a change in estimate on auto rate refunds due to a regulatory examination  as well as an increase in other revenues primarily due to slower than anticipated claim payments in these increases were partially offset by a reduction in average earned premium per policy  and an increase in catastrophe reinsurance costs 
the increase in corporate other was primarily related to the resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the acquisition of general american life insurance company galic  partially offset by an adjustment of surrender values on corporate owned life insurance policies 
net investment income net investment income increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
management attributes  million of this increase to growth in the average asset base and million to an increase in yields 
the increase in net investment income from growth in the average asset base was primarily within fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests 
the increase in net investment income attributable to higher yields was primarily due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities  other limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds  equity securities and improved securities lending results  partially offset by lower returns on real estate joint ventures  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  hedge funds and mortgage loans 
management anticipates that investment income and the related yields on other limited partnership interests may decline during due to increased volatility in the equity and credit markets during interest margin interest margin  which represents the difference between interest earned and interest credited to policyholder account balances increased in the institutional and individual segments for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
interest earned approximates net investment income on investable assets attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related to the consolidation of certain separate accounts and other minor non policyholder elements 
interest credited is the amount attributed to insurance products  recorded in policyholder benefits and claims  and the amount credited to policyholder account balances for investment type products  recorded in interest credited to policyholder account balances 
interest credited on insurance products reflects the current year impact of the interest rate assumptions established at issuance or acquisition 
interest credited to policyholder account balances is subject to contractual terms  including some minimum guarantees 
this tends to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate movements and may reflect actions by management to respond to competitive pressures and  therefore  generally does not introduce volatility in expense 
net investment gains losses net investment losses decreased by million to a loss of million for the year ended december  from a loss of  million for the comparable period 
the decrease in net investment losses was 
table of contents primarily due to a reduction of losses on fixed maturity securities resulting principally from the portfolio repositioning in a rising interest rate environment  increased gains from asset based foreign currency transactions due to a decline in the us dollar year over year against several major currencies and increased gains on equity securities  partially offset by increased losses from the mark to market on derivatives and reduced gains on real estate and real estate joint ventures 
underwriting underwriting results are generally the difference between the portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality  morbidity or other insurance costs  less claims incurred  and the change in insurance related liabilities 
underwriting results are significantly influenced by mortality  morbidity or other insurance related experience trends  as well as the reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business 
consequently  results can fluctuate from period to period 
underwriting results  excluding catastrophes  in the auto home segment were less favorable for the year ended december   as the combined ratio  excluding catastrophes  increased to from for the year ended december  underwriting results were favorable in the non medical health other  group life and retirement savings businesses in the institutional segment 
underwriting results were unfavorable in the life products in the individual segment 
other expenses other expenses increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
the following table provides the change from the prior year in other expenses by segment of total change change in millions individual international institutional corporate other auto home reinsurance total change the individual segment contributed to the year over year increase in other expenses primarily due to higher dac amortization  higher expenses associated with business growth  information technology and other general expenses  the impact of revisions to certain liabilities  including pension and postretirement liabilities and policyholder liabilities in the prior year  and a write off of a receivable in the current year 
the international segment contributed to the year over year increase in other expenses primarily due to the business growth commensurate with the increase in revenues discussed above 
it was driven by the following factors argentina s other expenses increased primarily due to a liability for servicing obligations that was established as a result of pension reform  an increase in commissions on bancassurance business  an increase in retention incentives related to pension reform  and the impact of management s update of dac assumptions as a result of pension reform and growth  partially offset by a lower increase in liabilities due to inflation and exchange rate indexing 
south korea s other expenses increased primarily due to the favorable impact in dac amortization associated with the implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system in the prior year  additional expenses associated with growth and infrastructure initiatives  as well as business growth and higher bank insurance fees  partially offset by a decrease in dac amortization 

table of contents mexico s other expenses increased due to higher expenses related to business growth and the favorable impact in the prior year of liabilities that were reduced  offset by a decrease in dac amortization resulting from management s update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits in both the current and prior years and a decrease in liabilities based on a review of outstanding remittances 
other expenses increased in india primarily due to headcount increases and growth initiatives  partially offset by the impact of management s update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits

ireland s other expenses increased due to higher start up costs  as well as foreign currency transaction losses 
brazil s other expenses increased due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by an increase in litigation liabilities in the prior year 
the united kingdom s other expenses increased due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher spending on business initiatives partially offset by lower dac amortization resulting from calculation refinements 
these increases in other expenses were partially offset by a decrease in taiwan s other expenses primarily due to a one time increase in dac amortization in the prior year due to a loss recognition adjustment resulting from low interest rates related to product guarantees coupled with high persistency rates on certain blocks of business  an increase in dac amortization in the prior year associated with the implementation of a new valuation system  as well as one time expenses in the prior year related to the termination of the agency force  and expense reductions recognized in the current year due to the elimination of the agency force 
other expenses decreased in the home office primarily due to the elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously charged to the international segment  offset by higher spending on growth and infrastructure initiatives 
the institutional segment contributed to the year over year increase primarily due to an increase in non deferrable volume related and corporate support expenses  higher dac amortization associated with the ongoing implementation of sop in the current year  a charge related to the reimbursement of dental claims in the current year  the establishment of a contingent legal liability in the current year and the impact of certain revisions in both years 
these increases were partially offset by a benefit related to a reduction of an allowance for doubtful accounts in the current year  the impact of a charge of non deferrable ltc commissions expense  a charge associated with costs related to the sale of certain small market record keeping businesses and a regulatory settlement  all in the prior year 
corporate other contributed to the year over year increase in other expenses primarily due to higher interest expense  higher interest on tax contingences and an increase in interest credited to bankholder deposits at metlife bank  national association  a national bank metlife bank or metlife bank  na  partially offset by lower corporate support expenses  lower costs from reductions of metlife foundation contributions  integration costs incurred in the prior year and lower legal costs 
these increases in other expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the auto home segment primarily related to lower information technology and advertising costs  partially offset by minor changes in a variety of expense categories 
these increases in other expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the reinsurance segment primarily due to a decrease in expenses associated with dac  partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with note offerings in both years  an increase in minority interest expense  as well as an increase in compensation and overhead related expenses associated with rga s international expansion and general growth in the operations 

table of contents net income income tax expense for the year ended december  was  million  or of income from continuing operations before provision for income tax  compared with  million  or of such income  for the comparable period 
the and effective tax rates differ from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing 
in addition  the increase in the effective rate for fin liability additions is entirely offset by an increase in non taxable investment income 
the period includes a benefit for decrease in international deferred tax valuation allowances and the period included a prior year benefit for international taxes 
lastly  the period included benefit for a provision to filed return adjustment regarding non taxable investment income 
income from discontinued operations  net of income tax  decreased by  million  or  to million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
the decrease in income from discontinued operations was primarily due a gain of billion  net of income tax  on the sale of the peter cooper village and stuyvesant town properties in manhattan  new york  that was recognized during the year ended december  in addition  there was lower net investment income and net investment gains losses of million  net of income tax  from discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold or held for sale during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  also contributing to the decrease was lower income from discontinued operations of million  net of income tax  related to the sale of metlife australia s annuities and pension businesses to a third party in the third quarter of and lower income from discontinued operations of million  net of income tax  related to the sale of ssrm resulting from a reduction in additional proceeds from the sale received during the year ended december  as compared to the year december  year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was  million for the years ended december  and december  excluding the acquisition of travelers  which contributed million during the first six months of to the year over year increase  income from continuing operations decreased by million

liquidity and capital resources the company capital rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the national association of insurance commissioners naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit further regulatory action 
rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and statutory reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis 
the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
these rules apply to each of the holding company s domestic insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain rbc levels 
as of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators  the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those rbc levels

the goals of the investment process are to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the asset liability management process is the shared responsibility of the portfolio management unit  the financial management and oversight asset liability 
table of contents management unit  and the operating business segments under the supervision of the various product line specific asset liability management committees alm committees 
the alm committees duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios on a periodic basis  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the asset liability management process 
the portfolio managers and asset sector specialists  who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities  implement the goals and objectives established by the alm committees 
the company establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 
in executing these asset liability matching strategies  management regularly reevaluates the estimates used in determining the approximate amounts and timing of payments to or on behalf of policyholders for insurance liabilities 
many of these estimates are inherently subjective and could impact the company s ability to achieve its asset liability management goals and objectives 
liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs 
the company s liquidity position cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding securities lending was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
liquidity needs are determined from a rolling month forecast by portfolio and are monitored daily 
asset mix and maturities are adjusted based on forecast 
cash flow testing and stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its cash needs under various scenarios that include the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal 
the company includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products  including general account institutional pension products generally group annuities  including gics  and certain deposit fund liabilities sold to employee benefit plan sponsors 
certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product 
in the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond normal liquidity  the company has multiple alternatives available based on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need 
these options include cash flows from operations  the sale of liquid assets  global funding sources and various credit facilities 
the company s ability to sell investment assets could be limited by accounting rules including rules relating to the intent and ability to hold impaired securities until the market value of those securities recovers 
in extreme circumstances  all general account assets within a statutory legal entity are available to fund any obligation of the general account within that legal entity

under sfas  the projected pension benefit obligation pbo is defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested and non vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary levels 
the accumulated pension benefit obligation abo is the actuarial present value of vested and non vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary levels 
the pbo and abo of the pension plans are set forth in the following section

unlike the pbo for pensions  the epbo is not recorded in the financial statements but is used in measuring the periodic expense 
the accumulated postretirement plan benefit obligation apbo represents the actuarial present value of future postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered through a particular date

r sfas  effective december  upon adoption  the company was required to recognize in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation  which is the pbo for pension plans and the apbo for other postretirement plans 
the change to recognize funded status eliminated the additional minimum pension liability provisions of sfas in addition  the company recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income tax  those amounts of actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs and credits  and the remaining net transition asset or obligation that had not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost at the date of adoption 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a reduction of million  net of income tax  to accumulated other comprehensive income  which is included as a component of total consolidated stockholders equity

some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit payments  the expected rate of compensation increases and average expected retirement age 
assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations were as follows december  weighted average discount rate rate of compensation increase average expected retirement age the discount rate is determined annually based on the yield  measured on a yield to worst basis  of a hypothetical portfolio constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the valuation date  which would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate pbo when due 
the yield of this hypothetical portfolio  constructed of bonds rated aa or better by moody s investors services moody s resulted in a discount rate of approximately and for the defined pension plans as of december  and  respectively 
a decrease increase in the discount rate increases decreases the pbo 
this increase decrease to the pbo is amortized into earnings as an actuarial loss gain 
based on the december  pbo  a basis point decrease increase in the discount rate would result in an increase decrease in the pbo of million 
at the end of  total net actuarial losses were million as compared to  million in in  the majority of the reduction in the actuarial losses is due to the increase in the discount rate to in from in these losses will be amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plans 
at the end of  the average remaining service period of active employees was years for the pension plans 
as the benefits provided under the defined pension plans are calculated as a percentage of future earnings  an assumption of future compensation increases is required to determine the projected benefit obligation 
these rates are derived through periodic analysis of historical demographic data conducted by an independent actuarial firm 
the last review of such data was conducted using salary information through and the company believes that no circumstances have subsequently occurred that would result in a material change to the compensation rate assumptions 
other postretirement benefit plan obligations the apbo is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions  from which actual results may vary 
some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate  the healthcare cost trend rate and the average expected retirement age 
the determination of the discount rate and the average expected retirement age are substantially consistent with the determination described previously for the pension plans 

table of contents the assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the apbo and net periodic benefit cost were as follows december  pre medicare eligible claims down to in down to in medicare eligible claims down to in down to in assumed healthcare cost trend rates may have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percent one percent increase decrease in millions effect on total of service and interest cost components effect of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation a decrease increase in the discount rate increases decreases the apbo 
this increase decrease to the apbo is amortized into earnings as an actuarial loss gain 
based on the december  apbo  a basis point decrease increase in the discount rate would result in an increase decrease in the apbo of million 
at the end of  total net actuarial gains were million as compared to net actuarial losses of million in the majority of the net actuarial gains are due to the increase in the discount rate  an increased number of retirees opting out of plan benefits and lower than expected medical inflation 
these gains will be amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the other postretirement benefit plans 
at the end of  the average remaining service period of active employees was years for the other postretirement benefit plans 
in  the company adopted the guidance in fsp accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp  to account for future subsidies to be received under the prescription drug act 
the company began receiving these subsidies during a summary of the reduction to the apbo and related reduction to the components of net periodic other postretirement benefit cost is as follows december  in millions cumulative reduction in benefit obligation beginning of year service cost interest cost net actuarial gains losses prescription drug subsidy end of year years ended december  in millions reduction in net periodic benefit cost service cost interest cost amortization of net actuarial gains losses total reduction in net periodic benefit cost the company received subsidies of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

iii expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated pension fund assets in a particular year 
iv amortization of prior service cost this cost relates to the increase or decrease to pension benefit cost for service provided in prior years due to amendments in plans or initiation of new plans 
as the economic benefits of these costs are realized in the future periods  these costs are amortized to pension expense over the expected service years of the employees

all securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the company s process for identifying other than temporary impairments 
the company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors  as described in summary of critical accounting estimates investments  about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 

table of contents inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
while all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment  the company s experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment and  often  fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve 
the company records impairments as investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities accordingly

in following these portfolio management objectives  changes in facts and circumstances that were present in past 
table of contents reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell securities that were held in prior reporting periods 
decisions to sell are based on current conditions or the company s need to shift the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management objectives including liquidity needs or duration targets on asset liability managed portfolios 
the company attempts to anticipate these types of changes and if a sale decision has been made on an impaired security and that security is not expected to recover prior to the expected time of sale  the security will be deemed other than temporarily impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an other than temporary impairment loss will be recognized 
based upon the company s current evaluation of the securities in accordance with its impairment policy  the cause of the decline being principally attributable to the general rise in interest rates during the holding period  and the company s current intent and ability to hold the fixed maturity and equity securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient for them to recover  the company has concluded that the aforementioned securities are not other than temporarily impaired

these strategies are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 
to manage interest rate risk  the company performs periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of its investments and liabilities to interest rate movements 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
department regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of asset liability management and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the operating segments may reflect differences in legal 
table of contents entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 
common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each asset portfolio has a duration constraint based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments or curve mismatch strategies 
hedging activities 
to reduce interest rate risk  metlife s risk management strategies incorporate the use of various interest rate derivatives to adjust the overall duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its liabilities 
such instruments include financial futures  financial forwards  interest rate and credit default swaps  caps  floors and options 
metlife also uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments 
risk measurement sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments  including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts  based on changes in interest rates  equity market prices and currency exchange rates  utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing this analysis  the company used market rates at december  to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis separately calculated each of metlife s market risk exposures interest rate  equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate related to its trading and non trading invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets as follows the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the market value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity prices  and the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in currency exchange rates 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot assure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  for derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year 

table of contents accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate risk and asset liability management personnel 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets 
the equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the company to material market risk 
the table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments at december  in addition  the potential loss with respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the company s equity price sensitive positions at december  is set forth in the table below 
the potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure of the company s portfolio at december  was december  in millions non trading interest rate risk equity price risk foreign currency exchange rate risk trading interest rate risk 
table of contents the table below provides additional detail regarding the potential loss in fair value of the company s non trading interest sensitive financial instruments at december  by type of asset or liability december  assuming a increase notional estimated in the yield amount fair value curve in millions assets fixed maturity securities equity securities mortgage and consumer loans policy loans short term investments cash and cash equivalents mortgage loan commitments commitments to fund bank credit facilities  bridge loans and private corporate bond investments total assets liabilities policyholder account balances short term debt long term debt collateral financing arrangements junior subordinated debt securities shares subject to mandatory redemption payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions total liabilities other derivative instruments designated hedges or otherwise interest rate swaps interest rate floors interest rate caps financial futures foreign currency swaps foreign currency forwards options financial forwards credit default swaps synthetic gics other total other net change this quantitative measure of risk has decreased by million  or  to  million at december  from  million at december  a decrease in the yield curve has decreased our sensitivity by billion 
this decrease was partially offset by million due to increased asset size  million due to increased derivative usage and million due to duration charges and other 
in addition to the analysis above  as part of its asset liability management program  the company also performs an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates  including both insurance liabilities and financial instruments 
as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates applied to the company s liabilities  insurance and associated asset portfolios would reduce the fair value of equity by million 
management does not expect that this sensitivity would produce a liquidity strain on the company
