the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position  with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and long term basis 
the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows years ended december  cash flows from continuing operations in thousands net cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities during increased million over the prior year primarily reflecting higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization partially offset by higher incentive compensation  interest and tax payments

the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of million at year end this resulted primarily from an increase in deferred tax assets arising from accrued expenses  principally for state income taxes  and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets

on december   the company s long term debt instruments had a book value of  million and a fair value of approximately  million 
the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk based interest rates for the foreseeable future 
acquisition spending and or share repurchases could potentially increase company debt 
however  management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels 
operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company s various cash flow requirements  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
management is not aware of any potential impairment to the company s liquidity  and the company is in compliance with all of its long term debt covenants

in addition  the core components business showed strength in the frequency control and micro acoustics markets 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the company  including information regarding contingencies  risk and its financial condition 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where the financial information of dover is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectability is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred 
in revenue transactions where installation is required  revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers 
if the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete 
in addition  when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement  the company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified 
in a limited number of revenue transactions  other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and  accordingly  revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay  or acceptance has been confirmed 
service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
due to the fact that dover operates in many different markets  changes in economic conditions in specific markets generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances required 

table of contents inventory for the majority of the company s subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
the electronic technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
occasionally  the company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 
dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines including sfas no 
for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
dover s assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist 
the company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations 
the valuation of dover s pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in dover s pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for dover s future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on dover s pension expenses and related funding requirements 
dover s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns  economic trends and portfolio allocation 
dover s discount rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities  as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated  using a more likely than not criteria  for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations  changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates  and the company s future taxable income levels 
dover has significant accruals and reserves related to the self insured portion of its risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  dover s experience  and relevant industry data 
dover reviews these factors quarterly and considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and company experience 
dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dover s ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional 
table of contents reserves for emerging issues 
while dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to adjust  if necessary  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair market value less costs to sell 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates 
the company uses the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock appreciation rights sars and stock options that are granted to employees 
the model requires management to estimate the expected life of the sar or option  expected forfeitures and the volatility of dover s stock using historical data

non gaap disclosures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses non gaap information which management believes provides useful information to investors 
free cash flow  net debt  total debt  total capitalization  adjusted working capital  average annual adjusted working capital  revenues excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities  debt or equity  revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with gaap  and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
management believes the net debt to total capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity 
net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the company s capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs 
free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions  pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase the company s common stock 
reconciliations of free cash flow  total debt and net debt can be found above in this item  management s discussion and analysis 
management believes that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called working capital  which is calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable  provides a meaningful measure of the company s operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue 
management believes that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency  which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  provides a meaningful measure of the company s operational changes  given the global nature of dover s businesses 
management believes that reporting organic revenue growth  which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions  provides a useful comparison of the company s revenue performance and trends between periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt  interest rate swaps attached thereto  commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates of the company s weighted average long term debt interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt 
commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates  and have maturities of three months or less 
a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates of the company s weighted average commercial paper interest rate on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings
