capital resources and liquidity balance sheet and cash flows cash and equivalents at december   our cash balance decreased to million from million at december  the million decrease was primarily due to funding of our ongoing working capital needs and a reduction of borrowings under our abl facility

the calculations include crisa proforma net sales for working capital  defined as inventories and accounts receivable less accounts payable  increased by million in  compared to as a percentage of net sales  working capital remained constant at percent in  compared to the increase in working capital is primarily the result of the working capital investment at our new production facility in china and higher inventories in the united states and portugal

see contractual obligations below for scheduled payments by period 
we had total net borrowings of million at december   compared to total net borrowings of million at december  the million increase in borrowings was the result of additional pik notes issued on june and december and new credit facilities at crisal and libbey glassware china to fund working capital requirements  offset by a reduction in borrowings under our abl facility

see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and a further discussion as to the reasons we believe this non gaap financial measure is useful 
discussion of vs 
cash flow our net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in  or a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily related to an increase in earnings more than offset by higher uses of cash for inventory and pension contributions 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in  or a decrease of million 
the primary contributors to this reduction were the purchase of crisa in for million  a million decrease in capital expenditures driven by a reduction in spending resulting from the completion of the construction of our new facility in china in  and proceeds from asset sales and other items of million in  primarily attributable to the sale of excess land in syracuse  ny and the netherlands 
net cash used by financing activities was million in  compared to million net cash provided by financing activities in the net cash used by financing activities in is primarily attributable to the repayment of borrowings under our abl facility  partially offset by new working capital facilities in europe and china 
the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the additional debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of crisa and the construction of our production facility in china 
free cash flow was million in  compared to million in  an improvement of million 
the primary contributors to this improvement are the result of the changes in net cash used in investing activities discussed above 
these were partially offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating activities as discussed above 
discussion of vs 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily related to an increase in earnings  excluding special charges  and a reduction in working capital 
other factors impacting cash flow were an increase in non cash pension and nonpension postretirement expense and a decrease in non cash workers compensation expense 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in  or an increase of million 
the primary contributors to this change were the purchase of crisa in for million and a million increase in capital expenditures driven by the expenditures related to the construction of our new facility in china 
in  we incurred acquisition and related costs for our purchase of crisal of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in  or an increase of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the additional debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of crisa and the construction of our production facility in china 
the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from additional debt incurred in connection with the purchase of crisal 
free cash flow was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decline is mainly attributable to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities  which was more than offset by an increase in capital expenditures including million for the construction of our new facility in china and the crisa acquisition of million 
derivatives we have interest rate protection agreements rate agreements with respect to million of debt as a means to manage our exposure to variable interest rates 
the rate agreements effectively convert this portion of our long term borrowings from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future results 
the fixed interest rate for our borrowings related to the rate agreements at december   excluding applicable fees  is percent per year and the total interest rate  including applicable fees  is percent per year 
the average maturity of these rate agreements is years at december  total remaining debt not covered by the rate agreements has fluctuating interest rates with a weighted average rate of percent per year at december  the fair market value for the rate agreements at december  and  respectively  was million and million 
we also use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future natural gas requirements 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse price movements in the underlying commodity 
we consider our forecasted natural gas requirements in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast eligible to be hedged  typically ranging from percent to percent of our anticipated requirements  generally six or more months in the future 
at december   we had commodity futures contracts for  million british thermal units btu s of natural gas with a fair market value of million 
we have hedged a portion of our forecasted transactions through february at december   we had commodity futures contracts for  million btu s of natural gas with a fair market value of million 
during  we entered into a foreign currency contract for million pesos for a contractual payment due to vitro in january  related to the crisa acquisition 
the fair market value of the foreign currency contract at december  was million 
share repurchase program since mid  we have repurchased  shares for million  as authorized by our board of directors 
as of december   authorization remains for the purchase of an additional  shares 
during and  we did not repurchase any common stock 
our abl facility and the indentures governing the senior secured notes and the pik notes significantly restrict our ability to repurchase additional shares 
we are using a portion of the repurchased common stock to fund our employee stock benefit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents our existing contractual obligations at december  and related future cash requirements payments due by period dollars in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years borrowings interest payments long term operating leases payable to vitro pension and nonpension total obligations it is difficult to estimate future cash contributions as such amounts are a function of actual investment returns  withdrawals from the plan  changes in interest rates  and other factors uncertain at this time 
however  we have included our best estimate for contributions through the obligations for interest payments are based on december  debt levels and interest rates 
in addition to the above  we have commercial commitments secured by letters of credit and guarantees 
our letters of credit outstanding at december   totaled million 
the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above

through june   we recorded our percent interest in crisa using the equity method of accounting 
from this joint venture  we recorded equity earnings loss  dividends and certain technical assistance income 
we also had a reciprocal distribution agreement with our joint venture partner that gave us exclusive distribution rights with respect to crisa s glass tableware products in the us and canada  and gave crisa the exclusive distribution rights with respect to our glass tableware products in latin america 
in addition  we guaranteed a portion of crisa s bank debt 
while we owned percent of crisa  we evaluated this investment and related arrangements in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  and determined that crisa was a variable interest entity vie  as defined by fin r  however  we were not considered the primary beneficiary  as we did not absorb the majority of expected losses or received the majority of expected residual returns 
therefore  crisa was not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements through june  since we acquired the remaining percent of crisa on june   we have consolidated crisa s financial statements 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure regarding financial information relating to crisa 
capital resources and liquidity based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  our cash and cash equivalents and available capacity under our abl facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months

management regularly reviews the adequacy of the accruals based on current customer purchases  targeted purchases and payout levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through charges to the provision for bad debts 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical trends in collections and write offs  our judgment as to the probability of collecting accounts and our evaluation of business risk 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
accounts are determined to be uncollectible when the debt is deemed to be worthless or only recoverable in part and are written off at that time through a charge against the allowance 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimate appropriate allowance provisions accordingly 
we provide inventory allowances based upon excess and obsolete inventories driven primarily by future demand forecasts 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant  as a significant percentage of our inventories is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
at december   our inventories were million  with loss provisions of million  compared to inventories of million and loss provisions of million at december  asset impairment fixed assets we review fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions 
in  we wrote down certain assets to fair value at our syracuse china facility based upon appraisals performed by an independent third party 
this write down is further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill impairment tests are completed for each reporting unit on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method  which incorporates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer to compute the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
however  to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value  we compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its book value to determine if an impairment should be recorded 
this was done as of october st for each year presented 
our review indicated an impairment of goodwill of million at our syracuse china facility during this impairment is further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
individual indefinite life intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method to compute the fair value  which is then compared to the carrying value of the indefinite life intangible asset 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october for each year presented 
an impairment loss for intangible assets of million was recorded in for our syracuse china facility 
this impairment is further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents if the company s projected future cash flows were lower  or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were higher  the testing performed as of october   may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the company s other reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would also have been impaired 
self insurance reserves we use self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities related to workers compensation and employee health care benefits that are not covered by third party insurance 
workers compensation accruals are recorded at the estimated ultimate payout amounts based on individual case estimates 
in addition  we record estimates of incurred but not reported losses based on actuarial models 
group health accruals include estimates of incurred but not reported estimates received from our third party administrator of the plan 
although we believe that the estimated liabilities for self insurance are adequate  the estimates described above may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate self insurance liabilities are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we will continue to adjust our estimated liabilities for self insurance  as deemed necessary  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
pension assumptions the following are the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our pension plan benefits for  and us plans us plans discount rate to to to to expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase to to to to to to two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions on our annual measurement date of december other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at our december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change our total pension expense by approximately million 
a change of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million based on year end data 

table of contents nonpension postretirement assumptions we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs  to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree welfare plan 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected retiree medical benefits at our december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the following are the actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our nonpension postretirement benefits us plans us plans discount rate initial health care trend ultimate health care trend years to reach ultimate trend rate sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change the nonpension postretirement expense by million 
a change of percent in the health care trend rate would not have a material impact upon the nonpension postretirement expense 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations as to which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit and the expiration of a statute of limitation 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses 
during  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our us deferred income tax assets 
in addition  we have valuation allowances against certain deferred income tax assets in the netherlands and mexico 
derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks  including risks related to interest rates and commodity prices 
accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that  at inception and over the term of the arrangement  the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex 
failure to apply this complex guidance will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings  without regard to the offsetting in the fair value of the hedged item 
the accompanying financial statements reflect consequences of loss hedge accounting for certain positions 
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting  we first determine whether the relationship meets the strict criteria to qualify for exemption from ongoing effectiveness testing 
for a relationship that does not meet these criteria  we test effectiveness at inception and quarterly thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset  within a specified range  changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
if the fair value changes fail this test  we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively 

table of contents stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for fiscal was million 
upon adoption of sfas r  we began estimating the value of employee share based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee share based compensation unit was estimated on the date of grant using this same model for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with sfas the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the use of the black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
see note for additional information 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which changes how business combinations are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas r is effective january  for libbey and will be applied prospectively 
the impact of adopting sfas r will depend on the nature and terms of future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which changes the accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary in consolidated financial statements 
sfas recharacterizes minority interests as noncontrolling interests and requires noncontrolling interests to be classified as a component of shareholders equity 
sfas is effective january  for libbey  and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option of financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas no 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we do not presently expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this statement clarifies how to measure fair value as permitted under other accounting pronouncements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some companies  the application of this statement will change current practice 
we will be required to adopt sfas as of january  we do not presently expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk currency we are exposed to market risks due to changes in currency values  although the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the us dollar 
the currency market risks include devaluations and other major currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  euro  rmb or mexican peso that could reduce the cost competitiveness of our products compared to foreign competition 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our floating debt and have entered into interest rate protection agreements rate agreements with respect to million of debt as a means to manage our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the rate agreements effectively convert a portion of our long term borrowings from variable rate debt to fixed rate 
table of contents debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
we had million of debt subject to fluctuating interest rates at december  a change of one percentage point in such rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
if the counterparties to these rate agreements were to fail to perform  we would no longer be protected from interest rate fluctuations by these rate agreements 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
all counterparties were rated aa or better as of december  by standard and poors 
natural gas we are also exposed to market risks associated with changes in the price of natural gas 
we use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future natural gas requirements of our manufacturing operations 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse price movements in the underlying natural gas commodity 
we consider the forecasted natural gas requirements of our manufacturing operations in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast eligible to be hedged  typically ranging from percent to percent of our anticipated requirements  generally six or more months in the future 
for our natural gas requirements that are not hedged  we are subject to changes in the price of natural gas  which affect our earnings 
if the counter parties to these futures contracts were to fail to perform  we would no longer be protected from natural gas fluctuations by the futures contracts 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by these counter parties 
all counterparties were rated aa or better as of december  by standard and poors 
retirement plans we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets 
changes in long term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure our benefit obligations and related expense 
changes in the equity and debt securities markets affect the performance of our pension plans asset performance and related pension expense 
sensitivity to these key market risk factors is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change our total expense by approximately million 
a change of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million
