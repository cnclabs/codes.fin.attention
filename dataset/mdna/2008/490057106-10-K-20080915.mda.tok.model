item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these product recalls caused an adverse affect to our net sales and operating results during fiscal in addition to lost sales directly resulting from recalls  and the direct expenses associated with such resolution  a recall may have other materially adverse  and potentially longer term effects  including a negative impact on our reputation in the marketplace with respect to these and other of our products  changes to future product marketing plans  changes to clinical trial plans  and discontinuation of the recalled products 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
we use hazardous substances in our research and development and manufacturing operations  and  therefore  are potentially subject to material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that could be caused by hazardous substance releases or exposures at or from our facility 
decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities could substantially impair our business and operating results 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived directly or indirectly from international markets 
st 
jude medical derives a significant portion of its angio seal revenue from international markets 
many of our other biomaterials products are also sold by our customers in international markets 
our sales and royalties from international sales of the angio seal product line by st 
jude medical and our revenues from our other international sales are subject to several risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  reimbursement policies  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  
table of contents fluctuations in exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm st 
jude medical s or our future international sales 
our business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel 
our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  including managerial  sales and technical personnel 
the know how and capabilities of many of our current employees is highly specialized and difficult to replicate or replace in short timeframes 
we compete for key personnel with other companies  healthcare institutions  and other organizations 
our ability to maintain and expand our business may be impaired if we are unable to retain our current key personnel or hire or retain other qualified personnel in the future 
our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
our operations are expanding and we expect this trend to continue as we execute our business strategy 
executing our business plan has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  operational  information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  customer support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or harm our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of any acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that could otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
furthermore  we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary substantially in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including ordering patterns by our customers partners the focus and resources that our customers partners place on developing marketing the products that we develop and manufacture  acceptance of the products we develop and manufacture in the end user marketplace  our ability to attract partners for our biomaterials products and technologies  our efforts to gain ce mark and fda approval for any future generations of endovascular or biomaterials devices  
table of contents the loss of significant orders  changes in our relationship with st 
jude medical and other major customers  establishment of strategic alliances or acquisitions  timely implementation of new and improved products  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  reimbursement rates for our products  and changes in the competitive environment 
you should not rely upon our results of operations for any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights  our reputation and competitiveness in the marketplace may be materially damaged 
we regard our patents  biomaterials trade secrets and other intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely upon patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
although we have registered certain of our patents with applicable international governmental authorities  effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available  and we have not sought protection for our intellectual property in every country where our products may be sold 
the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to ensure that third parties will not infringe or otherwise violate our patents or similar proprietary rights 
we may be accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and any related litigation could materially damage our operating results and business 
third parties may claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings brought against us could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
the validity of our patents may be challenged by a competitor 
third parties may claim that one of our patents is invalid based on their prior disclosure or that of another party  whether such disclosure is in a patent application or not 
this type of challenge may be made in any country where our patents are issued 
while we undertake to search the prior art  there is no guarantee that we find all existing incidences of disclosure of devices or technologies related to our inventions 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
we do not own or control the use of the angio seal device trademark 
the term angio seal is a trademark of st 
jude medical 
all goodwill generated by the marketing and sales of devices bearing the angio seal trademark belongs to st 
jude medical and not to us 
should the st 
jude medical license agreements terminate  we would not have the right to call any of our products angio seal unless we purchase or license the trademark from st 
jude medical 

table of contents risks related to our industry we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk that human subjects in clinical testing or consumers of the products may suffer serious bodily injury or death due to side effects or other unintended negative reactions to our products 
accordingly  the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of our products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant product liability litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we face uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement for our products 
we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payers  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our angio seal products are used 
physicians  hospitals and other users of our products may fail to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payers for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes may occur in governmental and private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for these procedures 
the decision by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms not to reimburse for treatment of asymptomatic patients suffering from carotid artery disease was a major factor in our decision not to continue to commercialize our embolic protection product line 
similar decisions  or changes to reimbursement policy  could harm our business 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products or cause us to withdraw products from certain markets 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell new products  satisfy these agencies requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials in connection with our existing products  comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are found to be out of compliance with fda regulations  it could be costly and difficult for us to correct the non compliances and could seriously harm our business 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may also limit the indications for which our products are promoted 
these regulatory agencies may restrict or withdraw approvals if information becomes available to support this action  which could include actions based on sourcing of animal derived tissue 

table of contents risks related to our securities the trading price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including changes in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts  our customers and licensees ability to meet or exceed the forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  our ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical device industry  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical device companies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the market for our stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
as a result  you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price at which you purchase them 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if any securities litigation is initiated against us  with or without merit  we could incur substantial costs  and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders

overview we provide an extensive range of products into multiple medical markets  primarily in the cardiovascular markets  the orthopaedic markets of sports medicine  spine and extremities  and the endovascular markets 
the products we place into these markets include a range of resorbable biomaterials products  primarily for the cardiology and orthopaedic markets  as well as a line of products for the endovascular markets  including devices with applications in the thrombectomy and chronic total occlusion markets 
our revenues consist of two components net sales  which includes biomaterials and endovascular products  and royalty income 
net sales biomaterials sales the sale of angio seal components to st 
jude medical and sales of biomaterial orthopaedic products  including products with applications primarily in the sports medicine and spine markets  continue to be our primary source of revenue 
the table below shows the five year trend in our angio seal component and orthopaedic product sales fiscal year ended change fy vs fy in thousands sales of angio seal components orthopaedic products other products total net sales biomaterials we manufacture two of the key resorbable components of the angio seal for st 
jude medical  of their supply requirements for the collagen plug and at least of their requirements for the polymer anchors  under a supply contract that expires in december sales to st 
jude medical  however  are highly dependent on ordering patterns and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this variation in their ordering patterns was apparent in fiscal as demonstrated by the decrease of sales of these components from fiscal in fiscal  we had exceptionally strong sales due in part to anchor orders that exceeded the contractual minimums 
we expect sales of angio seal components to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales due to increased st 
jude end user sales for the comparable period 
our orthopaedic product sales increased in fiscal from fiscal this was due to an increase in sales of our current product lines  in part due to an increase in our customer base and new product lines for our current customers 
we expect sales of our orthopaedic products to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to our devotion of resources and focus on new business development  new technologies  and innovation for our current customers 

table of contents our net sales in the orthopaedic portion of our business are dependent on several factors  including the success of our current partners in the sports medicine and spine markets and the continued acceptance of biomaterials based products in these two markets  as well as expanded future acceptance of such products and our ability to offer new products and technologies and attract new partners in these markets 
due to these dependencies  or other factors  sales to our orthopaedic customers can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
endovascular sales over the last several years  kensey nash has devoted significant resources to bringing a family of proprietary endovascular products to market in the us and europe 
these products are focused in the emerging markets of thrombectomy and chronic total occlusions ctos 
sales of endovascular products increased to of total net sales in fiscal compared to of total net sales in fiscal on may   we completed a sale of these product lines to spectranetics 
the transaction included a manufacturing agreement  under which we will continue to manufacture some of the endovascular products for spectranetics for a minimum of three years 
therefore  we will continue to recognize endovascular product sales revenue as we ship product to spectranetics for the length of the manufacturing agreement 
these sales will  however  be at a reduced transfer price compared to the direct to market price reflected in our historical sales figures 
see also sale of endovascular business above for a discussion of changes to our endovascular product line platform and how it impacted our results of operations 
royalty income our company also derives a significant portion of our revenue and profitability from royalty income from proprietary products that we have developed or co developed 
angio seal royalty income 
we were the inventor and original developer of the angio seal vascular closure device angio seal  a device that reduces recovery time and enhances patient comfort following both diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular catheterizations 
st 
jude medical  inc has the exclusive worldwide rights for the development  manufacturing and sales and marketing of the angio seal  pursuant to an agreement which provides us with a royalty on all end user product sales 
we anticipate sales of the angio seal device to continue a modest growth pattern  based on forecasted continued procedure growth  st 
jude medical s continued expansion in international markets  and its potential success marketing new generations of the product 
vitoss foam  vitoss  and bioactive vitoss foam royalty income 
since  we have partnered with orthovita  inc to co develop and commercialize a series of unique and proprietary bone void filler products  branded vitoss foam  the first of which was launched in march we receive a fixed royalty on orthovita s end user sales of vitoss foam products  which are targeted for use in the orthopaedic market 
in addition  in august we entered into an agreement to acquire the proprietary rights of a third party inventor of the vitoss technology for million the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  we receive an additional royalty from orthovita on the end user sales of all orthovita products containing the vitoss technology  up to a total royalty to be received of million  with approximately  received in fiscal and million remaining to be received as of june  we believe the unique technology associated with the vitoss foam products and the growing orthopaedic market will result in the orthovita component of our royalty income becoming more significant over the next fiscal year and beyond 
we have other royalty generating relationships  none of which materially contributes to revenue at this time  but which we expect to provide increased revenue as the related products gain market acceptance and additional products are commercialized 

table of contents sale of endovascular business as described under item business overview sale of endovascular business  we completed the sale of our endovascular business to spectranetics corporation on may   receiving million in closing payments  an opportunity for up to an additional million in various research and development and sales related milestone payments  as well as additional royalty payments based on future sales of the thromcat and safecross products 
the transaction also included a manufacturing and development and regulatory services agreement 
discontinuance of embolic protection platform as described under item business overview discontinuance of embolic protection platform  and as announced on july   we made a strategic decision to cease all activities related to our embolic protection platform and recorded certain charges during fiscal and related to this discontinuance 
new facility in fiscal  we successfully completed construction of and moved our operations to a new facility  which resulted in significant facility transition expenses  including the acceleration of depreciation of certain abandoned leasehold improvement assets at our previous locations and moving charges 
the impact of acceleration of depreciation charges was million during fiscal in addition  we incurred moving costs totaling  in fiscal the transition to the new facility was completed in fiscal  and  accordingly  no additional facility transition charges were recorded in fiscal or fiscal these facility transition charges represented a significant portion of our operating expenses in fiscal and therefore we have included the following table to show the facility transition charges included within each operating expense category of our income statement for the fiscal year ended june  facility transition fiscal year ended june  cost of products sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total facility transition charges stock based compensation the following table summarizes total stock based compensation expense  as a result of our required adoption of sfas r in fiscal year  within each operating expense category of our income statements for the fiscal years presented stock based compensation fiscal year ended june  cost of products sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation expense 
table of contents acceleration of stock awards as we publicly announced on september   there was a change in control as defined in our fifth amended and restated kensey nash corporation employee incentive compensation plan the kensey nash corporation employee incentive compensation plan  as amended through the relevant date  the employee plan due to the purchase in the open market by an institutional investor of more than of our shares of outstanding stock 
as a result  all outstanding unvested stock options  stock appreciation rights and nonvested stock held by officers  employees  directors and others under this plan automatically became vested and  in the case of options and stock appreciation rights  exercisable in full 
the accelerated vesting resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million  or per share tax affected  primarily during the quarter ended september  the acceleration removed all future equity compensation expense related to the then outstanding stock options and nonvested shares under the plan as of the date of acceleration 
however  all cash settled stock appreciation rights  including the rights in which the vesting was accelerated  will continue to be marked to market on a quarterly basis  as required under generally accepted accounting principles and equity compensation expense will be incurred related to all new stock compensation awards granted after this event 
see liquidity and capital resources stock appreciation rights sars buyback program below 
the charge represented a significant portion of our operating expenses in fiscal  and  therefore  we have broken it out in the table below to show the acceleration of stock based compensation charges included within each operating expense category of our income statement for the fiscal year ended june  the following table summarizes stock based compensation expense under sfas r in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  and stock based compensation excluding acceleration charge acceleration of stock based compensation charge as reported stock based compensation as reported stock based compensation fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  cost of products sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense per share critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  which superseded sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we also follow the provisions of emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  for collaborative arrangements containing multiple revenue elements that were entered into  or materially amended  after june  sales revenue 
sales revenue is recognized when the related product is shipped or the service is completed 
advance payments received for products or services are recorded as deferred revenue and are 
table of contents recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed  the timing of which could be subjective 
we reduce sales for estimated customer returns  discounts and other allowances  if applicable 
our products are primarily manufactured according to our customers specifications and are subject to return only for failure to meet those specifications 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold 
we recognize substantially all of our royalty revenue at the end of each month  in accordance with our customer agreements 
see note revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we use various forms of equity compensation  including stock options  nonvested stock grants  and cash settled stock appreciation rights  as a major part of our compensation programs to retain and provide incentives to our top management team members and other employees 
fair value of option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses weighted average assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock  and other factors 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of options is derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasuries with constant maturities in effect at the time of grant 
nonvested stock granted to non employee members of our board of directors  executive officers and other management is accounted for using the fair value method under sfas r 
fair value for nonvested stock grants is based upon the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
cash settled sars awarded in stock based payment transactions are accounted for under sfas r  which classifies these awards as liabilities 
accordingly  we record these awards as a component of other non current liabilities on the balance sheet 
for liability awards  the fair value of the award  which determines the measurement of the liability on the balance sheet  is remeasured at each reporting period until the award is settled 
fluctuations in the fair value of the liability award are recorded as increases or decreases in compensation cost  either immediately or over the remaining service period  depending on the vested status of the award 
the expected term of cash settled stock appreciation rights has been determined using the simplified method in accordance with question of sec staff accounting bulletin topic  expected term sab  until such time that historical exercise behavior can be established 
we believe that this calculation provides a reasonable estimate of the expected term 
on december   sab was issued to extend the simplified method beyond for those companies which have concluded that their own historical exercise experience is not sufficient to provide a reasonable basis 
revisions to any of our estimates or methodologies could cause a material impact to our financial statements 
accounting for investments in debt and equity securities 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets and report the portfolio at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity and realized gains and losses in other income 
we currently have investment securities with fair values that are less than their amortized cost and therefore contain unrealized losses 
we have evaluated these securities and have determined that the decline in value is not related to any company or industry specific event 
we anticipate full recovery of amortized costs with respect to these securities at maturity or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment 
revisions to our classification of these investments and or a determination other than the anticipation of a full recovery of the amortized costs at maturity or sooner 
table of contents could result in our realizing gains and losses on these investments and  therefore  have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all of its affirmative  restrictive and financial maintenance covenants 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances  to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality concerns 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes 
our estimated effective tax rate includes the impact of certain estimated research and development tax credits and non taxable interest income 
material changes in  or differences from  our estimates could impact our estimate of our effective tax rate 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and total revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal total net sales 
net sales of products increased to million for fiscal compared to net sales of million for fiscal we had a increase in our biomaterials sales and a increase in our endovascular sales 
biomaterials sales 
biomaterials sales were million in fiscal  a increase compared to million in fiscal biomaterials sales includes revenue recognized from products shipped as well as revenue generated from product development programs with biomaterials customers 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in orthopaedic sales of million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the orthopaedic sales growth was primarily the result of sales to arthrex  inc of million  which represented an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
additionally  sales to orthovita increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to strong end user sales of existing products and initial shipments for the new vitoss bioactive foam product line which was fully launched by orthovita in the fourth quarter of fiscal the fiscal orthopaedic sales growth was also impacted by million of new product sales resulting from our macropore biosurgery assets acquisition  completed in may other biomaterials sales increased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal offsetting these increases was a million  or  decrease in sales of angio seal components to st

as we look ahead to fiscal  we believe that higher volumes  process improvements and process automation will lead to further improvement in the costs for our products  but that these improvements will be offset by lower margins on our endovascular products due to our reduced pricing structure with spectranetics see item overview endovascular sales above

the exercise price of each sar is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant

the first one third of these grants was scheduled to vest during our quarter ended september  during the quarter ended september   the vesting of all equity compensation awards automatically accelerated due to the change in control as defined under the employee plan 
see note stock based compensation to the consolidated financial statements included in this k for additional information concerning the accelerated vesting of all equity awards

general we plan to continue to increase our research and development activities for our biomaterial products and increase our research and development activities for our endovascular products based on our development contract with spectranetics 
since we have sold our endovascular product lines to spectranetics  the portion of our operating expense specifically related to sales and marketing efforts will be virtually eliminated in fiscal we believe our current cash and investment balances and future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing  and capital requirements for the next months 
although we believe our cash and investment balances will also be sufficient on a longer term basis  that will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  the costs associated with that commercialization  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  future clinical trials and product clearance by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to expand our manufacturing  sales  and marketing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products 
the terms of any future equity financing we undertake may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financing may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects  as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
investment portfolio our investment portfolio consists of high quality municipal securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities ranging from less than one year to approximately four and a half years 
at june  we also had one remaining municipal variable rate demand obligation with a maturity of years 
this municipal variable rate demand obligation was putable weekly and callable on a monthly basis 
on august   this variable rate demand obligation was called at par value 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with secondary or resale markets 
we have an audit committee approved investment strategy  which currently limits the duration and types of our investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decreases in market value if interest rates increase 
as of june   our total investment portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments 
while our investments may be sold at any time because the portfolio includes available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets  we generally hold securities until the earlier of their call date or their maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
additional information regarding our investments is located in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
debt on may   we entered into a million aggregate ten year fixed interest rate swap agreement the swap  with citibank  na  to manage the market risk from changes in interest rates under the mortgage 
as of june  we have taken the full million advance under the mortgage see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our objective and strategy for undertaking the swap was to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows and interest expense associated with the future interest rate payments under the mortgage and to reduce our interest rate risk in the event of an unfavorable interest rate environment 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
additional information regarding the swap is located in note under derivative instruments and hedging activities
