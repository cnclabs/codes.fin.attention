supervision and regulation the banking industry is highly regulated 
statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income 
the following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on valley or vnb 
it is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions 
bank holding company regulation valley is a bank holding company within the meaning of the holding company act 
as a bank holding company  valley is supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb and is required to file reports with the frb and provide such additional information as the frb may require 
the holding company act prohibits valley  with certain exceptions  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking  managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks  except that it may  upon application  engage in  and may own shares of companies engaged in  certain businesses found by the frb to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
the holding company act requires prior approval by the frb of the acquisition by valley of more than five percent of the voting stock of any other bank 
satisfactory capital ratios and community reinvestment act ratings and anti money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions 
the policy of the frb provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy 
acquisitions through vnb require approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency of the united states occ 
the holding company act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
the gramm leach bliley act  discussed below  allows valley to expand into insurance  securities  merchant banking activities  and other activities that are financial in nature 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of interstate banking and branching act enables bank holding companies to acquire banks in states other than its home state  regardless of applicable state law 
the interstate banking and branching act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines  thereby creating interstate banks with branches in more than one state 
under the legislation  each state had the opportunity to opt out of this provision 
furthermore  a state may opt in with respect to de novo branching  thereby permitting a bank to open new branches in a state in which the bank does not already have a branch 
without de novo branching  an out of state commercial bank can enter the state only by acquiring an existing bank or branch 
the vast majority of states have allowed interstate banking by merger but have not authorized de novo branching 
new jersey enacted legislation to authorize interstate banking and branching and the entry into new jersey of foreign country banks 
new jersey did not authorize de novo branching into the state 
however  under federal law  federal savings banks which meet certain conditions may branch de novo into a state  regardless of state law 
regulation of bank subsidiary vnb is subject to the supervision of  and to regular examination by  the occ 
various laws and the regulations thereunder applicable to valley and its bank subsidiary impose restrictions and requirements in many areas  including capital requirements  the maintenance of reserves  establishment of new offices  the making of loans and investments  consumer protection  employment practices  bank acquisitions and entry into new types of business 
there are various legal limitations  including sections a and b of the federal reserve act  which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its holding company s non bank subsidiaries 
under federal law  no bank subsidiary may  subject to certain limited exceptions  make loans or extensions of credit to  or investments in the securities of  its parent or the non bank subsidiaries of its parent other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower 
each bank subsidiary is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loans or extensions of credit permitted by such exceptions 
dividend limitations valley is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
valley s revenues on a parent company only basis result in substantial part from dividends paid by vnb 
vnb dividend payments  without prior regulatory approval  are subject to regulatory limitations 
under the national bank act  dividends may be declared only if  after payment thereof  capital would be unimpaired and remaining surplus would equal percent of capital 
moreover  a national bank may declare  in any one year  dividends only in an amount aggregating not more than the sum of its net profits for such year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit vnb from paying dividends or otherwise supplying funds to valley if the supervising agency determines that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
loans to related parties vnb s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers and percent stockholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of the national bank act  sarbanes oxley act and regulation o of the frb thereunder 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders i be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and ii not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of vnb s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by vnb s board of directors 
under the sarbanes oxley act  valley and its subsidiaries  other than vnb  may not extend or arrange for any personal loans to its directors and executive officers 
community reinvestment under the community reinvestment act cra  as implemented by occ regulations  a national bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires the occ  in connection with its examination of a national bank  to assess the association s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such association 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
vnb received a satisfactory cra rating in its most recent examination 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of added new legal requirements for public companies affecting corporate governance  accounting and corporate reporting 
the sarbanes oxley act of provides for  among other things a prohibition on personal loans made or arranged by the issuer to its directors and executive officers except for loans made by a bank subject to regulation o  independence requirements for audit committee members  independence requirements for company outside auditors  certification of financial statements within the annual report on form k and quarterly reports on form q by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer  the forfeiture by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by such officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement due to corporate misconduct  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  two business day filing requirements for insiders filing on form  disclosure of a code of ethics for financial officers and filing a current report on form k for a change in or waiver of such code  the reporting of securities violations up the ladder by both in house and outside attorneys  restrictions on the use of non gaap financial measures in press releases and sec filings  the creation of the public company accounting oversight board pcaob  various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws  an assertion by management with respect to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  and a report by the company s external auditor on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
each of the national stock exchanges  including the new york stock exchange nyse where valley s securities are listed  have implemented corporate governance listing standards  including rules strengthening director independence requirements for boards  and requiring the adoption of charters for the nominating  corporate governance and audit committees 
these rules require valley to certify to the nyse that there are no violations of any corporate listing standards 
valley has provided the nyse with the certification required by the nyse rule 
usa patriot act as part of the usa patriot act  congress adopted the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the anti money laundering act 
the anti money laundering act authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks  bank holding companies  broker dealers and insurance companies 
among its other provisions  the anti money laundering act requires each financial institution i to establish an anti money laundering program  ii to establish due diligence policies  procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in united states private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non united states persons or their representatives  and iii to avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the united states for  or on behalf of  a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  the anti money laundering act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
regulations implementing the due diligence requirements  require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records  encourage cooperation among financial institutions  federal banking agencies  and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities  prohibit the anonymous use of concentration accounts  and requires all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti money laundering compliance program 
the occ  along with other banking agencies  have strictly enforced various anti money laundering and suspicious activity reporting requirements using formal and informal enforcement tools to cause banks to comply with these provisions 
the anti money laundering act amended the bank holding company act and the bank merger act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of any financial institution involved in a proposed merger transaction in combating money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts 
regulatory relief law in late  the american home ownership and economic act of instituted a number of regulatory relief provisions applicable to national banks  such as permitting national banks to have classified directors and to merge their business subsidiaries into the bank 
gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of gramm leach bliley act became effective in early the gramm leach bliley act provides for the following allows bank holding companies meeting management  capital and community reinvestment act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non banking activities than was previously permissible  including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies  allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks  removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies  and establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations 
if a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company  it files a certification  effective in days  and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals 
valley has not elected to become a financial holding company 
the occ adopted rules to allow national banks to form subsidiaries to engage in financial activities allowed for financial holding companies 
electing national banks must meet the same management and capital standards as financial holding companies but may not engage in insurance underwriting  real estate development or merchant banking 
sections a and b of the federal reserve act apply to financial subsidiaries and the capital invested by a bank in its financial subsidiaries will be eliminated from the bank s capital in measuring all capital ratios 
vnb wholly owns one financial subsidiary glen rauch securities  inc the gramm leach bliley act modified other financial laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
additional proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking and financial services industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on valley cannot be determined at this time 
firrea under the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea  a depository institution insured by the federal deposit insurance corp fdic can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
these provisions have commonly been referred to as firrea s cross guarantee provisions 
further  under firrea  the failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities 
firrea also imposes certain independent appraisal requirements upon a bank s real estate lending activities and further imposes certain loan to value restrictions on a bank s real estate lending activities 
the bank regulators have promulgated regulations in these areas 
fdicia pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations  specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution 
to qualify to engage in financial activities under the gramm leach bliley act  all depository institutions must be well capitalized 
the financial holding company of a national bank will be put under directives to raise its capital levels or divest its activities if the depository institution falls from that level 
the occ s regulations implementing these provisions of fdicia provide that an institution will be classified as well capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of at least percent  and iv meets certain other requirements 
an institution will be classified as adequately capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of a at least percent or b at least percent if the institution was rated in its most recent examination  and iv does not meet the definition of well capitalized 
an institution will be classified as undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of a less than percent or b less than percent if the institution was rated in its most recent examination 
an institution will be classified as significantly undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of less than percent 
an institution will be classified as critically undercapitalized if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than percent 
an insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating 
similar categories apply to bank holding companies 
in addition  significant provisions of fdicia required federal banking regulators to impose standards in a number of other important areas to assure bank safety and soundness  including internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  credit underwriting  asset growth  compensation  loan documentation and interest rate exposure 
item a 
risk factors an investment in valley s common stock is subject to risks inherent to valley s business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect valley are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing valley 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently believes are immaterial may also impair valley s business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  valley s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in interest rates can have an adverse effect on profitability valley s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond valley s control  including general economic conditions  competition  and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the policies of the frb 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest valley receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i valley s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of valley s financial assets and liabilities  including the held to maturity  available for sale  and trading securities portfolios  and iii the average duration of valley s interest earning assets 
this also includes the risk that interest earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest bearing liabilities  or vice versa repricing risk  the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk  and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability maturities yield curve risk  including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on valley s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on valley s financial condition and results of operations 
see net interest income and interest rate sensitivity sections in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to valley s management of interest rate risk 
competition in the financial services industry valley faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than valley 
valley competes with other providers of financial services such as commercial and savings banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  money market and mutual funds  mortgage companies  title agencies  asset managers  insurance companies and a growing list of other local  regional and national institutions which offer financial services 
mergers between financial institutions within new jersey and in neighboring states have added competitive pressure 
if valley is unable to compete effectively  it will lose market share and income generated from loans  deposits  and other financial products will decline 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the potential that valley will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due  capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise  or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is required to fund various obligations  including credit obligations to borrowers  mortgage originations  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt  dividends to shareholders  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources 
valley s liquidity can be affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  market disruption  operational problems affecting third parties or valley  unfavorable pricing  competition  valley s credit rating and regulatory restrictions 
loss of lower cost funding sources checking and savings  now  and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market  as providing a better risk return tradeoff 
if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments  valley could lose a relatively low cost source of funds  increasing its funding costs and reducing valley s net interest income and net income 
changes in primary market areas could adversely impact results of operations and financial condition much of valley s lending is in northern and central new jersey and new york city 
as a result of this geographic concentration  a significant broad based deterioration in economic conditions in new jersey and the new york city metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of valley s loan portfolio  and accordingly  valley s results of operations 
such a decline in economic conditions could restrict borrowers ability to pay outstanding principal and interest on loans when due  and  consequently  adversely affect the cash flows of valley s business 
valley s loan portfolio is largely secured by real estate collateral 
a substantial portion of the real and personal property securing the loans in valley s portfolio is located in new jersey and new york city 
conditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for valley s loans are located strongly influence the level of valley s non performing loans and results of operations 
a decline in the new jersey and new york city metropolitan area real estate markets  as well as the other external factors  could adversely affect valley s loan portfolio 
allowance for loan losses may be insufficient valley maintains an allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  national and regional economic conditions  historical loss experience and delinquency trends 
however  valley cannot predict loan losses with certainty  and valley cannot provide assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses 
if net charge offs exceed valley s allowance  its earnings would decrease 
in addition  regulatory agencies review valley s allowance for loan losses and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
valley management could also decide that the allowance for loan losses should be increased 
an increase in valley s allowance for loan losses could reduce its earnings 
potential acquisitions may disrupt valley s business and dilute stockholder value valley regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of valley s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on valley s financial condition and results of operations 
valley seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar  have experienced management and possess either a market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to valley s business  potential diversion of valley s management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company 
implementation of growth strategies valley has a strategic branch expansion initiative to expand its physical presence in new york city  including entry into new market areas located in kings and queens counties  new york  and fill in its markets within new jersey 
additionally in  valley expanded the geographic presence of its auto loan dealer network into connecticut  which network already includes pennsylvania  florida  new york  and new jersey 
valley can provide no assurances that it will successfully implement these initiatives 
valley s ability to successfully execute these initiatives depends upon a variety of factors  including its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel  the continued availability of desirable business opportunities and locations  the competitive responses from other financial institutions in valley s new market areas  and the ability to manage growth 
these initiatives could cause valley s expenses to increase faster than revenues 
there are considerable initial and on going costs involved in opening branches  growing loans in new markets  and attracting new deposit relationships 
these expenses could negatively impact future earnings 
for example  it takes time for new branches and relationships to achieve profitability 
expenses could be further increased if there are delays in the opening of new branches or if attraction strategies are more costly than expected 
delays in opening new branches can be caused by a number of factors such as the inability to find suitable locations  zoning and construction delays  and success in attracting qualified personnel to staff the new branch 
in addition  there is no assurance that a new branch will be successful even after it has been established 
from time to time  valley may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed 
valley may invest significant time and resources to develop and market new lines of business and or products and services 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services many not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting customer preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
additionally  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of valley s system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on valley s business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in accounting policies or accounting standards valley s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of valley s assets or liabilities and financial results 
valley identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
under each of these policies  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  using different assumptions  or as new information becomes available 
for a description of valley s critical accounting policies  refer to critical accounting policies and estimates at item of this report 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of valley s external financial statements 
in addition  accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb  sec  banking regulators and valley s outside auditors may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond valley s control  can be hard to predict and could materially impact how valley reports its financial results and condition 
in certain cases  valley could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently also retroactively which may result in valley restating prior period financial statements in material amounts 
extensive regulation and supervision valley  primarily through its principal subsidiary  vnb  and certain non bank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole 
such laws are not designed to protect valley shareholders 
these regulations affect valley s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
valley is also subject to a number of federal laws  which  among other things  require it to lend to various sectors of the economy and population  and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti money laundering and customer identification 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect valley in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject valley to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on valley s business  financial condition and results of operations 
valley s compliance with certain of these laws will be considered by banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions 
while valley has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
