item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have been focused on creating a portfolio of businesses that provides greater consistency of performance  improved profitability and sustainable growth 
to accomplish this  in we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to improve margins  reduce cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our core businesses 
we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through our internal growth initiatives which include the development of new products  expansion of market share  moving existing products into new geographies  and through selected acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability to grow market share 
the teleflex portfolio of businesses changed significantly in with acquisitions in all three business segments and significant divestitures in both commercial and aerospace 
during  in our medical segment  we completed the acquisition of arrow international  a medical products company with annual revenues of over million  which significantly expanded the segment 
we also completed the acquisition of a small orthopedic device manufacturer to expand our capability to serve medical device manufacturers 
in our commercial segment  we acquired a rigging services business with annual revenues of approximately million 
at the end of the fiscal year  we completed the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses with revenues of over million  significantly reducing the size of our commercial segment 
in our aerospace segment  we acquired a cargo equipment business with annual revenues of approximately million and divested a precision machined components business with approximately million in revenues 
the following bullet points summarize our more significant acquisitions and divestitures in and  and the results for the acquired businesses are included in the respective segments

results of operations discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition 
activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth 
core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelve month period 
the following comparisons exclude the impact of the teleflex aerospace manufacturing group tamg  the automotive and industrial driver control  motion systems and fluid handling systems business  the automotive pedal systems business  the sermatech international business  a european medical product sterilization business and a small medical business  which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note for discussion of discontinued operations

the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized

see also note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates 
based upon these judgments and estimates  we record a reserve to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our inventory reserve was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for long lived assets and investments the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill 
in addition  we test our other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of future performance  long term discount rates and market price valuation multiples 
these estimates will likely change over time 
several of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality 
goodwill and other intangible assets totaled  million and million at december  and december   respectively 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of arrow international  the company recorded a million charge to operations during  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  for in process research and development ipr d assets acquired that the company determined had no alternative future use in their current state 
as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation for arrow  approximately million of the purchase price has been allocated to acquire in process research and development projects 
the amount allocated to the acquired in process research and development represents the estimated value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  the company may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects 
the value assigned to the acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rate of percent utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the company s acquisition model plus a risk premium 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects  appropriate risk adjusted discount rates were used for the in process research and development projects 
the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology projects 
the purchased in process technology of arrow relates to research and development projects in the following product families central venus access catheters cvc and specialty care catheters specialty care 
the most significant purchased set of in process technologies relates to the cvc product family for which the company has estimated a value of million 
the projects included in this product family s in process technology include the hi c project  picc triple lumen  antimicrobial picc  and the elcam catheter tip positioning technology 
it is anticipated that cvc in process technologies will begin producing revenues sometime in  subject to receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals 
material net cash inflows net of operating costs  including costs to complete clinical trials from the use of the cvc in process technologies are expected to commence in the estimated remaining total costs to complete these clinical trials are expected to be approximately million 
the remaining purchased set of in process technologies relates to the specialty care product family for which the company has estimated a value of million 
the projects included in this product family s in process technology include the ethanol lock program and antimicrobial chdc

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
a basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased the total net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense for by approximately million and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased these amounts by approximately million and million  respectively 
a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would have impacted annual pension expense by approximately million 
a increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have increased the benefit expense by approximately million and would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately million
