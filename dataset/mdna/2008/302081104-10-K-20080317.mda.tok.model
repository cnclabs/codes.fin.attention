table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business we have a limited number of clients and provide services to few industries 
in  of our total revenues came from two clients 
we have derived and believe that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in  our two largest clients  norwich union and centrica  accounted for of our total revenues under several contracts 
we generated of our total revenues in from norwich union and of our total revenues in from centrica 
we provide services to norwich union under two framework agreements and work orders generated by these agreements 
the first framework agreement and all work orders under that agreement cannot be terminated by our client without cause prior to may the second framework agreement expires in july and can be terminated by our client without cause upon six months prior notice and payment to us of a break up fee during its initial term 
after these initial terms  norwich union may terminate these agreements without cause or penalty with six months notice 
we provide services to centrica under an agreement that has an initial term that expires in january and that can be terminated by centrica for cause only during its initial term 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients in the near future 
the loss or financial difficulties of any of our large clients would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
a substantial portion of our bpo clients are concentrated in the insurance  banking and financial services sector 
in  of our bpo revenues were derived from clients in those industries  including of our bpo revenues that were derived from clients in the insurance industry 
our business and growth largely depend on continued demand for our services from clients and potential clients in these industries and those industries where we are focusing expansion efforts  such as utilities  healthcare  telecommunications and transportation 
these industries have been cyclical and vulnerable to significant downturns in the past  and adverse developments in these industries could unfavorably affect our business 
other developments  such as consolidation  particularly involving our clients  could also cause the demand for our services in these industries to decline 
in addition  our agreement with norwich union also contains certain restrictions limited in duration or scope on our ability to provide services to certain competitors of this entity without the approval of this entity 
our agreements with our largest client give it the option to assume the operations of one of our facilities and operating subsidiaries  and the exercise of that option could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
under one of our agreements with norwich union  our largest client  norwich union has the option from may through february to purchase the shares of our subsidiary that operates one of our facilities in pune  india  by paying us an amount approximating the net asset value of that facility on the date of transfer 
the affected facility generated of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in norwich union has recently exercised its option to assume the operations of the facilities of two of its third party vendor contractors and has publicly announced its intention to undertake a strategic review of its indian operations  which could result in norwich union electing to modify or terminate its relationship with us 
in addition  under our other agreement with norwich union  it also has the option to purchase certain of the assets of our operating subsidiary exlservice 
com india private limited  an indian corporation  which we refer to as exl india  for the book value of those assets if we are in a material default of our agreement and such default affects the insurance services provided by more than of our full time employees or prejudices or is likely to prejudice the reputation of norwich union or its affiliates  or if there is a change of control that is not approved by norwich union 
the exercise of either of these options would result in both a loss of revenues and a loss of our employees who are at that time working in the related facilities 

table of contents we may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations  as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates 
the bpo industry is very labor intensive and our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain qualified employees  including our ability to attract employees with needed skills in the geographic areas in which we operate 
the industry  including us  experiences high employee turnover 
in  our turnover rate for billable employees was approximately 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
increased competition for these professionals  in the bpo industry or otherwise  could have an adverse effect on us 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to provide bpo services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins  and could lead to a decline in demand for our services 
high turnover rates generally do not impact our revenues as we factor the attrition rate into our pricing models by maintaining additional employees for each process 
however  high turnover rates do increase our cost of revenues and therefore impact our profit margins due to higher recruitment  training and retention costs as a result of maintaining larger hiring  training and human resources departments and higher operating costs due to having to reallocate certain business processes among our operating facilities where we have access to the skilled workforce needed for the business 
in  we incurred approximately million on recruitment and approximately million on training costs due to employee turnover  thereby increasing our cost of revenues and reducing our profit margins for that period by million 
in addition  competition for outsourcing professionals in the philippines  where we are in the process of establishing a new operations facility that we expect to become operational during the second quarter of  is expected to increase as additional outsourcing companies and other companies with a demand for college educated personnel  enter the market and expand their operations 
in addition  our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend  in large part  on our ability to attract  train and retain personnel with skills that keep pace with the demand for outsourcing  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
a lack of sufficiently qualified personnel could also inhibit our ability to establish operations in new markets and our efforts to expand geographically 
our failure to attract  train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services  which requires significant investment of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
our clients then evaluate our services before deciding whether to use them 
therefore  our selling cycle  which generally ranges from six to months  is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control  including our clients decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other providers or in house offshore resources and the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully conclude a contract after the selling cycle is complete 
implementing our services involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations  thereby delaying further the implementation process 
our clients and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services  and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents once we are engaged by a client  it may take us several months before we start to recognize significant revenues 
when we are engaged by a client after the selling process  it takes from four to six weeks to integrate the client s systems with ours  and up to three months thereafter to build up our services to the client s requirements 
depending on the complexity of the processes being implemented  these time periods may be significantly longer 
implementing processes can be subject to potential delays similar to certain of those affecting the selling cycle 
therefore  we do not recognize significant revenues until after we have completed the implementation phase 
we enter into long term contracts with our bpo clients  and our failure to estimate the resources and time required for our contracts may negatively affect our profitability 
the initial terms of our bpo client contracts typically range from three to seven years 
in many of our bpo contracts we commit to long term pricing with our clients and therefore bear the risk of cost overruns  completion delays  wage inflation and adverse movements in exchange rates in connection with these contracts 
if we fail to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a contract  future wage inflation rates or currency exchange rates or if we fail to complete our contractual obligations within the contracted timeframe  our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected 
consistency in our revenues from period to period depends in part on our ability to reflect the changing demands and needs of our existing and potential bpo clients 
if we are unable to adjust our pricing terms or the mix of products and services we provide to meet the changing demands of our bpo clients and potential bpo clients  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
most of our bpo contracts use a pricing model that provides for hourly or annual billing rates 
industry pricing models are evolving  however  and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request transaction based pricing 
this pricing model will place additional pressure on the efficiency of our service delivery so that we can maintain reasonable operating margins 
if we are unable to adapt our operations to evolving pricing protocols  our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors 
in addition  the bpo services we provide to our clients particularly under our general framework agreements  and the revenues and income from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts changes over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
furthermore  our clients  some of which have experienced rapid changes in their prospects  substantial price competition and pressures on their profitability  have in the past and may in the future demand price reductions  automate some or all of their processes or change their outsourcing strategy by moving more work in house or to other providers  any of which could reduce our profitability 
any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide to any of our clients  or any requirement to lower our prices  would harm our business 
our transformation services are cyclical and based on specific projects involving short term contracts 
our transformation services  such as our research and analytics services and our advisory services  are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
changes in the deadlines or the scope of work required for compliance with the requirements of legislation applicable to our clients  such as the sarbanes oxley act of  could have a significant impact on certain risk advisory service offerings of our advisory services business 
in addition  our research and analytics services and our advisory services usually consist of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us 
table of contents once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
our operating results may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult for us to make accurate financial forecasts 
our operating results may vary significantly from period to period 
although our existing agreements with original terms of three or more years provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
the timing of revenue recognition under new client agreements also varies depending on when we complete the implementation phase 
the completion of implementation varies significantly based upon the complexity of the processes being implemented 
our period to period results have in the past and may also in the future fluctuate due to other factors  including client losses  delays or failure by our clients to provide anticipated business  variations in employee utilization rates resulting from changes in our clients operations  delays or difficulties in expanding our operational facilities and infrastructure including hiring new employees or constructing new operations centers  changes to our pricing structure or that of our competitors  currency fluctuation  seasonal changes in the operations of our clients and other events identified in this annual report on form k 
our revenues are also affected by changes in pricing under our contracts at the time of renewal or by pricing under new contracts 
for example  because the majority of our revenues are denominated in pounds sterling or us dollars while most of our expenses are incurred and paid in indian rupees  our revenues can decrease or increase significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the pound sterling and the us dollar fluctuate significantly 
in addition  some of our contracts do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
these factors may make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that we do not receive as a result of delays in implementing our services or client losses 
if our actual results do not meet any estimated results that we announce  or if we under perform market expectations as a result of such factors  trading prices for our common stock could be adversely affected 
our senior management team is critical to our continued success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business 
our future success substantially depends on the continued services and performance of the members of our management team and other key employees possessing technical and business capabilities  including industry expertise  that are difficult to replace 
specifically  the loss of the services of our vice chairman and chief executive officer  vikram talwar  or of our president and chief operating officer  rohit kapoor  could seriously impair our ability to continue to manage and expand our business 
there is intense competition for experienced senior management and personnel with technical and industry expertise in the industry in which we operate  and we may not be able to retain these officers or key employees 
although we have entered into employment and non competition agreements with all of our executive officers  certain terms of those agreements may not be enforceable and in any event these agreements do not ensure the continued service of these executive officers 
messrs 
talwar and kapoor and certain of their affiliates have certain registration rights with respect to their shares of common stock 
in addition  we currently do not maintain key person insurance covering any member of our management team 
the loss of any of our key employees  particularly to competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents our inability to effectively manage our rapid infrastructure and personnel growth could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations and financial condition 
since we were founded in april  we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our operations 
we have ten operations facilities in india and us  including a  workstation facility in noida  india  that became operational in july our employees have increased from approximately  on december  to approximately  on december  we expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the locations where we operate in order to address the anticipated growth of our business 
in addition  we are presently in the process of establishing a new operations facility in the philippines that we expect to become operational during the second quarter of we are also looking at additional locations other than india and the philippines to invest in an operations facility 
we believe expanding our geographic base of operations will provide higher value to our clients by decreasing the risks of operating from a single country including potential shortages of skilled employees  increases in wage costs during strong economic times and currency fluctuations  while also giving our clients access to a wider talent pool and establishing a base in countries that may be competitive in the future 
however  we may not be able to effectively manage our infrastructure and employee expansion  open additional operations facilities or hire additional skilled employees as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our clients  and we may not be able to develop and improve our internal systems 
our inability to execute our growth strategy  to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our operations staff and other employees 
for example  wage costs in india have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the united states and europe for comparably skilled professionals  which has been one of our competitive advantages 
however  because of rapid economic growth in india  increased demand for bpo services from india and increased competition for skilled employees in india  wages for comparably skilled employees in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states and europe  which may reduce this competitive advantage 
in addition  as the us dollar declines in value against the indian rupee  wages in the united states will decrease relative to wages in india  which may further reduce our competitive advantage 
we may need to increase the levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the quality and number of employees that our business requires 
wages are generally higher for employees performing research and analytics services and advisory services than for employees performing other bpo services 
as the scale of our research and analytics services and our advisory services increases  wages as a percentage of revenues will likely increase 
wage increases in the long term may reduce our profit margins 
additionally  because substantially all of our employees are based in india and paid in indian rupees  while our revenues are primarily in us dollars and pounds sterling  our employee costs as a percentage of revenues may increase or decrease significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the pound sterling and the us dollar fluctuate significantly 
we face significant competition from us based and us based outsourcing and information technology companies and from our clients  who may perform outsourcing services themselves  either in house  in the united states or through offshore groups or other arrangements 
the market for outsourcing services is highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify and increase from a number of sources 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are price  service quality  sales and marketing skills  the ability to develop customized services and technological and industry expertise 
we face significant competition for our services from our clients own in house groups  including  in some cases  in house groups operating offshore 
for example  norwich union  our largest client  has the option under one of our contracts to purchase the shares of our subsidiary that operates one of our 
table of contents facilities in pune  india 
norwich union has recently exercised its option to assume the operations of the facilities of two of its third party vendor contractors and has publicly announced its intention to undertake a strategic review of its indian operations  which could result in norwich union electing to modify or terminate its relationship with us 
in addition  our total revenues in could be affected by the decision of a limited number of our other clients to move work from third party contractors to in house groups operating offshore or to decrease work from third party contractors as a result of internal strategic restructurings 
we also face competition from non us based outsourcing and it companies including those in the united kingdom and india and us based outsourcing and it companies 
in addition  the trend toward offshore outsourcing  international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuing technological changes will result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
these competitors may include entrants from the communications  software and data networking industries or entrants in geographic locations with lower costs than those in which we operate 
some of these existing and future competitors have greater financial  personnel and other resources  longer operating histories  a broader range of service offerings  greater technological expertise  more recognizable brand names and more established relationships in industries that we currently serve or may serve in the future 
in addition  some of our competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger  more established companies in order to increase their ability to address client needs  or enter into similar arrangements with potential clients 
the trend in multi vendor relationships has been growing  which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other vendors 
increased competition  our inability to compete successfully against competitors  pricing pressures or loss of market share could result in reduced operating margins  which could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may disrupt our clients operations as a result of inadequate service or other factors  including telecommunications or technology downtime or interruptions 
the services we provide are often critical to our clients businesses  and any failure to provide those services could result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure 
in particular  our dependence on our offshore operations centers requires us to maintain active voice and data communications among our operations centers in india and the philippines  our international technology hubs in the united states and our clients offices 
although we maintain redundant facilities and communications links  disruptions could result from  among other things  technical breakdowns  computer glitches and viruses and weather conditions 
we also depend on certain significant vendors for facility storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data at those technology hubs 
any failure by these vendors to perform those services  any temporary or permanent loss of our equipment or systems  or any disruptions to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications could impede our ability to provide services to our clients  have a negative impact on our reputation  cause us to lose clients  reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we may not be fully insured for all losses we may incur 
although we attempt to limit and mitigate our liability for damages arising from negligent acts  errors or omissions through contractual provisions  limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients  are generally not limited under those agreements 
although we have general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions and breaches of privacy and network security  that coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or to be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage  or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and cause us to lose clients 
we are typically required to collect and store sensitive data in connection with our services  including names  addresses  social security numbers  credit card account numbers  checking and savings account numbers and payment history records  such as account closures and returned checks 
in addition  many of our agreements with our clients do not include any limitation on our liability to them with respect to breaches of our obligation to keep the information we receive from them confidential 
we take precautions to protect confidential client and customer data 
however  if any person  including any of our employees  penetrates our network security or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates sensitive data  we could be subject to significant liability and lawsuits from our clients or their own customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws 
penetration of the network security of our data centers could have a negative impact on our reputation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our industry may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction in the united states and elsewhere to offshore outsourcing  recently proposed legislation or otherwise 
we have based our strategy of future growth on certain assumptions regarding our industry and future developments in the market for outsourcing services 
for example  we believe that there will continue to be changes in product and service requirements  and investments in the products offered by our clients will continue to increase 
however  the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse 
offshore outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the united states and elsewhere  and many organizations and public figures have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the united states and elsewhere 
in addition  there has been recent publicity about the negative experience of certain companies that use offshore outsourcing  particularly in india 
current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services to offshore providers to avoid any negative perception that may be associated with using an offshore provider 
any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends would harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that operate out of facilities located in the united states and elsewhere 
a variety of us federal and state legislation has been proposed that  if enacted  could restrict or discourage us companies from outsourcing their services to companies outside the united states 
for example  legislation has been proposed that would require offshore providers to identify where they are located 
because most of our clients are located in the united states  any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing could adversely impact our ability to do business with us clients and have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  it is possible that legislation could be adopted that would restrict us private sector companies that have federal or state government contracts from outsourcing their services to offshore service providers 
such restrictions could affect our ability to attract or retain clients that have such contracts in the future 
in other countries  such as the united kingdom which comprised of our total revenues in  there has also been some negative publicity and concern expressed regarding the possible effect of job losses caused by outsourcing 
legislation introduced in the united kingdom consolidating past case law in provides that if a company transfers or outsources its business or a part of its business to a transferee or a service provider  the employees who were employed in such business are entitled to become employed by the transferee or service provider on the same terms and conditions as they had been employed before the transfer 
the dismissal of such employees as a result of such transfer of business is deemed unfair dismissal and entitles the employees to compensation 
as a result  we may become liable for redundancy payments to the employees of our clients in the united kingdom who outsource business to us 
we are generally indemnified in our existing contracts with clients in the united kingdom to the extent we incur losses or additional costs due to the application of this legislation to us  and we intend to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients 
however  if we are unable to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients  we may be liable under any service level agreements we enter into in the future with united kingdom clients 

table of contents our client contracts contain certain termination provisions that could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we provide services to norwich union under two framework agreements and work orders generated by these agreements 
we generated of our total revenues in from norwich union 
the first framework agreement and all work orders under that agreement cannot be terminated by our client without cause prior to may the second framework agreement expires in july and can be terminated by our client without cause upon six months prior notice and payment to us of a break up fee during its initial term 
after these initial terms  norwich union may terminate these agreements without cause or penalty with six months notice 
cause under the norwich union agreements includes our failure to perform services agreed upon in a specific work order adequately  disposal of our material assets  our filing for bankruptcy or a change of control where our new controlling party is a named competitor of norwich union 
we generated of our total revenues in from centrica 
we provide services to centrica under an agreement that has an initial term that expires in january and that can be terminated by centrica for cause only during its initial term 
contracts with other bpo clients representing approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  will expire prior to december  the termination of a substantial percentage of these contracts with or without cause could have a material adverse impact on the predictability of our expected revenue stream 
many of our client contracts may be terminated by our clients without cause and do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
any failure to meet a client s expectations could result in a cancellation or non renewal of a contract or a decrease in business provided to us 
we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us  which would reduce our revenues 
oak hill capital partners and its affiliates  vikram talwar  rohit kapoor and certain other members of management exercise significant influence over us  and their interests in our business may be different than yours 
a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock are currently beneficially owned by oak hill capital partners lp and certain of its affiliates  our vice chairman and chief executive officer  vikram talwar  our president and chief operating officer  rohit kapoor  and certain other members of management 
as of december   oak hill capital partners lp and certain of its affiliates beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  mr 
talwar and certain trusts for his benefit and that of his family collectively beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  mr 
kapoor and certain trusts for his benefit and that of his family collectively beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  and certain other members of our management beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  each of these parties can exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs and all matters requiring a stockholders vote  including the composition of our board of directors  the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders may conflict with your interests 
we may not succeed in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or integrating an acquired business into our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
one of our strategies is to broaden our geographic presence  gain new clients  enter new streams of services and expand capacity both organically and through strategic acquisitions 
we may not  however  succeed in identifying suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices  have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions or be able to consummate any acquisition 
our management may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or maintain our standards  controls and policies  and any acquisition we do complete may not result in long term benefits to us 
acquisitions involve a 
table of contents number of risks  including diversion of management s attention  ability to finance the acquisition on attractive terms  failure to retain key personnel  legal liabilities and the need to amortize acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
future acquisitions may also result in the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities 
we may choose to expand operations to additional countries and may not be successful in maintaining our current profit margins in our new locations due to factors beyond our control 
we expect our new operations facility in the philippines to become operational in april in addition  we are also looking at additional locations other than india and the philippines to invest in an operations facility 
we cannot predict the extent of government support  availability of qualified workers  or monetary and economic conditions in other countries 
although some of these factors will influence our decision to establish operations in another country  there are inherent risks beyond our control  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political uncertainties  foreign exchange restrictions and foreign regulatory restrictions 
one or more of these factors or other factors relating to expanded international operations could result in increased operating expenses and make it more difficult for us to manage our costs and operations  which could harm our business and negatively impact our operating results 
we may increase the range of services that we provide to our clients and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate 
we are exploring opportunities to provide outsourced services that we have not provided to date 
should we decide to expand our service offerings  our results of operations may be negatively affected during any transition or growth period before such offerings achieve profitability 
for example  we may need to expand our training of our existing employees or recruit new  specially trained employees to provide these services  which could increase our costs of revenues disproportionately to the revenues generated by such services 
other challenges we may face include attracting and retaining clients for such services  integrating any new services into our current suite of services and managing any resulting growth in our operations 
failure to adhere to the regulations that govern our business could have an adverse impact on our operations 
our clients are often subject to regulations that may require that we comply with certain rules and regulations in performing services for them that would not otherwise apply to us 
debt collection services  for example  may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act  which regulates debt collection practices 
in addition  many us states require a debt collector to apply for  be granted and maintain a license to engage in debt collection activities in a state 
we are currently licensed or exempt from licensing requirements to provide debt collection services in all but two us states that have non exempt requirements and have separate per customer exemptions with respect to our ongoing collection obligations 
other federal laws and regulations that apply to certain portions of our business include the fair credit reporting act  the gramm leach bliley act  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  the truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act and the fdic rules and regulations 
if we do not maintain our licenses or other qualifications to provide our services  we may not be able to provide services to existing customers or be able to attract new clients and could lose revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil fines and criminal penalties 
we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company subject to the sarbanes oxley act of  and may be unable to maintain effective controls in light of our rapid growth  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a public company  we incur significant additional legal  accounting and other expenses 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission  
table of contents or the sec  and the nasdaq stock market  have required more regulation and more corporate governance practices of public companies 
we expect that our legal and financial compliance costs will continue to increase and that a significant portion of management s time will be diverted to comply with these rules 
we also expect that the need to comply with these rules and regulations will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
our rapid growth places significant demands on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage our growth effectively  we must implement and improve operational systems  procedures and internal controls on a timely basis 
for example  we are continuously reviewing and developing new policies regarding internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
during  we evaluated and tested our internal controls systems in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we observed specific instances in the first three quarters of  some of which were one time events  where our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 
if we do not manage to continually maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or do not implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or prevent fraud and might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec 
any such action could harm our business or investors confidence in us  and could cause our stock price to fall 
in addition  if we fail to implement these systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis  we may not be able to service our client needs  hire and retain new employees  pursue new business  complete future acquisitions or operate our business effectively 
risks related to the international nature of our business our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry  or if the same are not available for other reasons 
under the indian finance act   we currently benefit from a holiday from indian corporate income taxes 
as a result  our service operations have been subject to relatively lower tax liabilities 
we incurred minimal income tax expense in as a result of the tax holiday  compared to approximately million that we would have incurred if the tax holiday had not been available for that period without accounting for double taxation treaty set offs 
the indian finance act  phases out the tax holiday over a ten year period from fiscal through fiscal our current tax holidays expire in when our tax holiday expires or terminates  our tax expense will materially increase 
in may  the government of india adopted the indian finance act   that imposed a minimum alternative tax  or mat  on indian companies that benefit from a tax holiday with effect from april  any mat paid by us can be used as a credit against corporate income taxes payable by us after expiry of the tax holiday for up to seven years  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in addition  in may  the government of india implemented a fringe benefit tax on the exercise or vesting of equity instruments on or after april  the fringe benefit tax is payable by the employer on the exercise of options at the rate of on the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price of such options on the date of vesting of such options 
the fringe benefit tax is also payable on the vesting of full value awards such as restricted stock at the rate of on the fair market value of such awards 
the legislation permits the employer to recover the fringe benefit tax from the employees and we seek to recover the fringe benefit tax from those of our employees on whose behalf such tax is payable by us 
if we are unsuccessful in recovering the fringe benefit tax from our employees  we may experience a material adverse effect on our cash flows 

table of contents we currently benefit from a four year income tax holiday in the philippines that is extendable for an additional two years 
our current income tax holidays are expected to expire in the middle of  unless extended 
while we fully intend to apply for extensions of these holidays  it is possible that such extensions could be denied  or that due to changes in the government of the philippines that these holidays could be removed entirely 
should either of these events occur  our philippine tax liability could increase 
we may be required to pay additional taxes in connection with audits by the indian taxing authorities 
indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving related corporations be at an arms length price 
transactions among our subsidiaries and us may be considered such transactions 
the indian tax authorities have issued assessment orders against our subsidiaries exlservice 
com  inc  which we refer to as exl inc  and exl india 
two assessments issued with respect to exl inc 
and exl india allege that transfer pricing applied to transactions between such entities was not appropriate and demand the payment of additional taxes based on the disallowance of certain tax deductions taken by exl india 
three assessments issued with respect to exl inc allege that it has a permanent establishment in india and demands the payment of certain additional taxes based on such allegation 
the details of the assessment orders are as below entity tax year issue amount demanded amount deposited exl india the assessment order alleges that the transfer price we applied to transactions between exl india and exl inc in the tax year was not appropriate and disallows certain expenses claimed as tax deductible by exl india

million we are contesting all of these assessments and have filed appeals with the appropriate indian tax authorities 
based on advice from our indian tax advisors  the facts underlying our position and our experience with these types of assessments  we believe that the probability of loss is remote and have not accrued any amount with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements 
any amount paid by us as deposits will be refunded to us with interest if we succeed in our appeals 
we cannot assure you that our appeals will be successful or that these appeals will be finally resolved in the near future 
there is a likelihood that we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to the assessment orders received by us and that we might receive similar orders for subsequent years until these disputes are resolved 
future claims may be based on the transfer pricing or permanent establishment claims alleged by the indian tax authorities  or may be based on alternative arguments 
any failure of our appeals or further assessments would reduce our profitability and cash flows 
a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india  and we are subject to regulatory  economic and political uncertainties in india 
our principal operating subsidiaries are incorporated in india  and virtually all of our assets and our professionals are located in india 
we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india 
in the early s  india experienced significant inflation  low growth in gross domestic product and shortages of 
table of contents foreign currency reserves 
the indian government  however  has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy 
india s government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy  including the bpo industry 
certain of those programs  which have benefited us  include tax holidays  liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 
we cannot assure you that liberalization policies will continue 
in addition  the government of india is considering introducing a reservation policy to the private sector in india  pursuant to which all private sector companies operating in india  including our subsidiaries  would be required to reserve a certain percentage of jobs for the economically underprivileged population in the states where such companies are incorporated 
if this policy is adopted  our ability to hire employees of our choice may be affected due to restrictions on our pool of potential employees and competition for these professionals 
furthermore  the rate of economic liberalization could change  and specific laws and policies affecting technology companies  foreign investment  currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investment in our securities could also change 
since  the government of india has changed six times 
the current indian government is a coalition of many parties  some of which are communist and other far left parties in india  some of which do not want to continue india s current economic policies 
various factors  including a collapse of the present coalition government due to the withdrawal of support of coalition members  could trigger significant changes in india s economic liberalization and deregulation policies  disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular 
our financial performance and the trading price of our shares may be adversely affected by changes in inflation  exchange rates and controls  interest rates  government of india policies including taxation policies  social stability or other political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future 
the philippines periodically experiences political or economic instability  which could disrupt our operations  increase our costs and harm our business 
the philippines continues to experience low growth in its gross domestic product  significant inflation and shortages of foreign exchange 
we are exposed to the risk of rental and other cost increases due to inflation in the philippines  which has historically been at a much higher rate than in the united states 
these conditions could create political or economic instability that could harm businesses operating in the philippines 
in addition  the philippines has and may continue to experience political instability  including strikes  demonstrations  protests  marches  coups d tat  guerilla activity or other types of civil disorder 
these instabilities and any adverse changes in the political environment in the philippines could increase our operational costs  increase our exposure to legal and business risks and make it more difficult for us to operate our business in the philippines 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence involving india  the philippines  the united states or other countries could adversely affect the financial markets  result in a loss of client confidence and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  including those involving india  the philippines  the united states or other countries  may adversely affect worldwide financial markets and could potentially lead to economic recession  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
south asia has  from time to time  experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries  including india  pakistan and china 
in recent years there have been several instances of military confrontations along the indo pakistan border 
there continues to be potential for hostilities between india and pakistan due to recent terrorist activities and the geopolitical climate along the border 
although this has not been the case to date  such political tensions could create a perception that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by india based companies  which could have a material adverse effect on the market for our services 
furthermore  if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities  particularly hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear weapons  we might not be able to continue to operate 

table of contents an outbreak of an infectious disease or any other serious public health concerns in asia or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the outbreak of an infectious disease in asia or elsewhere or any other serious public health concerns could have a negative impact on the economies  financial markets and business activities in the countries in which our end markets are located  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the outbreak in of severe acute respiratory syndrome in asia and the outbreak of avian influenza  or bird flu  across asia and europe  including recent outbreaks in parts of india  have adversely affected a number of countries and companies 
although we have not been adversely impacted by these recent outbreaks  we can give no assurance that a future outbreak of an infectious disease among humans or animals or any other serious public health concerns will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are vulnerable to natural disasters that could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our business  results of operation and financial condition 
india is susceptible to natural disasters  including typhoons  tsunamis  floods and earthquakes 
the philippines is additionally susceptible to volcanic eruptions 
substantially all of our facilities and employees are located in india 
if our facilities are damaged by a typhoon  tsunami  flood  earthquake  volcanic eruption or other natural disaster  our operations and our ability to provide services to our clients could be interrupted or delayed significantly 
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses 
in addition  although all of our operations centers have access to other power sources  disaster management facilities in india may not be adequate to protect against potential losses 
in addition  clients may terminate their contracts with us if we cannot resume providing services quickly enough 
as a result  a natural disaster in india or the philippines could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
restrictions on entry visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states  which could have a material adverse effect on future revenues 
the vast majority of our employees are indian nationals 
the ability of some of our executives and employees to work with and meet our us and european clients and our clients from other countries depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and entry permits 
in response to terrorist attacks and global unrest  us and european immigration authorities have increased the level of scrutiny in granting visas 
immigration laws in those countries may also require us to meet certain levels of compensation and comply with other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas 
these restrictions have significantly lengthened the time requirements to obtain visas for our personnel  which has in the past resulted  and may continue to result  in delays in the ability of our personnel to meet with our clients 
in addition  immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces  economic conditions or other events  including terrorist attacks 
we cannot predict the political or economic events that could affect immigration laws or any restrictive impact those events could have on obtaining or monitoring entry visas for our professionals 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary visas for personnel who need to get to our clients sites  or if such visas are delayed  we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide these services on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
currency fluctuations among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  philippine peso and the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in uk pounds sterling in or us dollars in  most of our expenses in are incurred and paid in indian rupees 
we report our financial results in us dollars 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
the average indian rupee us dollar exchange rate in was approximately based on the 
table of contents noon buying rate in the city of new york for cable transfers as certified for customs purposes by the federal reserve bank of new york  representing appreciation of compared to the average exchange rate in the average indian rupee uk pound sterling exchange rate in was approximately based on the bloomberg composite rate  representing depreciation of compared to the average exchange rate in the average us us pound sterling exchange rate in was approximately based on the noon buying rate in the city of new york for cable transfers as certified for customs purposes by the federal reserve bank of new york representing depreciation of compared to the average exchange rate in although we take steps to hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar foreign currency exposures  our results of operations may be adversely affected if the indian rupee fluctuates significantly against the uk pound sterling or the uk dollar  the uk pound sterling depreciates against the uk dollar or our hedging strategy is unsuccessful 
if more stringent labor laws or other industry standards in india become applicable to us  our profitability may be adversely affected 
india has stringent labor legislation that protects the interests of workers  including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment 
in addition  we are subject to certain industry standards regarding our employees  particularly with regard to overtime and transportation of employees 
our employees may also in the future form unions 
if these labor laws or industry standards become more stringent or are more strictly enforced  or if our employees unionize  it may become difficult for us to maintain flexible human resource policies  discharge employees or downsize  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
investors may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the united states against our subsidiaries in india or our executive officers 
our primary operating subsidiaries are organized in india and a number of our executive officers reside outside of the united states 
most of our assets are located in india 
as a result  you may be unable to effect service of process upon our affiliates who reside in india outside their jurisdiction of residence 
in addition  you may be unable to enforce against these persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence judgments obtained in courts of the united states  including judgments predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the united states 
section a and section of the indian civil procedure code   or the civil code  govern recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments 
section a of the civil code provides for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment without having to file an original suit in india  provided such judgments have been rendered by courts in a country or territory outside india which the government of india has declared to be a reciprocating territory 
we have been advised by our indian counsel that the united states and india do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments other than certain arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not it is predicated upon the federal securities laws of the united states  would not be enforceable in india as such 
however  if the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in india based on a final judgment that has been obtained in the united states  section of the civil code provides that the foreign judgment will be conclusive as to certain matters 
the suit must be brought in india within three years of the date of the foreign judgment 
it is unlikely  however  that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a court in the united states if an action is brought in india 
it is also unlikely that an indian court would enforce judgments obtained in the united states if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or inconsistent with indian practice 

table of contents in addition  the party seeking to enforce in india a judgment obtained in the united states would also be required to obtain approval from the reserve bank of india under the foreign exchange management act  to execute such a judgment or to repatriate any money recovered in an indian court

see forward looking statements 
overview we are a recognized business solutions provider focused on providing a competitive edge to our clients by outsourcing and transforming their business processes 
our outsourcing services provide integrated front  middle and back office process outsourcing services for our us based and uk based clients 
outsourcing services involve the transfer to us of select business operations of a client  such as claims processing  finance and accounting and customer service  after which we administer and manage the operations for our client on an ongoing basis 
we also offer a suite of transformation service offerings that include research and analytics services  risk advisory services and process advisory services 
these transformation services offerings help our clients improve their operating environments through cost reduction initiatives  enhanced efficiency and productivity  and improving the risk and control environment within our clients operations whether or not they are outsourced to us 
a significant portion of our business relates to processes that we believe are integral to our clients operations  and the close nature of our relationships with our clients assists us in developing strong strategic long term relationships with them 
we serve primarily the needs of global companies in the insurance  banking  financial services  utilities  healthcare  telecommunications and transportation sectors 
we market our services directly through our sales and marketing and strategic account management teams  which operate out of new york and london  and our business development team  which operates out of noida  india 
we currently operate nine operations centers in india and one operation facility in us in addition  we are presently in the process of establishing a new operations facility in the philippines which will become operational in april we completed the inductis acquisition on july  the inductis acquisition has expanded the types and sophistication of the research and analytics services we offer 
the results of operations of inductis are consolidated in our financial statements with effect from july  as a result  our results of operations for the year ended december  are not comparable to our results of operations for the years ended december  and december  on october   we consummated an initial public offering of our shares of common stock 
our initial public offering resulted in net proceeds of million to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol exls 
in connection with the initial public offering  we effected a conversion of our common stock and a two for one stock split 
revenues we generate revenues principally from contracts to provide bpo  research and analytics or advisory services 
in  we had total revenues of million compared to total revenues of million in  an increase of 
the key drivers of growth in our total revenues in were as follows growth of our client base  both organically and inorganically  ongoing growth in existing client relationships  and addition of new services in the advisory services business 
we anticipate that our revenues will grow as we expand our service offerings  both organically and through further acquisitions 
revenues from new clients are an indicator of successful marketing efforts and do not represent a trend in our results of operations 
we provide our clients with a range of bpo services  including insurance services  banking and financial services  utilities  finance and accounting services and collection 
table of contents services 
our clients transfer the management and execution of their processes or business functions to us 
as part of this transfer  we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant bpo service  implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to that client or directly to that client s customers 
each client contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement 
the bpo services we provide to our clients particularly under our general framework agreements  and the revenues and income that we derive from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts change over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
for bpo services  we enter into long term agreements with our clients with initial terms ranging from three to five years 
although these agreements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our bpo services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
revenues under new client contracts also vary depending on when we complete the selling cycle and the implementation phase 
our research and analytics services are intended to facilitate more effective data based strategic and operating decisions by our clients using research  statistical and quantitative analytical techniques 
we materially expanded our research and analytics capabilities and enhanced the strategic dimension of our services with the inductis acquisition 
our advisory services include risk assessment  documentation and internal controls testing and business process re engineering and process quality monitoring 
our research and analytics services and our advisory services are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
in addition  our research and analytics services and our advisory services usually consist of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
we serve clients mainly in the united states and the united kingdom  with these two regions generating approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in the years ended december  and  our total revenues from our two largest clients grew to million and million  respectively  accounting for and of our total revenues  respectively  during these periods 
we provide services to norwich union  which represented million  or  of our total revenues in the year ended december  and million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december   under two framework agreements and work orders generated by these agreements 
the first framework agreement and all work orders under that agreement cannot be terminated without cause by our client at any time prior to may the second framework agreement expires in july and can be terminated by norwich union without cause upon six months prior notice and payment to us of a break up fee during its initial term 
after the initial term of the second framework agreement  norwich union may terminate this agreement without cause or penalty with six months notice 
we provide services to centrica  which represented million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december   under an agreement that has an initial term that expires in january and that can be terminated by centrica for cause only during its initial term 
contracts with other bpo clients representing approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  will expire prior to december   while the remainder of our bpo contracts expire in more than one year or do not have specified initial terms and remain in effect until terminated or until there are no work orders or engagement schedules 

table of contents we derived revenues from thirty eight and fifteen new clients for our services  including advisory and research and analytics services  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  by acquiring inductis  we obtained seventeen additional new clients in although we are increasing and diversifying our customer base  we expect in the near future that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients 
we recognize revenues from services provided under our client contracts on a cost plus  time and materials  fixed price  contingent fee or unit price basis 
under cost plus arrangements  we apply a mark up based on the service levels we achieve to the contractually agreed direct and apportioned indirect costs we incur and invoice the client for the marked up cost 
time and materials arrangements typically involve billings based on productive minutes or hours as we perform the related services 
unit price arrangements involve billings based on productive units such as the number of e mail responses as we deliver the services to the client 
revenues also include amounts representing reimbursable expenses that are billed to and reimbursed by our clients and typically include telecommunication and travel related costs 
the amount of reimbursable expenses that we incur  and any resulting revenues  can vary significantly from period to period depending on each client s situation and on the type of services provided 
for the years ended december  and december   and  respectively  of our revenues represent reimbursement of such expenses 
to the extent our client contracts do not contain provisions to the contrary  we bear the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to our contracts 
we hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar and rupee us pound rupee us dollar foreign currency exposure 
norwich union has the option transfer option from may through february under one of its contracts with us to purchase the shares of our subsidiary that operates one of our facilities in pune  india  by paying us an amount that will approximate the net asset value of that facility on the date of transfer 
on february   the company entered into a letter agreement  with norwich union  amending the terms of exercise of the transfer option 
pursuant to the letter agreement  the earliest date of exercise of the transfer option has been extended from january  to april  as a result  if the transfer option is exercised  the earliest date by which the company would be required to transfer the pune  india  facility to norwich union  is may  the remaining terms of our agreements with norwich union remain unchanged 
the exercise of this option would result in both a loss of revenues and the loss of all of our employees who are at that time working under that contract 
the affected facility generated and of our total revenues in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we expect that any decline in revenues that we would experience when norwich union exercises this option would be partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the operation of the affected pune facility 
norwich union has exercised its option to assume the operations of the facilities of two of its third party vendor contractors and has publicly announced its intention to undertake a strategic review of its indian operations  which could result in norwich union electing to modify or terminate its relationship with us 
expenses cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of employee costs  which include salary  retention and other compensation expenses  recruitment and training costs  non cash amortization of stock compensation expense  and traveling and lodging costs  and costs relating to our facilities and communications network  which include telecommunication and it costs  facilities and customer management support  operational expenses for our outsourcing centers  and rent expenses 

table of contents the most significant component of our cost of revenues is employee compensation  recruitment  training and retention 
salary levels in india  employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues 
salary increases are generally awarded each year effective april accordingly  employee costs are generally lower in the first quarter of each year compared to the rest of the year 
we make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements 
although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated  a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees in india  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute bpo services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes a non cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients 
we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in india and the united states to service additional business  in particular as our research and analytics and advisory services businesses grow and as wages continue to increase in india 
in particular  we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients 
cost of revenues is also affected by our long selling cycle and implementation period for our bpo services  which require significant commitments of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
in addition  once a client engages us in a new contract  our cost of revenues may represent a higher percentage of revenues until the implementation phase for that contract  generally three to four months  is completed 
we also expect cost of revenues to increase when we add new operations facilities due to increases in telecommunication and rent expenses and other facilities operating costs 
in particular  we are in the process of establishing a new workstation operation facility in pasay city  philippines  which will become operational in april as we increase the amount of physical infrastructure available to perform our operations  we expect that utilization will decrease and this will have a negative impact on our operating margin 
the india finance act  has imposed additional taxes on leased real estate 
as such  we may determine that it is in our interest to exercise our purchase options with respect to certain of our leased properties 
in addition  in the future we may decide to purchase real estate instead of leasing it  which is likely to increase our initial cash outflow in connection with any expansion of our facilities 
sg a expenses our general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries of senior management and other support personnel  legal and other professional fees  telecommunications  utilities and other miscellaneous administrative costs 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries of sales and marketing and strategic account management personnel  client relationship management  travel and brand building 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest heavily in our front end sales and strategic account management functions to better serve our clients 
we also expect our costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our back end support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development  performance management and training programs 
sg a expenses also include non cash amortization of stock compensation expense related to our issuance of equity awards to senior management  members of our board of directors and advisory board  other support personnel and consultants 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation and amortization of our tangible assets  including network equipment  cabling  computers  office furniture and equipment  motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets acquired in the inductis acquisition is part of depreciation and amortization 
as we add facilities  including our new workstation facility in pasay city  philippines  which will become operational in april  we expect that depreciation expense will increase  reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers  servers and other infrastructure 
foreign exchange exchange rates we report our financial results in us dollars and a substantial portion of our total revenues is earned in uk pounds sterling 
accordingly  our results of operations are adversely affected if the uk pound sterling depreciates against the uk dollar 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars or uk pounds sterling and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to and  respectively for the year ended december   most of our expenses in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  were incurred and paid in indian rupees 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling and the uk dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate in the future 
the results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the indian rupee appreciates or depreciates against the us dollar or the us pound sterling 
currency regulation according to the prevailing foreign exchange regulations in india  an exporter of bpo services which is registered with a software technology park or an export processing zone in india  such as our subsidiaries exl india and inductis india  is required to realize its export proceeds within a period of months from the date of exports 
similarly  in the event that such exporter has received any advance against exports in foreign exchange from its overseas customers  it will have to render the requisite services so that the advances so received are earned within a period of months 
if exl india or inductis india did not meet these conditions  it would be required to obtain permission to export foreign currency from the reserve bank of india 
exlservice holdings and inductis receive payments under most of our client contracts and are invoiced by exl india and inductis india  as applicable  in respect of services that exl india and inductis india  as applicable  provide to our clients under these contracts 
exl india and inductis india hold the foreign currency they receive  primarily from exlservice holdings and inductis  in an export earners foreign currency account 
all foreign exchange requirements  including import of capital goods  expenses incurred during foreign traveling of employees and discharge of foreign exchange can be met using the foreign currency in that account 
as and when funds are required in india  such funds are transferred to an ordinary indian rupee account 
income taxes the india finance act  provides exl india  noida customer operations private limited  which we refer to as ncop  and inductis india with a ten year holiday from indian corporate income taxes as an entity exporting it services from designated software technology parks and export processing zones in india 
the india finance act  phases out the tax holiday over a ten year period from fiscal through fiscal accordingly  facilities established in india on or before march  have a ten year tax holiday  new facilities established on or before march  have a nine year tax holiday and so forth until march  after march   the tax holiday will no longer be available to new facilities 
exl india and ncop provides bpo services from its wholly owned  export oriented units situated in noida and pune 
the income derived from the services rendered from these facilities is not subject to taxes in india until march  inductis india is located in gurgaon and its services also qualify under the india finance act  for a tax holiday until march  
table of contents as a result of the tax holiday  our bpo service operations have been subject to relatively lower tax liabilities 
for example  we recognized lower income tax expense with respect to the company s foreign operations for the year ended december  as a result of the tax holiday  compared to approximately million that we would have incurred if the tax holiday had not been available for that period without accounting for double taxation treaty set offs 
when our tax holiday expires or terminates  our tax expense will materially increase 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
in may  the government of india adopted the indian finance act   that imposed a minimum alternative tax  or mat  on indian companies that benefit from a tax holiday with effect from april  any mat paid by us can be used as a credit against corporate income taxes payable by us after expiry of the tax holiday for up to seven years  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes a deferred tax asset of  has been recognized as of december  exlservice philippines  inc  exl philippines  our subsidiary that conducts our operations in the philippines will enjoy a four year income tax holiday incentive extendable up to six years beginning april  which is the estimated date of commencement of operations 
the above incentive is subject to validation by the philippines economic zone authority based on certain minimum investments 
if exl philippines does not attain the required investments it will not qualify for the income tax holiday and will be subject to a gross income tax 

table of contents us and indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an arm s length price 
transactions among our subsidiaries and us may be considered such transactions 
accordingly  we determine the pricing among our associated enterprises on the basis of detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control 
based on the analysis  we had made certain changes to our transfer pricing agreements with effect from april if the applicable income tax authorities review any of our tax returns and determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate  we may incur increased tax liabilities  including accrued interest and penalties 
we are currently involved in disputes with indian tax authorities over the application of some of our transfer pricing policies 
we have received five assessment orders from the indian tax authorities with respect to their audit of certain of our subsidiaries 
the indian tax authorities are examining income tax returns for other tax years 
the details of assessment orders are as below entity tax year issue amount demanded amount deposited exl india the assessment order alleges that the transfer price we applied to transactions between exl india and exl inc in the tax year was not appropriate and disallows certain expenses claimed as tax deductible by exl india 
million million exl india the assessment order alleges that the transfer price we applied to transactions between exl india and exl inc for the tax year was not appropriate and disallows certain expenses claimed as tax deductible by exl india 
million million exl inc the assessment order alleges that exl inc has a permanent establishment in india 
million million exl inc the assessment order alleges that exl inc has a permanent establishment in india 
million exl inc the assessment order alleges that exl inc has a permanent establishment in india 
million based on advice from our indian tax advisors  the facts underlying our position and our experience with these types of assessments  we believe that the probability of loss is remote and have accordingly not accrued any amount with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect any impact from these assessments on our future income tax expense 
we are subject to us income taxes on the profits we recognize in the united states 
there is a likelihood that we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to the assessment orders received by us and that we might receive similar orders for other years until those disputes are resolved 
inductis acquisition on july   we completed the inductis acquisition 
inductis is a provider of research and analytics services 
the inductis acquisition has expanded the types and sophistication of the research and analytics services we offer 
we paid approximately million on the closing date in the form of million in cash including amounts paid for working capital adjustments  the issuance of  shares of our common stock after withholding in respect of taxes and million in transaction costs  and paid a million bonus in january we also assumed million of inductis debt  which we repaid in full on september  for the period ended december   inductis profit adjusted earnout revenue which amount is defined in the inductis acquisition agreement to equal either its revenue or a lower amount if certain profit margin targets are not achieved as set forth in the inductis acquisition agreement was equal to million dollars 
as a result  per the terms of the inductis acquisition agreement  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock 
table of contents worth approximately million to the former holders of inductis common stock in satisfaction of some of our earnout payment obligations under that agreement and  shares of restricted stock previously granted to the former holders of inductis common stock have been earned based on the achievement of certain performance based criteria and will vest over a three year period 
there are no further payments due to inductis based on inductis profit adjusted earnout revenue 
critical accounting policies we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements  as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies include revenue recognition  estimating tax liabilities  stock based compensation  derivative instruments and pension plan liabilities 
these accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below 
future events may not develop exactly as forecast  and estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from bpo  research and analytics and advisory services provided on a cost plus  time and materials  fixed price  contingent fee or unit priced basis 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  there are no remaining obligations with respect to the services rendered and collection is considered probable 
we invoice clients in accordance with agreed rates and billing arrangements 
we recognize revenues from the last billing date to the balance sheet date as unbilled revenues  and we recognize billings in excess of revenues earned or advances received from clients as deferred revenue 
under cost plus arrangements  we apply a mark up based on the service levels we achieve to the contractually agreed direct and apportioned indirect costs we incur and invoice the client for the marked up cost 
time and materials arrangements typically involve billings based on productive time as we perform the related services 
unit price arrangements involve billings based on productive units as we deliver the services to the client 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax estimates include decisions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation of our tax position  we believe we have adequately accrued for probable exposures as of december  to the extent we are able to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
at december   we performed an analysis of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance on our indian subsidiaries and concluded that a valuation allowance offsetting certain deferred tax assets be recorded  on the basis that it is more likely than not that there will not be future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
we perform this assessment at the end of each reporting period 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  
table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method of transition with regard to stock based awards 
before the consummation of our initial public offering  we used a third party valuation firm to perform valuations of the fair value of our securities in connection with certain stock based equity grants 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based payments using apb under apb  compensation expense was generally not recognized when both the exercise price is the same as the market price and the number of shares to be issued is set on the date the employee stock option is granted 
we chose to use the intrinsic value method to measure our compensation costs 
if we had used the fair value method  we would have recognized additional compensation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  significant factors considered in determining the fair value of stock awards are as follows 
the company estimates the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
in the absence of a history of volatility of our stock trading  we have used the volatility of stocks of comparative companies with estimated life of options similar to ours 
the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model is based on us treasury zero coupon bonds with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under our policies  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the uk pound sterling and the indian rupee 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of mitigating the underlying exposure from foreign currency fluctuation risks associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with the changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and not for speculative trading purposes 
we also hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign exchange contracts that are designated effective and qualify as cash flow hedges  under sfas no 
changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges which are deemed effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the contract is settled and at that time are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
we evaluate hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis 
if during this time  a contract is deemed ineffective  the change in the fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   forward exchange contracts of million and uk pounds sterling million were outstanding 
we have evaluated the effectiveness of all our forward exchange contracts 
for the year ended december  and  net gains losses from ineffective cash flow hedges included in our consolidated statements of income totaled million and million  respectively 
for hedge contracts discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period  any related derivative amounts recorded in accumulated comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings 
pension plan liability we provide our employees in india with benefits under a defined benefit plan  which we refer to as the gratuity plan 
the gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement or on 
table of contents termination of employment in an amount based on the respective employee s salary and years of employment with us 
we determine our liability under the gratuity plan by actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method 
under this method  we determine our liability based upon the discounted value of salary increases until the date of separation arising from retirement  death  resignation or other termination of services 
critical assumptions used in measuring the plan expense and projected liability under the projected unit credit method include the discount rate  expected return on assets and the expected increase in the compensation rates 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
we periodically evaluate and update other assumptions used in the projected unit credit method involving demographic factors  such as retirement age and turnover rate  to reflect our experience 
the future mortality rates used are consistent with those published by the life insurance corporation of india 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate we use is equal to the yield on high quality fixed income investments in india at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and therefore increases gratuity expense 
since our gratuity plan is unfunded  we have not assumed any returns on assets

as we add facilities  we expect that depreciation expense will increase  reflecting the additional investment in equipment and facilities necessary to meet customer requirements 
income from operations 
income from operations increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  income from operations increased due to a significant increase in revenue from bpo and advisory services attributable to higher than expected demand 
this was partly offset by a loss from operations of million at inductis due to lower demand caused primarily by lower discretionary spending among its largest customers

income from operations 
income from operations increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  operating margin increased period to period due to a significant increase in revenue from our advisory services partly caused by seasonal factors  a higher than expected increase in revenue growth  the inclusion of inductis in our revenues  favorable exchange rate  better capacity utilization rate  and a savings in employee costs due to the delayed hiring of professionals in support function in the period over the period 
as a percentage of revenues  income from operations increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in operating margin is also partially a result of a reduction in bonus of approximately million within our research and analytics business for select senior personnel in order to achieve specified targets required for payment of the earnout under the inductis acquisition agreement 
we believe that these reductions are non recurring in nature and had the bonus reductions not been made  million would have reduced our income from operations

accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities or sfas no 
 on july  see note  redeemable preferred stock  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased from a benefit of million for the year ended december  to an expense of million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily because of an increase in current taxes by million 
this was partly offset by the recognition of a deferred tax asset of million in compared to million in the primary reason for this change is a decrease in valuation allowance of million for the year ended december  see note  income taxes  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  dividends and accretion on preferred stock 
dividends and accretion on preferred stock was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting the reclassification of our preferred stock in august the preferred stock was classified as a liability until august  and was reflected as equity thereafter in the comparable prior period 
see note  redeemable preferred stock  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  net income to common stockholders 
net income to common stockholders increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net income margin increased period to period due to the increase in our revenue growth  favorable exchange rates and better capacity utilization 
the significant increase in net income to common stockholders does not represent a trend in our results of operations and will vary as we build capacity for future ramps ups and exchange rates change 
as a percentage of revenues  net income increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
in october  we consummated an initial public offering of our common stock 
in the offering  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at an initial offering price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million and related offering expenses of approximately million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to repurchase all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock and approximately million to repay all outstanding senior promissory notes payable to certain stockholders cash flows from operating activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  generally  factors that affect our earnings for example  pricing  volume of services  costs and productivity affect our cash flows provided by operations in a similar manner 
however  while management of working capital  including timing of collections and payments  affects operating results only indirectly  the impact on working capital and cash flows provided by operating activities can be significant 
the increase in cash flows from operations is predominantly due to the increase in net income adjusted for non cash items 
this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable  attributable to the growth of our business and payment of income tax liabilities 
net income adjusted for non cash items increased in the year ended december  by million compared to the year ended december  due to the continued growth in our business 

table of contents cash used in investing activities decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease is a result of the investments made in the year ended december  towards purchase consideration paid for the inductis acquisition  the purchase of fixed assets for our new facility in noida and the buy out of our facility in pune 
cash flows from financing activities decreased from an inflow of million in the year ended december  to an inflow of million in the year ended december   primarily due to proceeds from our initial public offering in october  offset by repayment of bank borrowings and long term debt in the year ended december   as compared to proceeds from exercises of stock options in the year ended december  we expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business 
as we have focused on expanding our cash flow from operating activities  we have made significant capital investments  primarily related to new facilities 
capital expenditures we make to meet client needs represent primarily leasehold improvements to build out facilities  telecommunications equipment  and computer hardware and software we purchase in connection with managing client operations 
we incurred million of capital expenditures in we expect to incur approximately million of capital expenditures in primarily to meet the growth requirements of our clients  including expanding our facilities in india and in the philippines  as well as to improve our internal technology 
the timing and volume of such capital expenditures in the future will be affected by new contracts we may enter into or the expansion of our existing contracts 
in addition  in connection with the tax assessment orders issued against exl india and exl inc we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to the assessment orders received by us and for similar orders for subsequent years that may be received by us 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from our october initial public offering for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities and remaining proceeds from our october initial public offering to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the remaining net proceeds from our october initial public offering will be sufficient to meet our ongoing capital expenditure  working capital and other cash needs over the next two years 
if we have significant growth through acquisitions or require additional operating facilities to service customer contracts  we may need to obtain additional financing 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in millions less than year years years after years total capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have entered into an insurance services framework agreement and related virtual shareholders agreement with norwich union pursuant to which we have granted norwich union the option from may 
table of contents through february to purchase the shares of our subsidiary that operates one of our facilities in pune  india  upon the payment of an amount that will approximate the net asset value of that facility on the date of transfer 
the exercise of this option would result in both a loss of revenues and the loss of all of our employees who are at that time working under that contract 
we expect that any decline in revenues that we would experience when norwich union exercises this option would be partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the operation of the pune facilities 
see risk factors risks related to our business our agreements with our largest client give it the option to assume the operations of one of our facilities  and the exercise of that option could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
norwich union has exercised its option to assume the operations of the facilities of two of its third party vendor contractors and has publicly announced its intention to undertake a strategic review of its indian operations  which could result in norwich union electing to modify or terminate its relationship with us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the loss of future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributable to all market sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables 
our exposure to market risk is a function of our expenses and revenue generating activities in foreign currencies 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to loss 
most of our exposure to market risk arises out of our foreign currency accounts receivable 
pursuant to our investment policy  our surplus funds are kept as cash or cash equivalents and are invested in highly rated commercial paper and money market accounts to reduce our exposure to market risk with regard to these funds 
risk management procedures we manage market risk through our treasury operations 
our senior management and our board of directors approve our treasury operation s objectives and policies 
the activities of our treasury operations include management of cash resources  implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures  borrowing strategies  if any  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies 
components of market risk exchange rate risk 
the functional currency of exlservice holdings  and our subsidiaries exl inc  inductis llc and inductis inc  is the us dollar 
the functional currency of exl india  ncop  inductis india and exl support services pvt 
ltd  which we refer to as esspl  is the indian rupee 
the functional currency of exl uk is the uk pound sterling 
the functional currency of inductis singapore pte limited is the singapore dollar 
the functional currency of exl philippines is the philippines peso 
in each case  the functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates 
monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing on the related balance sheet dates 
transactions in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction 
all transaction related foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the related balance sheet date 
revenues and 
table of contents expenses are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the last business day of each month  which approximates the average monthly exchange rate 
resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
our exposure to market risk arises principally from exchange rate risk 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars in the year ended december  or uk pounds sterling in the year ended december   most of our expenses in the year ended december  are incurred and paid in indian rupees 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  uk pound sterling and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues  expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency accounts receivable 
based upon our level of operations during the year ended december  and excluding any hedging arrangements that we had in place during that period  a appreciation depreciation in the uk pound sterling against the uk dollar would have increased decreased revenues in the year ended december  by approximately million 
similarly  a appreciation depreciation in the indian rupee against the us dollar would have increased decreased our expenses incurred and paid in indian rupees in the year ended december  by approximately million 
we have sought to reduce the effect of indian rupee and uk pound sterling gbp exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts to cover a substantial portion of cost incurred in our india operations 
forward exchange contracts with a notional amount of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  and of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  the forward foreign exchange contracts typically mature within twelve months  must be settled on the day of maturity and may be cancelled subject to the payment of any gains or losses in the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation 
we use these instruments as cash flow hedges and not for speculative purposes 
we may not purchase contracts adequate to insulate ourselves from indian rupee and uk pound sterling foreign exchange currency risks 
in addition  any such contracts may not perform adequately as a hedging mechanism 
we may  in the future  adopt more active hedging policies  and have done so in the past 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling million at december  these amounts were invested principally in a short term investment portfolio primarily comprised of investment grade commercial paper 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the interest income from these funds will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates would reduce future investment income 
a decrease in short term rates would reduce our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately million
