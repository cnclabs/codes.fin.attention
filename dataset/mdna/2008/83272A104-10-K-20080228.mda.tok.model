item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include the impact of the natural gas derivative instruments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk our principal foreign exchange exposure is the canadian dollar 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in canada 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the us dollar 
the canadian dollar has strengthened against the us dollar in each of the last three years 
in  and  the average exchange rates for the canadian dollar strengthened against the us dollar by  and  respectively 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are not hedged 
we use financial derivative instruments  including forward contracts and options  primarily to protect against canadian currency exchange risk associated with expected future cash flows 
these instruments typically have maturities of twelve months or less 
as of december   we had monthly canadian dollar forward purchase contracts to hedge approximately of our estimated requirements for we performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and that measures the change in the book value of our net monetary canadian liability arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant 
the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the canadian dollar exchange rate at december  and  would be million and million  respectively 
fluctuations in canadian dollar monetary assets and liabilities result in gains or losses  which are credited or charged to income 
interest rate risk our earnings and cash flow are significantly affected by the amount of interest on our indebtedness 
our financing arrangements include both fixed and variable rate debt in which changes in interest rates will impact the fixed and variable rate debt differently 
a change in the interest rate of fixed rate debt will impact the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rate on the variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows 
our objective is to mitigate interest rate volatility and reduce or cap interest expense within acceptable levels of market risk 
we periodically enter into interest rate swaps  caps or options to hedge interest rate exposure and manage risk within company policy 
any derivative would be specific to the debt instrument  contract or transaction  which would determine the specifics of the hedge 
we have entered into interest rate swap contracts effectively fixing the interest rate at for million of the tranche b and tranche c variable rate term loans 
these contracts extend until  consistent with the maturity on our tranche b and tranche c term loans 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the fluctuations in the variable interest rate  and are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction is recorded 
the accounting for the cash flow impact of the swap contracts is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense each period 
the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at december  was a million liability  included in other long term liabilities 
we performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and that measures the change in interest expense on our variable rate debt arising from a hypothetical basis point adverse movement in interest rates 
based on our outstanding variable rate debt as of december  and  a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
the table below presents principal amounts by year of anticipated maturity for our debt obligations and related average interest rates based on the weighted average interest rates at the end of the period 
variable interest rates disclosed do not attempt to project future interest rates and do not reflect the impact of our interest rate swap contracts
