item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company primarily franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
of the  restaurants in countries at year end   are operated by franchisees including  operated by developmental licensees   are operated by affiliates and  are operated by the company 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant businesses  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites 
this ensures long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide capital for the entire business  including the real estate interest  while the company generally has no capital invested 
we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix that is  our mix among company operated  franchised  conventional or developmental license  and affiliated to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability 
in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve both goals 
although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues  company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets 
in our company operated restaurants  and in collaboration with our franchisees  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide 
in addition  we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 
our company operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations 
revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates 
these fees primarily include rent and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales  with specified minimum rent payments  along with initial fees 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments 
significant reportable segments include the united states us  europe  and asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea 
in addition  throughout this report we present other countries corporate that includes operations in canada and latin america  as well as corporate activities and certain investments 
the us  europe and apmea segments account for  and of total revenues  respectively 
france  germany and the united kingdom uk  collectively  account for approximately of europe s revenues  and australia  china and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for over of apmea s revenues 
these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise over of total revenues 
the company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the mcdonald s restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for long term growth remain significant 
accordingly  during the third quarter  the company sold its investment in boston market 
in  the company disposed of its investment in chipotle mexican grill chipotle via public stock offerings and a tax free exchange for mcdonald s common stock 
as a result of the disposals during and  both boston market s and chipotle s results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth  systemwide sales growth  restaurant margins and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because we believe they better represent the underlying business trends 
comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction  reimaging or remodeling  rebuilding  and natural disasters 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays  weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales 
the company refers to this impact as the calendar shift trading day adjustment 
this impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales 
typically  the annual impact is minimal  with the exception of leap years 
systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants  whether operated by the company  by franchisees or by affiliates 
while sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because it is the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base 

table of contents return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator by the adjusted cash used for investing activities denominator  primarily capital expenditures 
the calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 
strategic direction and financial performance the unique business relationship among the company  its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald s success over the years 
this business model enables mcdonald s to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers 
in addition  it facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business worldwide 
since implementing the customer centered plan to win several years ago  our focus has been on being better  not just bigger 
our strategic alignment behind this plan has created better mcdonald s experiences through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences people  products  place  price and promotion 
while our focus has remained the same  we have adapted and evolved our initiatives based on the changing needs and preferences of our customers 
these multiple initiatives have increased our consumer relevance and contributed to sales and guest counts worldwide increasing every year since as a result  we have met or exceeded our long term financial targets  excluding the impact of the sale of latin american and caribbean markets to a developmental licensee 
these targets  which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation  include average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of to  average annual operating income growth of to  and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens 
we believe our financial targets are realistic and sustainable and enable our management to focus on those opportunities that best optimize long term shareholder value 
in  we built on our strong performance by focusing on what consumer insights indicate are key drivers of our global business today convenience  branded affordability  daypart expansion and menu choice 
leveraging our ability to replicate and scale success in these areas worldwide  we drove global comparable sales up and extended the number of consecutive monthly increases to through december in the us  our momentum continued as we further built on our market leading breakfast business  introduced new products such as the southwest salad  cinnamon melts and the mcskillet burrito  extended our snack wrap line and offered greater beverage choices including premium roast iced coffee and sweet tea 
these initiatives  along with longer operating hours and everyday value  resonated with consumers to drive increased customer visits and increased sales 
in addition  our efforts to strengthen employee engagement and optimize efficiency in the drive thru and at breakfast helped us to better serve even more customers 
in europe  we sustained strong sales growth in virtually every country 
primary contributors to this performance included france  germany  russia and the uk our success in europe was driven by continued execution along three key priorities upgrading the customer and employee experience  building brand transparency  and enhancing local relevance 
key initiatives included reimaging more than locations  actively communicating mcdonald s food quality  nutrition and employment facts and implementing a new kitchen operating system  which is now in over half of our european restaurants  to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety 
in addition  we satisfied consumer desire for choice and value with locally relevant menus that feature a blend of premium sandwiches and salads  classic menu favorites  new products  limited time food promotions as well as everyday value offerings 
in apmea  our business posted strong sales performance  driven by positive comparable sales in nearly every country  led by japan  australia and china 
in addition  restaurant expansion in china where we believe our growth potential is significant contributed to revenue and operating income growth 
throughout apmea  we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants offering hours or extended hours of service to approximately  we also continued to deliver value to customers through branded affordability platforms and offer menu choice and variety with locally relevant core menu extensions such as the teriyaki mac in japan and variations of the filet o fish in china 
in addition  we invigorated our breakfast business in apmea with the national launch of breakfast in china and the introduction of mcgriddles sandwiches in japan 
strong global performance generated billion of cash from operations in about billion of this cash was invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and build new ones 
for through  the company expects to return billion to billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  subject to business and market conditions 
in  we increased our annual dividend to per share more than six times higher than the amount paid in and repurchased over million shares for billion 
in  we took a number of steps to strengthen management s focus on the core mcdonald s business and those markets that have the largest impact on results 
we sold our investment in boston market in  receiving proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  the company retained about sites  the majority of which will be converted to mcdonald s restaurants 
we also made significant progress enhancing the mix of franchised and company operated restaurants  including executing our developmental license strategy  to maximize long term brand performance and returns 
under a developmental license  a local entrepreneur owns the business  including controlling the real estate  and uses his her capital and local knowledge to build the mcdonald s brand and optimize long term sales and profitability 
the company collects a royalty  which varies by market  based on a percent of sales  but does not invest any capital for new restaurants or reinvestments 
we have successfully used this structure for more than years and had it in place in countries at year end in august  we completed the transition of  restaurants in brazil  argentina  mexico  puerto rico  
table of contents venezuela and other countries in latin america and the caribbean to a developmental license structure 
the company refers to these markets as latam 
based on approval by the company s board of directors on april   the company concluded latam was held for sale as of that date in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of billion in  substantially all of which was noncash 
the charge included million for the difference between the net book value of the latam business and approximately million in cash proceeds received 
this loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction 
the charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of million recorded in shareholders equity 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million in connection with this transaction 
as a result of meeting the held for sale criteria  the company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to latam effective april  in connection with the sale  the company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims  certain of which are reflected as liabilities in mcdonald s consolidated balance sheet totaling million at year end the buyers of the company s operations in latam have entered into a year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers  among other obligations to i pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets  substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements  ii commit to adding approximately new mcdonald s restaurants over the first three years and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened  and iii commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants 
in addition  we transitioned another five small markets in europe with a total of restaurants to the developmental license structure in we also made progress franchising certain company operated restaurants in key markets 
as a result of our developmental license strategy and franchising initiatives  the percent of franchised and affiliated restaurants worldwide increased from at year end to at year end highlights from the year included comparable sales increased building on a increase in systemwide sales increased in constant currencies 
company operated margins reached an eight year high of 
franchised margins were a level not achieved in over ten years 
cash provided by operations totaled billion and capital expenditures totaled billion 
the company announced that for through  we expect to return billion to billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  subject to business and market conditions 
in  the company raised its annual dividend by to per share  or billion  and repurchased million shares for billion  driving a reduction of over of total shares outstanding at year end compared with one year roiic was and three year roiic was for outlook for the mcdonald s system is energized by our current worldwide momentum 
we intend to build on this momentum by continuing to execute our plan to win with its strategic focus on our customers and restaurants while exercising disciplined financial management 
as we do so  we are confident we will continue to meet or exceed the long term financial targets previously discussed 
we will continue to drive success in and beyond by leveraging key consumer insights and our global experience  while relying on our strengths in developing  testing and implementing initiatives surrounding our global business drivers of convenience  branded affordability  daypart expansion and menu variety 
in the us  our key areas of focus will be breakfast  chicken  beverages and convenience 
in  we expect to build on our breakfast momentum and at the same time extend our leadership in the chicken category with the launch of the southern style chicken biscuit sandwich for breakfast and the southern style chicken sandwich for the remainder of the day 
we will also continue to provide value and convenience to solidify our connection with consumer lifestyles 
in addition  as part of a comprehensive  multi year beverage business strategy designed to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category  we will begin introducing hot specialty coffee offerings in  on a market by market basis 
it will not be until late when we will begin to recognize the full sales benefit of our beverage opportunity 
this first component of our beverage business may require construction  new equipment  new processes and training in our restaurants  all of which will serve as a platform for the anticipated future introduction of smoothies  frappes and other beverage options 
in europe  we plan to strengthen our local relevance using a tiered menu approach featuring premium selections  classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings 
we will complement these with new products and limited time food promotions developed in our european food studio 
building greater brand transparency will remain a priority in europe  especially in the uk  with ongoing communication efforts highlighting the quality of our food and building our reputation as an employer of choice 
we will also create stronger bonds of trust by being accessible and maintaining an open dialogue with customers and key stakeholders 
as part of our efforts to upgrade the customer experience  we will continue remodeling additional restaurants in the uk and germany 
in germany  an integral part of our reimaging program includes adding about mccafes in we will also continue installing our new kitchen operating system to ensure that we can consistently deliver high food quality  with a goal for this new system to be in virtually all of our european restaurants by the end of in apmea  locally relevant execution of our strategies surrounding convenience  breakfast  core menu extensions and value is essential to sustaining momentum in this diverse and dynamic part of the world 
convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of hours or extended hours of service  offering delivery service in certain countries and building our drive thru business  particularly in china 
in addition  we will continue to emphasize breakfast to further build this daypart  communicate our everyday value offerings and feature limited time variations of classic menu favorites 

table of contents we believe locally owned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage and make us not just a global brand but a locally relevant one 
to that end  we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns 
we completed a detailed analysis of the appropriate ownership mix in key markets around the world taking into account our plans for each of those markets  the risks associated with operating in the market and restaurant level results 
this analysis also considered the current legal and regulatory environment which  in some countries such as china and russia  may make it prudent for the company to own and operate the restaurants 
based on this analysis  we expect to refranchise a total of  to  existing company operated restaurants  primarily in our major markets  over the next three or more years 
this will be dependent on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate several small markets in apmea and europe for potential transition to developmental license structures 
we will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the long term 
our evolution toward a more heavily franchised  less capital intensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest  the strength and stability of our cash flow and for our returns 
as a result  we expect free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures will continue to grow and be a significant source of cash used to fund our total cash returned to shareholders target for through of billion to billion 
in addition  we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in the share count in the years ahead 
while the company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share  the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add slightly more than percentage point to systemwide sales growth in constant currencies  most of which will be due to the net traditional restaurants added in the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure  a percentage point increase in us comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about cents 
similarly  an increase of percentage point in europe s comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about cents 
in  us beef costs are expected to be relatively flat and chicken costs are expected to rise about to 
in europe  beef costs are expected to be relatively flat in  while chicken costs are expected to increase approximately to 
some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business 
the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to decline  in constant currencies  although fluctuations may be experienced between the quarters due to items such as the biennial worldwide owner operator convention  the beijing summer olympics and the august sale of the company s businesses in latam 
based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates  the company expects interest expense in to increase approximately to compared with  while interest income is expected to be about half of interest income 
a significant part of the company s operating income is generated outside the us  and about of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro and the british pound 
if the euro and the british pound both move in the same direction compared with  the company s annual net income per share would change by about cents to cents 
the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately to  although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately billion 
about half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to open  restaurants traditional and satellites 
we expect net additions of about net traditional additions and net satellite closings 
for through  the company expects to return billion to billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  subject to business and market conditions 
in  the company returned billion of this goal to shareholders 
as a result of the new developmental licensee structure  the company s operating results in latin america will reflect royalty income of approximately of sales and minimal selling  general administrative expenses to support the business 
we continually review our restaurant ownership structures to maximize cash flow and returns and to enhance local relevance 
we expect to optimize our restaurant ownership mix by refranchising  to  company operated restaurants over the next three or more years  primarily in our major markets  and by continuing to execute our developmental license strategy

in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve these goals 
although direct restaurant operation is significantly more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues  company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets 
in our company operated restaurants  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide 
in addition  we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 
we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs 
we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe the following information about company operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business 
management responsible for our company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the company operated business on this basis to assess its performance 
management of the company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix  subject to other relevant considerations 
the following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our company operated margins 
the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations  which we refer to below as store operating margin 
the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties 
we refer to this component as brand real estate margin 
both company operated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties  although rent and royalties for company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation 
rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales  and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald s investment in the restaurant 
royalties may also vary by market 
as shown in the following tables  in disaggregating the components of our company operated margins  certain costs with respect to company operated restaurants are reflected in brand real estate margin 
those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses  and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brand real estate margin 
while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our company operated business  it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular  as noted above  we do not allocate selling  general administrative expenses to our company operated business 
an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the us and our three major markets in europe 
we believe  on average  that a range of  to  per restaurant is typical  but the actual costs will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market 
these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

fitch  standard poor s and moody s currently rate the company s commercial paper f  a and p  respectively  and its long term debt a  a and a  respectively 
historically  the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
the company s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table 
while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus  it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt 
total adjusted debt  a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above  includes debt outstanding on the company s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases 
based on their most recent calculations  these agencies add between billion and billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes  which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes 
the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments 
these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents  excluding certain company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately of company operated restaurant minimum rents outside the us  based on the company s estimate  capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense  and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites 
based on this calculation  for credit analysis purposes  approximately billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 
certain of the company s debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries 
there are no provisions in the company s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company s business 
the company has approximately billion of authority to issue debt securities  including debt securities registered on a us shelf registration statement and in connection with a euro medium term notes program

in  the company expects to issue commercial paper and long term debt in order to refinance maturing debt and finance a portion of the company s previously disclosed expectation to return billion to billion to shareholders 
debt maturing in includes approximately billion of outstanding borrowings under the hia multi currency term loan facility and million of long term corporate debt 
the company uses major capital markets  bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated 
derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and in miscellaneous other assets of million and million  respectively  and other long term liabilities of million and million  respectively 
see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no 
regarding derivatives 

table of contents the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties  intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity 
total foreign currency denominated debt  including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements  was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
in addition  where practical  the company s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements 
certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below  or aggregate exposures exceed  certain contractual limits 
at december  and  the company was required to post collateral of million and million  respectively  which was used to reduce the carrying value of the derivatives recorded in other long term liabilities 
the company s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of us dollars euro australian dollars canadian dollars british pounds sterling russian ruble the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both company operated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations 
in addition  the company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements 
cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make tax deferred contributions and ii receive company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of irs limitations 
the investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the company s qualified profit sharing and savings plan 
total liabilities for the supplemental plans were million at december  and million at december  and were included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
also included in other long term liabilities at december  were gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and liabilities for international retirement plans of million 
in connection with the latam transaction  the company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims  certain of which are reflected as liabilities in mcdonald s consolidated balance sheet totaling million at year end other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment  or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life  which significantly impact the assumed fair value 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
when the company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee  it determines when these businesses are held for sale in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and  if required  the company s board of directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets  the assets are available for disposal  the disposal is probable of occurring within months  and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets net book value  among other factors 
an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and the estimated cash sales price  less costs of disposal 
an alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees 
under this alternative for the latam transaction  approximately million of the billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of years  resulting in about million of expense annually 
this policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees 
the company bases its accounting policy on management s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements 
the company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market based fees in future periods  particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees 
therefore  the company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction 
litigation accruals from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies  including the sale of appreciated assets  in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
the numerator is the company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization  from the base period  adjusted for the impact of the latam developmental license transaction in while the company has previously converted certain other markets to a developmental license structure  management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction 
management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented 
the denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market  chipotle and latam transactions 
the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis 
these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income 
for example  fourth quarter investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations 
in contrast  fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than months ago  and therefore have a full year impact on operating income  with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations  respectively 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average
