item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion may contain forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward looking statements 
some factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward looking statements are described in item a risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the marketing and sale of marine  aviation and land fuel products and related services on a worldwide basis 
in our marine segment  we offer fuel and related services to a broad base of maritime customers  including international container and tanker fleets and time charter operators  as well as to the united states and foreign governments 
in our aviation segment  we offer fuel and related services to major commercial airlines  second and third tier airlines  cargo carriers  regional and low cost carriers  corporate fleets  fractional operators  private aircraft  military fleets and to the united states and foreign governments 
in december  we acquired avcard and the results of operations of this acquisition have been included in the aviation segment and our consolidated financial statements since december  avcard offers a private label charge card and sells aviation fuel and related services to the general aviation industry 
in our land segment  we offer fuel and related services to petroleum distributors operating in the land transportation market 
we compete by providing our customers value added benefits including single supplier convenience  competitive pricing  the availability of trade credit  price risk management  logistical support  fuel quality control and fuel procurement outsourcing 
our revenue and cost of sales are significantly impacted by world oil prices as evidenced in part by our revenue and cost of sales increases year over year while our gross profit is not necessarily impacted by the change in world oil prices as our profitability is driven by gross profit per unit which is not directly correlated to the price of fuel 
however  our gross profit can be impacted by significant rapid movements in fuel prices during any given financial period due to our inventory average costing methodology 
generally a significant rapid increase in fuel prices positively impacts gross profit during any given financial period  while decrease in fuel prices negatively impacts gross profit 
in our marine segment  we primarily purchase and resell fuel  and act as brokers for others 
profit from our marine segment is determined primarily by the volume and gross profit achieved on fuel resales and by the volume and commission rate of brokering business 
in our aviation and land segments  we primarily purchase and resell fuel  and we do not act as brokers 
profit from our aviation and land segments is primarily determined by the volume and the gross profit achieved on fuel resales 
our profitability in our segments also depends on our 
table of contents operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debt 
we may experience decreases in future sales volume and margins as a result of deterioration in the world economy  transportation industry  natural disasters and continued conflicts and instability in the middle east  asia and latin america  as well as potential future terrorist activities and possible military retaliation 
in addition  because fuel costs represent a significant part of our customers operating expenses  volatile and or high fuel prices can adversely affect our customers businesses  and consequently the demand for our services and our results of operations 
see item a risk factors of this form k 
reportable segments we have three reportable operating business segments marine  aviation and land 
corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage  where possible  or on other factors according to the nature of the activity 
financial information with respect to our business segments is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we evaluate and manage our business segments using the performance measurement of income from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenue and related costs of sales  bad debt  share based payments  derivatives  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of fuel is recognized when the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title passes to the customer  which is when the delivery of fuel is made to our customer directly from the supplier or a third party subcontractor 
our fuel sales are generated as a fuel reseller as well as from on hand inventory supply 
when acting as a fuel reseller  we contemporaneously purchase fuel from the supplier  mark it up  and resell the fuel to the customer  generally taking delivery for purchased fuel at the same place and time as the delivery is made 
we record the gross sale of the fuel as we generally take inventory risk  have latitude in establishing the sales price  have discretion in the supplier selection  maintain credit risk and are the primary obligor in the sales arrangement 
revenue from fuel related services is recognized when services are performed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record the gross sale of fuel related services as we generally have latitude in establishing the sales price  have discretion in supplier selection  maintain credit risk and are the primary obligor in the sales arrangement 
commission from fuel broker services is recognized when services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when acting as a fuel broker  we are paid a commission by the supplier 

table of contents revenue from charge card transactions is recognized at the time the purchase is made by the customer using the charge card 
revenue from charge card transactions is generated from processing fees 
accounts receivable and allowance for bad debt credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed by each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee 
the credit committees are responsible for approving credit limits above certain amounts  setting and maintaining credit standards  and managing the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon a customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to most of our customers 
accounts receivable are deemed past due based on contractual terms agreed with our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience with our customers  current market and industry conditions affecting our customers  and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for estimated credit losses 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see item a risk factors of this form k 
share based payment we account for share based payment awards on a fair value basis 
under fair value accounting  the grant date fair value of the share based payment is amortized as compensation expense  on a straight line basis  over the vesting period for both graded and cliff vesting awards 
annual compensation expense for share based payment is reduced by an expected forfeiture amount on outstanding share based payment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars 
the estimation of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected term of the stock options and ssars represents the estimated period of time from grant until exercise or conversion and is based on vesting schedules and expected post vesting  exercise and employment termination behavior 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
any adjustment to the historical volatility as an indicator of future volatility would be based on the impact to historical volatility of significant non recurring events that would not be expected in the future 
risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
dividend yields are based on the historical dividends of world fuel over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life  as adjusted for stock splits 
the estimated fair value of common stock  restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the grant date market value of our common stock  as defined in the respective plans under which they were issued 
derivatives we enter into derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine  aviation and land fuel  and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
we also enter into derivatives in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuation in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all derivatives are recognized at estimated fair market value based on quoted market prices or available market 
table of contents information 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative are recognized as a component of cost of sale in the statement of income 
derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting may be designated as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
for our fair value hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge and the hedged item are recognized in the same line item as a component of either revenue or cost of sales in the statement of income 
for our cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the changes in the fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet  while the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of interest expense in the statement of income 
cash flows for our hedging instruments used in our hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items 
if for any reason hedge accounting is discontinued  then any cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance shall be classified consistent with the nature of the instrument 
to qualify for hedge accounting  as either a fair value or cash flow hedge  the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective over an extended period of time in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk at the inception of the hedge 
we use a regression analysis based on historical spot prices in assessing the qualification for our fair value hedges 
however  our measurement of hedge ineffectiveness for inventory hedges utilizes spot prices for the hedged item inventory and forward or future prices for the hedge instrument 
therefore  the excluded component forward or futures prices in assessing hedge qualification  along with ineffectiveness  is included as a component of cost of sales in earnings 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective and any previously recorded fair market value changes are not adjusted until the fuel is sold 
for additional information on derivatives  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this form k 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents our cost in excess of the estimated fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  of acquired companies and the joint venture interest in pafco 
goodwill is not subject to periodic amortization  instead  it is reviewed annually at year end or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  which is the same as our reporting segments  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting segment is estimated using discounted cash flow and market capitalization methodologies 
in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded identifiable intangible assets existing at the date of the acquisitions for customer  charge card holder and merchant relationships  non compete agreements and trademark tradename 
our identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives  which are estimated as follows customer relationships ranging from to years  charge card holder relationships years  charge card merchant relationships years  non compete agreements to years  and trademark tradename indefinite 
indentifiable intangible assets are reviewed based on market factors and operational considerations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash as of december   as compared to million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  additionally  at december   our short term investments consisted of million of commercial paper with a par value of million  which was investment grade when purchased 
at the maturity date of the investment during august  the issuer of the commercial paper defaulted on its repayment obligation 
the commercial paper is no longer highly liquid and therefore a readily determinable fair market value of the investment is not available 
we have estimated the fair market value of the commercial paper based principally on the results of a valuation performed by a third party 
the valuation considered i the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  ii individual valuation estimates of the underlying collateral using multiple indicators of value  and iii the probabilities of repayment under various liquidation scenarios 
the results of the valuation yielded a range of estimated fair market values of our commercial paper investment from approximately million to approximately million 
the estimated fair market value of our commercial paper of million at december  could change significantly based on future market conditions and the ultimate settlement of our commercial paper could be for amounts materially different from our current estimate of fair market value 
as a result  additional impairment charges may be required in the future 
the commercial paper is classified as a short term investment as of december  based on information available to us that suggests that it is likely there will be a cash settlement of the commercial paper available to us within one year 
changes in facts and circumstances in future periods could lead to changes in the expected settlement date of the commercial paper balances 
accordingly  there may be changes in our classification of such balances from short term to long term 
at december   our short term investments consisted of auction rate securities with a par value of million  which approximated the market value 
we have not invested in any form of auction rate securities since july our primary use of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is to fund receivables and the purchase of inventories 
we are usually extended unsecured trade credit from our suppliers for our fuel purchases  however  certain suppliers require us to provide a letter of credit 
our ability to fund fuel purchases  obtain trade credit from our suppliers  and provide letters of credit is critical to our business 
increases in oil prices can negatively affect liquidity by increasing the amount of cash needed to fund fuel purchases as well as reducing the amount of fuel which we can purchase on an unsecured credit basis from our suppliers 
historically  we have not required significant capital investment in fixed assets for our businesses as we subcontract fueling services and maintain inventory at third party storage facilities 
however  we are currently in the post implementation phase of an enterprise integration project  which consists of a company wide financial and commercial information system upgrade 
the total expenditures required for this project through the stabilization period are currently estimated to be million 
as of december   we had capitalized million of project expenditures  of which million was incurred during also  as of december   we had expensed million in project expenses  of which approximately million was incurred during the balance of these expenditures is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of our business is funded through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments fluctuate primarily based on operating cash flow  most significantly  the timing of receipts from our customers and payments to our suppliers 
our credit facility permits borrowings of up to million with a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit and provides us the right to request increases in available borrowings up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings and million in issued letters of credit 
our available borrowings at december  under the credit facility were million 
higher interest rates can have a negative effect on our liquidity due to higher costs of borrowing under our credit facility 
as of december   we had two interest rate protection arrangements in the form of interest rate swaps in the amount of million each to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates 

table of contents these interest rate protection arrangements expire in march and april as of december   our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under the credit facility  adjusting for the interest rate swaps  was per annum 
our credit facility contains certain operating and financial covenants with which we are required to comply 
our failure to comply with the operating and financial covenants contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default 
an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility  trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party  and impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility 
we also have a separate million unsecured credit line for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees from one of the banks participating in our credit facility 
as of december   we had outstanding bank guarantees aggregating to million under this credit line 
net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million for as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for this million change in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a net increase in working capital 
in  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million compared to million for this million increase in cash used in investing activities was due to million cash used for the acquisition of avcard as compared to million cash used for the acquisition of the minority ownership interest of tramp oil brasil limitada 
partially offsetting these increases in cash used in investing activities was a million net proceeds from the sale of short term investments and a million decrease in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for as compared to million for this million increase was primarily due to a million increase in net borrowings under the credit facility and million us federal and state tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for share based awards  partially offset by million in restricted cash received as collateral from a customer  a million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  a million payment of loan costs for our senior revolving credit facility and a million increase in purchases of stock tendered by employees to satisfy the required withholding taxes related to share based awards 
working capital at december  was million  representing an increase of million from working capital at december  our accounts receivable  net  amounted to billion at december  as compared to million at december  this increase in net accounts receivable of million was primarily attributable to higher fuel prices  increased business activities and to the acquisition of avcard 
at december   the allowance for bad debt was million  a decrease of million as compared to december  inventories of million at december  increased million from december   primarily due to higher fuel prices 
prepaid expenses and other current assets of million at december  increased million from december   primarily due to increases in deposits for derivative margin calls and receivables related to transaction taxes 
our current liabilities increased million from december   primarily due to increases in accounts payable  payables related to derivative contracts  customer deposits and accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in accrued compensation  income tax payable and payables related to transaction taxes 
our long term liabilities increased million from december  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties fin liabilities recorded in accordance with our adoption of fin effective january  
table of contents shareholders equity was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in shareholders equity of approximately million was mainly due to million in earnings  million from the exercise of stock options and million of additional paid in capital in connection with share based payments 
partially offsetting these increases was a cumulative effect adjustment of million to retained earnings related to applying the new accounting guidance of fin  the declaration of million in dividends and million for the purchase of stock from employees to satisfy the required withholding taxes related to share based awards 
we believe that available funds from existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility  together with cash flows generated by operations  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to obtain financing are based on currently available information 
to the extent this information proves to be inaccurate  or if circumstances change  future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity would be adversely affected 
factors that may affect the availability of trade credit  or other forms of financing  include our performance as measured by various factors  including cash provided from operating activities  the state of worldwide credit markets  and our levels of outstanding debt 
in addition  we may decide to raise additional funds to respond to competitive pressures or changes in market conditions  to fund future growth  or to acquire businesses

sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and earlier adoption is prohibited

fair value option 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis with limited exceptions  is generally irrevocable  and must be applied to the entire financial instrument 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years that begin after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no

fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and recorded a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of approximately million related to the deferred gains of certain derivative transactions 
accordingly  the revenue and gross profit related to these transactions will not be recognized in our consolidated statements of income in when the transactions are scheduled to settle 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
will accelerate the recognition of profit associated with certain of our derivative transactions 
accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we enter into derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine  aviation and land fuel  and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
we also enter into derivatives in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuation in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all derivatives are recognized at estimated fair market value based on quoted market prices or available market information 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative are recognized as a component of cost of sale in the statement of income 
derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting may be designated as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
for our fair value hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge and the hedged item are 
table of contents recognized in the same line item as a component of either revenue or cost of sales in the statement of income 
for our cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the changes in the fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet  while the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of interest expense in the statement of income 
cash flows for our hedging instruments used in our hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items 
if for any reason hedge accounting is discontinued  then any cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance shall be classified consistent with the nature of the instrument 
to qualify for hedge accounting  as either a fair value or cash flow hedge  the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective over an extended period of time in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk at the inception of the hedge 
we use a regression analysis based on historical spot prices in assessing the qualification for our fair value hedges 
however  our measurement of hedge ineffectiveness for inventory hedges utilizes spot prices for the hedged item inventory and forward or future prices for the hedge instrument 
therefore  the excluded component forward or futures prices in assessing hedge qualification  along with ineffectiveness  is included as a component of cost of sales in earnings 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective and any previously recorded fair market value changes are not adjusted until the fuel is sold 
cash flow hedges 
we enter into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
we recorded an unrealized net gain of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which were included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
fair value hedges 
we enter into derivatives in order to hedge price risk associated with our inventories 
accordingly  inventories designated as hedged items are marked to market through the statement of income  as is the derivative that serves as the hedge instrument 
as a result  gains and losses attributable to changes in fuel prices are offset based on the effectiveness of the hedge instrument in the period in which the hedge is in effect 
effective in the fourth quarter of  we also designated derivatives as fair value hedge instruments in order to hedge price risk associated with certain fixed price purchase and sale firm commitments 
during the fourth quarter of  fair value hedge accounting was applied to hedge certain firm commitments which were elected for treatment under the normal purchase and normal sales exemption and subsequently designated as hedged items in fair value hedges 
changes in the fair value of hedged sales commitments and their related hedge instruments are recorded in revenues in our consolidated statement of income  while changes in the fair value of hedged purchase commitments and inventories and their related hedge instruments are recorded in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income 
we recorded an unrealized net gain of less than million and million as of december  and  respectively  relating to the ineffectiveness of our fair value hedge positions on the respective dates 
non designated derivatives 
our non designated derivatives are primarily entered into in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine  aviation and land fuel in the form of swaps as well as fixed price purchase and sale contracts and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
in addition  non designated derivatives are also entered into to hedge foreign currency fluctuation 
the changes in fair value of our non designated commodity derivatives are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
the changes in fair value of our non designated foreign currency derivatives are recorded as a component of other income expense  net  in the statement of income 
we recorded an unrealized net loss of million and an unrealized net gain of less than million as of december  and  respectively  relating to our non designated derivatives positions on the respective dates

the mark to market amount includes million in unrealized net gains associated with purchase commitments that were previously non designated derivatives for which the normal purchase and normal sales election were made and subsequently were designated as hedged items in fair value hedges in the fourth quarter of the unrealized net gains were offset by million in unrealized net losses associated with swaps related to the purchase commitments 

table of contents interest rate borrowings under our million credit facility are subject to variable interest rates 
however  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate protection arrangements that  in effect  fix the rate of interest on our debt 
the amount of debt covered by such arrangements may change depending on our working capital needs 
as of december   we had two interest rate protection arrangements in the form of interest rate swaps in the amount of million each to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates 
these interest rate protection arrangements expire in march and april as of december   our total borrowing under our credit facility was million and our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility  adjusting for the interest rate swaps  was per annum 
based on our outstanding borrowings at december   our sensitivity to interest rates  inclusive of the interest rate swaps  with an assumed change would increase or decrease net income by million  or basic and diluted earnings of per share 
foreign currency the majority of our business transactions are denominated in united states dollars 
however  in certain markets  primarily mexico  colombia  chile  brazil  singapore  canada and the united kingdom  payments to our aviation fuel suppliers and from some of our customers are denominated in local currencies 
this subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk 
although we use hedging strategies to manage and attempt to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange risk  at any given time  only a portion of such risk may be hedged 
as of december   we had the following foreign currency purchase contracts in thousands settlement period hedge strategy foreign currency amount united states currency amount fair value asset liability january non designated brl non designated clp
