item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview as of february   we own luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and we are the largest lodging reit in the national association of real estate investment trust s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level 
host operates as a self managed and self administered reit and owns approximately of the partnership interests of host hotels resorts  lp  or host lp 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry 
the majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort convention destinations 
the target profile for our portfolio includes luxury and upper upscale hotels in urban and resort convention destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
the classification of a property as luxury or upper upscale is based on lodging industry standards  which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities  level of service and quality of accommodations 
though hotels meeting this target profile will still be subject to competitive pressures  we believe this strategy will allow us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors 
we also seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in maximizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business  and contract business  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our room sales 
similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers 
overall  business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels  with leisure travelers making up the remainder 
therefore  our business will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand 
the four key subcategories of the transient business group are premium sometimes referred to as rack rate  typically consists of rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality  weekday vs 
weekend stays 
corporate this is the benchmark rate which a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it is typically the second highest category  and is for travelers that do not have access to negotiate or discount rates 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally 
these rates are typically negotiated annually  at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate 
discount this encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 
group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion 
the following three key sub categories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 
other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 
the final category is contract demand  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on levels of the revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to operate the property  including to purchase inventory and to pay wages  utilities  property taxes and other expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers  which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation  from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  depending on the manager 
hotel revenue is approximately of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  telephone  entertainment and other guest services 
hotel operating expenses are approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental and support expenses 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking  golf courses  spas  telephones  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations 
it is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items  however  taken separately these costs represent approximately of our hotel operating expenses 
key performance indicators revenue per available room  or revpar  is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include food and beverage or parking  telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
revpar changes driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in these additional room related costs 
as a result  revpar increases due to higher room rates have a greater impact on our profitability versus increases in occupancy levels 
we discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage  large scale capital improvements or significant events during these periods 
we also have presented comparable hotel plus the starwood portfolio revpar 
this metric represents our comparable hotels described above plus the hotels acquired from starwood on april  that we own as of december  accordingly  we have included the results of the starwood portfolio for periods prior to our ownership in in the determination of the comparable hotel plus starwood portfolio revpar 
see comparable hotel and comparable hotel plus the starwood portfolio operating statistics for further detail 
we also evaluate the performance of our business through non gaap financial measures  including ffo per diluted share and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit 
see non gaap financial measures 
we use ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
see non gaap financial measures ffo per diluted share for further discussion 
another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit  which is a non gaap measure to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability 
the comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels 
see non gaap financial measures comparable hotel operating results for further discussion 
each of the non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit and earnings per share 
summary of operating results comparable hotel plus the starwood portfolio revpar increased in the revpar increase was the result of an increase in average room rates of and an increase in occupancy of percentage points 
for our comparable properties  revpar increased 
the growth in average room rate was driven by a number of positive factors  such as continued economic growth and low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels 
total revenue increased million  or  to billion for the year  primarily due to increases in revpar  as well as increases in food and beverage and other revenue items 
revenues for also reflects a full year of operations for the hotels acquired from starwood in april that we own as of december  revenues include  million in compared to million in from the starwood portfolio 
net income from continuing operations increased million in to million 
the increase was primarily the result of improved operating results at our hotels  increases in gains on insurance settlements  declines in corporate and other expenses primarily due to decreases in stock compensation expense and a decrease in non recurring costs as compared to which included costs associated with the starwood acquisition and a decline in interest expense 
net income decreased million to million in the decrease was due to a decline in gains on dispositions from million in compared to million in diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 
to in  while diluted earnings per share decreased 
to in ffo per diluted share increased  to  for ffo per diluted share was reduced by 
for due to costs associated with debt repayments or refinancings 
by comparison  ffo per diluted share was reduced by 
for for similar transactions  as well as costs associated with preferred stock redemptions and the starwood acquisition 
comparable hotel adjusted operating profit increased as a result of the increases in overall revenues at our hotels  described above  but was negatively affected by a increase in comparable hotel operating expenses 
the increase in expenses was driven by increases in wages and benefits at the hotels and by increased management fees 
investing activities acquisitions domestically  we did not complete any acquisitions during due to several factors 
during the first half of  increased demand for premium assets particularly from private equity funds and other buyers as a result of the availability of favorable debt financing and continued strong lodging fundamentals caused significant upward pressure on asset prices 
however  as the credit markets weakened in the second half of the year  favorable debt financing was not available and few luxury and upper upscale hotels were marketed to be sold 
as a result  management continued to focus on acquisitions in europe  where we believe there are opportunities for growth outside of the domestic lodging cycle 
consistent with this strategy  our european joint venture purchased three properties located in brussels  belgium in july as a result of the acquisition  the european joint venture now holds over billion in lodging assets and reflects a geographically diversified portfolio with ten properties in five countries 
capital expenditures during  we continued to enhance the competitiveness of our properties through one of the largest capital expenditure programs in our history 
this program consists of roi repositioning and value enhancement projects as well as maintenance capital expenditures 
these projects are focused on lobbies  public space  food and beverage facilities  spas  retail outlets  energy conservation  non guest areas  meeting space and rooms 
over the past two years  we have spent billion on capital expenditures  including million in we spent approximately million in on roi repositioning projects and value enhancement projects at properties 
these projects included the completion of the  square foot exhibit hall at the orlando world center marriott  which opened in october  and several significant projects at the atlanta marriott marquis  including the construction of new food and beverage facilities  renovation of all existing break out space and the construction of a new  square foot ballroom  which is scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of additionally  at the jw marriott  desert springs resort  we recently renovated the lobby and opened a completely renovated spa  which expanded the size of the spa to  square feet 
during  our renewal and replacement capital expenditures totaled million and included the renovation of over  rooms and over  square feet of meeting space 
dispositions during  we took advantage of market conditions to dispose of nine properties where we believed the potential for long term revenue growth was lower 
proceeds from these sales were approximately million and were used to repay debt  invest in our portfolio  or for general corporate purposes 
we recorded a gain on these sales of million  net of tax  in the interest from perspective buyers slowed during the second half of due to the decline in the availability of financing as the credit markets tightened 
financing activities maintaining our strong interest coverage and leverage ratios remains a key management priority and  as a result of continued growth in cash flow at our properties and the repayment and refinancing of debt  we significantly improved our interest coverage and leverage ratios during during  we issued approximately billion of debt  including million of exchangeable senior debentures and million of mortgage debt 
the proceeds  along with cash from hotel dispositions and available cash  were used to retire or prepay billion of debt  which included billion of mortgage debt  million outstanding under our credit facility and million of senior notes 
importantly  we only have million of debt maturing plus million of principal amortization in outlook we believe that the economic drivers that impact underlying lodging fundamentals  such as growth in gdp  business investment and employment  are likely to weaken in the expected decline in these drivers will likely result in a significantly lower revenue growth rate for our hotels than was experienced in and while demand growth could moderate as a result of slowing economic drivers  projections for new supply in the markets in which we own hotels suggest that supply growth will also continue to fall short of long term historical averages 
while the pace of new lodging supply in various phases of development has increased over the past several quarters  the majority of new projects scheduled for completion in the near term are largely concentrated in the economy and mid scale segments and are located outside of major urban markets 
therefore  we do not expect most of the new hotel supply to directly compete with our core portfolio 
we also believe the timing of some of these projects may be affected by increased building costs and the reduced availability of financing 
these factors may further dampen the pace of new supply development beyond we believe the slower economic growth in will likely result in lower transient demand  primarily from the corporate and leisure segments 
our group booking pace for is stronger than  however  the short term group bookings may not materialize to the same extent that they did in overall  we expect group demand to be similar to the levels achieved in based on this outlook  we believe the increases in revpar in will continue to be driven by increases in the average room rate rather than occupancy 
however  improvements in operating results will be constrained by increasing operating costs as well as certain costs increasing at a rate greater than inflation  including wages  benefits and real estate taxes 
we expect our current level of capital expenditures and investment projects will continue through as a result of this program  certain properties will continue to experience temporary business interruption during due to the size and number of projects we expect to complete early in  the disruption may be particularly significant in the first half of the year and  as a result  our operating margins will be adversely affected 
however  over the long term  we expect to see improvements in revpar and operating margins as these projects are expected to enhance our properties competitive market position and profitability 
as a result of these trends and our efforts to improve the portfolio  we expect that for the hotels that we consider comparable in  which includes the starwood portfolio  revpar will increase approximately to when compared to we anticipate that despite the recent tightening of the domestic credit markets  which we expect to restrict other potential buyers  investment opportunities for asset acquisitions in domestic urban and resort locations will continue to be limited for us 
liquidity concerns should moderate the increases in valuations that have occurred in recent years and limit the number of buyers who utilize higher levels of leverage 
consequently  owners will not likely be willing to sell their hotels at lower price levels initially  which  in the near term  will reduce the number of domestic properties available that will meet our return on investment requirements 
additionally  we expect that the decline in prospective buyers due to the tightening of the credit market will continue to limit our dispositions in however  we believe that in international markets  particularly in europe  asia and latin america  there are more opportunities wherein we can leverage our investment through the use of joint ventures to acquire quality properties 
as a result of the current strength of our balance sheet  and the number of sources of liquidity available to us see liquidity and capital resources  we feel we are well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise 
in  we declared a total dividend of per share 
for  we expect to declare a fixed 
per share common dividend each quarter as well as a special dividend in the fourth quarter  which  based on our current outlook  will be similar to the level 
the amount of any dividend will be determined by host s board of directors 
as we believe the trends in the lodging industry provide less opportunity for improvements in our business in  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns

comparable hotel plus the starwood portfolio revpar increased in and comparable hotel revpar increased as of december   of our hotels have been classified as comparable hotels 
the increase in revpar was the result of strong growth in average room rates and a slight increase in occupancy 
the growth in average room rate was driven by increasing demand due to strong economic growth in the first half of and low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels 
as a result of these trends  our operators were able to continue to increase room rates  while marginally improving the year over year occupancy levels 
however  occupancy was affected at a number of our hotels by our capital expenditure program  which is described below  as well as weakness in individual markets 
food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased  primarily due to increased sales from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals 
in addition  operating margins at our food and beverage outlets increased percentage points 
other revenues for our comparable hotels  which primarily represent spa  golf  parking  internet connectivity and other fees  increased 
while management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market  overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria property type ie urban  suburban  resort convention or airport  geographic region and mix of business ie transient  group or contract

for  revpar increased across all of our hotel property types  led by our urban hotels  as we benefited from strong performance in several downtown markets such as boston  new york  and san francisco 
we also experienced revpar growth at our suburban hotels due to strong performances at our suburban boston  denver and los angeles hotels 
revpar growth at our airport hotels was led by our san francisco and houston airport hotels

for further discussion  see reporting periods 
for  our mid atlantic region continued to be the top performing region due to exceptional revpar growth by our new york city hotels driven by strong business and leisure transient demand and average room rate increases 
the new england region also performed well due to increased city wide events in the boston market  particularly during the second half of the year  as this market was affected by lower levels of group and transient demand during the first half of the year 
increases in revpar for our pacific  washington dc and mountain regions were generally consistent with the levels for the overall portfolio 
increases in revpar in our pacific region were driven by the los angeles and san francisco markets 
the los angeles market grew due to increased average room rates for transient business along with a strong group base 
the san francisco market had a strong year driven by city wide events 
the growth in the washington dc region was driven by the performance of our downtown hotels  which was partially offset by weak performance by our suburban properties in the region 
revpar growth during the year in the florida region was moderate  as group activity was slow due to hurricane concerns and renovation displacement at several hotels including the harbor beach marriott resort and spa and the tampa marriott waterside hotel and marina 
the weak revpar growth in the atlanta region was due to lower levels of occupancy  as city wide demand decreased from the unusually strong performance in that reflected business relocation from new orleans due to hurricane katrina 
however  in the fourth quarter  the atlanta region experienced revpar increases due to strong group bookings in the mid town area 
the north central region under performed the portfolio primarily due to weakness in the chicago market 
hotel sales by business mix 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient  group and contract business 
individual travelers are referred to as transient customers 
those traveling as part of an organized group  meeting or convention are referred to as group customers 
contract customers represent blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates  such as airline crews 
the information below is derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers 
in  relatively strong demand levels allowed our operators to increase average daily room rates  particularly in the corporate transient segments 
overall transient average daily rates increased when compared to last year and our overall group average room rate for these hotels increased almost 
we expect that the ability to achieve increases in average daily rates will moderate in in conjunction with expectations for weaker economic and demand growth 
compared to hotel sales growth for was due to increases in revpar  as well as increases in food and beverage and other revenue items 
hotel sales include million in from the starwood portfolio 
sales for properties sold in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations below 
as of december   of our hotels were classified as comparable hotels 
comparable hotel sales increased to approximately billion for the revenue growth reflects the increase in comparable revpar of  as a result of an increase in average room rates of and a slight decrease in occupancy of percentage points 
the growth in average room rate was driven by a number of positive trends such as strong united states gdp growth  low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels and the strengthening in the group and transient segments of our business 
as a result of these trends  our operators were able to significantly increase average daily room rates and continued to manage the mix of business away from lower rated discount and contract business in favor of higher rated corporate transient and corporate and association group business 
however  this yield management at our hotels did result in fewer occupied rooms and was the primary factor for the slight occupancy decline 
occupancy was also affected by weakness in individual markets and temporary disruption to certain properties due to our capital expenditure program 
food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased  primarily due to increased sales from our catering and banquet business 
growth in sales of our food and beverage operations  which historically represent approximately of our revenues  also positively affected overall operating margins  as our managers continue to shift business from outlets to banquet sales

revpar growth at our resort convention hotels was driven by the revpar increases at our naples  florida and maui  hawaii resort convention hotels 
the increase in revpar at our airport hotels was less than the comparable portfolio as the increase in average room rates of was partially offset by decreases in occupancy of percentage points due  in part  to renovations at our san francisco airport hotels

our new england region was the top performing region due to very strong group demand at our downtown boston hotels 
the north central region also performed well primarily due to an increase in the average room rate and the average occupancy 
the improvement was the result of strong growth across all segments of demand  particularly group demand at our six hotels in the chicago market  which benefited from a significant increase in the number of city wide convention events in additionally  increases in comparable hotel revpar in our mountain region were due primarily to revpar increases at our three comparable hotels in the denver market and our hotels in the phoenix scottsdale area 
revpar growth in our pacific and south central regions were moderate 
our pacific region benefited from strong revpar growth in the hawaii and san diego markets and our south central region had revpar increases driven primarily by strong increases in average room rate 
the dc region was our worst performing region 
comparable hotel revpar in the dc region was negatively affected by the renovations at the jw marriott  washington  dc  which had a significant number of rooms out of service for the first and second quarters of  as well as an overall decrease in congressional activity and a reduction in group business compared to  which included the effect of the presidential inauguration 
hotel sales by business mix 
in  overall demand was stronger and  therefore  our operators were able to significantly increase average daily room rates  particularly in the corporate transient segments 
overall transient average daily rates increased when compared to last year and our overall group average room rate for these hotels increased almost 
the gap between transient rates and group rates widened in  indicating that pricing power remained strong 
the information above was derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers 
compared to and compared to rental income 
our rental income represents lease income from our leased hpt properties and three office property leases  as well as lease income from one upper upscale hotel 
rental income improved million in from and million in from primarily due to the increase in operations at the leased hpt properties as a result of investments in the properties by the lessor and improvements in the overall economy 
property level operating expenses change to change to in millions in millions rooms food and beverage other departmental and support expenses management fees other property level expenses depreciation and amortization total property level operating expenses operating expenses increased each year from to due to several factors  particularly  inflation and increases in revenue driven costs at our properties 
our operating costs and expenses  which are both fixed and variable  are affected by changes in occupancy  inflation and revenues  though the effect on specific costs will differ 
for example  utility costs include a fixed component but will increase based on occupancy and with inflation  while depreciation expense is fixed except for increases as a result of acquisitions and capital expenditures 
similarly  management fees are directly effected by total revenues as well as the level of operating profit at each property 
additionally  property level operating expenses include the property level expenses of the starwood portfolio for a full year or approximately million in comparatively  property level operating expenses for include starwood portfolio expenses for the period from april  the purchase date through year end of million 
fiscal year has no property level expenses for the starwood portfolio 
property level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold  which are included in discontinued operations 
corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits including stock based compensation expense  as well as other costs such as travel  corporate insurance  audit fees  building rent and system costs 
in  corporate expenses decreased approximately million from due to the decrease in compensation expense recorded for our stock based compensation awards primarily due to the decline of our stock price and a significant decrease in the number of shares vested and a decrease in non recurring costs  such as those costs recorded from the acquisition of the starwood portfolio and other transactions 
in  corporate expenses increased approximately million from due to an increase in compensation expense based on the strong performance of our stock price and an increase in overall staffing levels  as well as non recurring costs of million associated with the starwood acquisition 
gain on insurance settlement 
we recorded a gain on insurance settlement of million in  million in and million in the gains relate to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following hurricanes katrina and wilma which occurred during september and october the hurricanes caused substantial business interruption and property damage at our new orleans marriott and at five of our hotels located in southern florida 
during  we reached final settlement with our insurers on all of these claims 
during  we recognized a gain of million related to business interruption insurance proceeds received as a result of lost profit primarily at our new orleans marriott 
additionally  all of the insurance gains of million in and million in represent business interruption insurance proceeds 
the remaining gain of million in related to insurance proceeds for property damages sustained by these properties 
the gain represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable recorded on the balance sheet at the date of loss 
the insurance receivable reflected the book value of the property and equipment written off and repairs and maintenance costs incurred from the hurricanes 
we recognize the gains on insurance settlements once all contingencies are met  and  as a result  none of the property insurance proceeds were recognized in income during or interest income 
interest income increased million in compared to and million in compared to due to an increase in our cash balance and an increase in the interest rate earned 
interest expense 
the decrease of million in interest expense for is primarily due to a net decrease in debt of approximately million and a decrease in our weighted average interest rate of percentage points to 
the decrease is partially offset by call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments totaling million for compared to similar costs of million for the increase of million in interest expense in from was primarily due to a net increase in debt of approximately million and increased rates for our variable rate debt from the increase was partially offset by a decline from million in to million in for call premiums  accelerated deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and the early termination of our interest rate swap agreements associated with debt prepayments 
in addition  interest expense for includes approximately million of non recurring bridge loan fees and expenses related to the starwood acquisition 
minority interest expense 
minority interest expense decreased million in due to lower net income of host lp and a decline in the weighted average ownership percentage of the outside owners of host lp from to 
host lp income in included significant gains on dispositions  net of tax  of million 
in  the increase of million over was a result of the increase in the net income of host lp  as well as the net income of certain of our consolidated hotel partnerships that are partially owned by third parties 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
in  our share of income of affiliates increased by million over primarily due to an increase in earnings from our european joint venture  which was formed in however  in  our share of losses of affiliates increased by million compared to primarily due to the losses recorded from our investment in the european joint venture of million  which included our portion of a foreign currency hedge loss of million  as the venture hedged a portion of its initial investment for the acquisition of six of its hotels

gain loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
the gain on foreign currency and derivative contracts in is primarily due to the million increase in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts on two of our canadian hotels 
these agreements were terminated in the fourth quarter of discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we use cash for acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt payments  operating costs  corporate and other expenses and dividends to stockholders 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income excluding net capital gain to our stockholders in the form of dividends 
funds used to make these dividends are provided from host lp 
our sources of cash are cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  borrowing under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets 
we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
cash balances 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  which was an increase of million from december  in january  we paid the fourth quarter dividends of million on our common and preferred stock 
the increase in cash is primarily due to proceeds from asset sales and improved operations  partially offset by dividend payments and capital expenditures 
excluding amounts necessary for working capital  we intend to use the remaining available funds over time to further invest in our portfolio through capital expenditures and stock repurchases  acquire new properties  invest in foreign joint ventures or make further debt repayments 
we also have million available under our credit facility 
we believe we have ample liquidity and access to capital markets to take advantage of investment opportunities which may arise  continue our capital expenditures program  deal with our near term maturities and other obligations and to withstand an unanticipated decline in the cash flow from our business 
debt transactions 
we seek to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry  the debt capacity to buy assets in a downturn in the lodging cycle and the ability to continue to pay common stock dividends in the event that operations decline 
our financial flexibility is partially dependent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our debt agreements 
in particular  the covenants under our credit facility and our senior notes indenture include  among others  the allowable amounts of leverage  coverage and fixed charges 
our ability to incur new debt  pay dividends and make investments is dependent upon compliance with these covenants 
the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility is a key component of our capital structure

we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors

the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issues by host lp  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lp s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp 
the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  as well as our credit facility  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
because our leverage ratio is below this threshold  we have the right to release all pledges at any time 
in october  we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have been otherwise required subsequent to this date 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x by host lp 
host lp is able to make distributions to enable host to pay dividends on its preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our ebitda to interest coverage ratio is above to this ratio is calculated in accordance with our senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as interest on our convertible subordinated debentures  call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the calculation is based on our pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions  such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings  as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate values and secured indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as our ability to pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our equity interests  make investments  permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries  sell assets  guarantee indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
as of december   we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our senior notes indentures 
million exchangeable senior debentures 
on march   host lp issued million exchangeable senior debentures the debentures and received proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees and expenses and original issue discount 
the debentures mature on april  and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes 
interest is payable quarterly in arrears on january  april  july and october of each year beginning on july  holders have the right to require us to repurchase the debentures on april   april  and april  for cash equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
holders may exchange their debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions  including when the closing sale price of host s common stock is more than of the exchange price per share for at least of consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption 
on exchange  we must deliver cash in an amount equal to not less than the lower of the exchange value which is the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the average price of our common shares and the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be exchanged  and  at our option  shares  cash or a combination thereof for any excess above the principal value 
we can redeem for cash all  or part of  the debentures at any time on or after april  upon days notice at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
if we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price  we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures at the exchange value described above rather than receive the cash redemption price 
the current exchange rate is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to an exchange price of per share of host common stock 
the exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances including the payment of common dividends exceeding 
per share in any given quarter

the current exchange rate is shares for each  of principal amount of the debentures  which is equivalent to an exchange price of per share 
the exchange rate is adjusted for certain circumstances  including the payment of all common dividends 
we can redeem for cash all  or part of  the debentures at any time subsequent to april  upon days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture 
if we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price  we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures for stock rather than receive the cash redemption price 
credit facility general 
on may   we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility which we refer to as the credit facility with deutsche bank ag new york branch  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  citicorp north america inc  soci t g n rale and calyon new york branch  as co documentation agents and certain other agents and lenders 
the credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of million 
during any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x  new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed million 
the credit facility also includes subcommitments for i the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million and ii loans in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of million  a million of which may be loaned to certain of our canadian subsidiaries in canadian dollars and b million of which may be loaned to us in pounds sterling and euros 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of september we have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met in september subject to certain conditions  we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders  whether or not currently party to the credit facility  commits to be a lender for such amount 
currently  there are no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and is currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
as with the prior facility  the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied  including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as a result of having satisfied such conditions under the prior credit facility  currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary  and at our elections  may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility  as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
financial covenants 
while the financial covenants under the credit facility are generally comparable to those contained in our prior facility including covenants concerning leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage  they are set at less restrictive levels than the corresponding covenants contained in our prior facility 
specifically  prior to the end of our third quarter of  we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than x 
thereafter  the maximum leverage ratio under the credit facility is reduced to x  with the minimum unsecured coverage ratio continuing to be set at x 
in all cases  if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x  new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed million 
the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding  we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants 
as of december   our leverage ratio is x versus the x maximum leverage ratio allowed under the credit facility and our fixed charge coverage ratio is x versus the x minimum fixed charge coverage ratio allowed under the credit facility 
accordingly  we are in compliance with these and all of our other financial covenants under the credit facility as of december  the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility financial covenant levels year minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio a maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio b a if  at any time our leverage ratio is above x  our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to x 
b the maximum leverage ratio declines to x at the end of the third quarter  and remains at x thereafter 
interest and fees 
we pay interest on borrowings under the credit facility at floating interest rates plus a margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio 
in the case of libor borrowings in us dollars  as well as euros and pounds sterling denominated borrowings  the rate of interest ranges from basis points to basis points over libor  which represents a reduction from the previous spread of to basis points over libor due to the amended credit facility 
based on our current leverage ratio of x  we can borrow at a rate of libor plus basis points 
to the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment 
the commitment fee has been reduced from a range of to basis points to a range of to basis points 
other covenants 
the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters 
certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
additionally  the credit facility s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture 
these provisions  under certain circumstances  limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing  and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain our tax status as a reit 
mortgage and other debt general 
as of december   we had assets that were secured by mortgage debt 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
as of december   secured debt represented approximately of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of and an average maturity of years 
the following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of december  in millions balance as of december  thereafter mortgage debt orlando marriott world center   due san diego marriott hotel and marina   due atlanta marriott marquis   due the westin kierland   due harbor beach marriott resort and spa   due the ritz carlton  naples and newport beach marriott bayview   due desert springs  a jw marriott resort and spa   due the westin tabor center   due other mortgage debt total mortgage debt other debt philadelphia airport marriott industrial revenue bonds   due capital leases and other total other debt total mortgage and other debt beginning in  the interest rate on these loans increases a minimum of basis points and all excess cash as defined in the loan agreement generated by the partnerships that own these two properties is applied to principal  however  the loans can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date 
the amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate  but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow 
other mortgage debt consists of individual mortgage debt amounts that are less than million  have an average interest rate of at december  and mature through capital leases and other consist of three loans with an average interest rate of that mature through  and capital leases with varying interest rates and maturity dates 
mortgage debt of consolidated and unconsolidated partner interests for the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party minority partnership interests  the proportion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the minority owners  based on their percentage of ownership of the partnerships  is approximately million 
additionally  we have minority interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method 
the proportion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships attributable to us  based on our percentage of ownership of the partnerships  was million at december  approximately of this debt balance is due to our ownership interest in the european joint venture 
the debt of our unconsolidated partnerships is non recourse to us 
credit ratings currently  we have approximately billion of senior notes outstanding and million of preferred stock that are rated by moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings 
moody s rating on our senior notes debt is ba and our preferred stock is ba standard poor s rating on our senior debt is bb and the rating on our preferred stock is b 
fitch s rating on our senior notes debt is bb and our preferred stock is bb 
if our operations or our credit ratios were to decline  the ratings on our securities could be reduced 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue additional senior notes  either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise  or additional preferred stock would likely increase 
dividend policy host is required to distribute at least of its annual taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to its stockholders to qualify as a reit  including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash 
funds used by host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from host lp 
for every share of common and preferred stock of host  host lp has issued to host a corresponding common op unit and preferred op unit 
as of february   host is the owner of substantially all of the preferred op units and approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
investors should take into account the minority position in host lp common op units when analyzing common and preferred dividend payments by host to its stockholders  as these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding common and preferred op units 
when host pays a common or preferred dividend  host lp pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred op units 
for example  if host paid a per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on payment of a per common unit distribution by host lp to host  as well as to other common op unit holders 
host s current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute  over time  of its estimated annual taxable income 
host intends to pay a regular quarterly dividend of per share  and  in addition  to declare a special dividend during the fourth quarter of each year  the amount of which will vary depending on host s level of estimated taxable income 
host currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock  regardless of the amount of taxable income  unless contractually restricted 
the amount of any dividends will be determined by host s board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated investments 
we have invested approximately million million in the european joint venture 
under the joint venture s partnership agreement  the aggregate size of the european joint venture can increase to approximately million of equity of which approximately million would be contributed by host lp and  once all funds have been invested  would be approximately billion of assets 
the european joint venture currently has million of debt outstanding  none of which is recourse to us 
as of december   the aggregate size of the european joint venture was approximately billion billion  including total capital contributions of approximately million million  of which a total of approximately million million was from the contribution by us of cash and the sheraton warsaw hotel towers 
in connection with the european joint venture  the partners agreed that they would not individually make investments that are consistent with the european joint venture s investment parameters for a period of two years three years in the case of host or until at least of its committed capital is called or reserved for use prior to such date 
on february   we entered into a foreign currency forward purchase contract to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the european joint venture 
we hedged million million of our investment and the forward purchase will occur in august the derivative is considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  and  in accordance with sfas  will be marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholder s equity portion of our balance sheet 
we also have other unconsolidated investments with a total of million in debt with various partners 
for additional detail on these investments and the european joint venture  see note  investments in affiliates  and note  leases  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  hms host and barcel crestline corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host 
we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of five hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
these agreements require that we indemnify the owners for their tax consequences resulting from our selling the hotel or refinancing the mortgage debt during the period under the agreements  most of which will expire between and we also have agreed not to sell more than of the original allocated value attributable to a portfolio of additional hotels  or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for federal income tax purposes 
because the timing of these potential transactions is within our control  we believe that the likelihood of any material indemnification to be remote and  therefore  not material to our financial statements 
on average  these restrictions will generally expire  or cease to be significant  in guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of two hotels in january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote  and in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate 
future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the hpt subleases of approximately million and million  respectively  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed 
see capital expenditures 
the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense based upon fin under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel  and  is therefore  not determinable 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates purchase price allocations to hotels 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

any remaining unallocated acquisition costs would be treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
impairment testing 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired  whereby  future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the hotel 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge when a property s fair value is less than its net book value 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel s net book value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our hotels  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows holding period expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  assumptions  future changes in economic conditions  or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges  which would be reflected in operations in the future 
classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we will typically classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met our board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
to the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
see the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  of consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we will occasionally enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps  caps and collars 
derivative instruments are fair valued each quarter and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss unless the instrument qualifies as a hedge under sfas we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
stock compensation 
we recognize costs resulting from our share based payment transactions in our financial statements over their vesting periods 
we classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity classified awards or liability classified awards 
the classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is primarily based upon cash settlement options 
equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant 
liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
the value of these restricted stock awards  less estimated forfeitures  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
all restricted stock awards to senior executives have been classified as liability awards  primarily due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum withholding 
restricted stock awards to our upper middle management have been classified as equity awards as these awards do not have the optional tax withholding feature 
we utilize a simulation  or monte carlo  model to determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards classified as liability awards 
the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates  the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 
we have recorded approximately million of compensation expense related to our share based payment awards during consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
currently  we have investments in entities that own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
these entities are considered to be voting interest entities 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to us and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material 
while we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures  if we were required to do so  then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements 
application of new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations  fas r 
fas r provides principles on the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
the standard particularly requires the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value  including contingent considerations 
furthermore  fas r prohibits acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  from being applied in the determination of fair value 
we will adopt the provisions of this statement beginning in the first quarter of prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will materially affect the recognition and measurement related to our future business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 fas  which defines a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary as the portion of the equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent and requires noncontrolling interest to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
fas also modifies the presentation of net income by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests 
we will adopt this standard beginning in the first quarter of prospectively and any presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively 
upon the adoption of this standard  we will reclassify interests of our minority partners from the mezzanine level of the balance sheet to stockholders equity 
as of december   this balance totaled million 
additionally  the income attributable to minority partners will no longer be deducted in our determination of net income and net income would have increased by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
however  the expense will be deducted in our determination of net income available to common shareholders 
therefore  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our income available to common shareholders or our diluted earnings per share 
the fasb recently proposed fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp a 
the proposed fsp specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the instrument s issuance date when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
our debentures exchangeable debentures are within the scope of fsp a  therefore  we would be required to record the debt portions of our exchangeable debentures at their fair value on the date of issuance and amortize the discount into interest expense over the life of the debt 
however  there would be no effect on our cash interest payments 
applying fsp a to our debentures would decrease our diluted earnings per share and our ffo per diluted share by approximately 
in the effective date for this fsp a has not been determined 
comparable hotel and comparable hotel plus the starwood portfolio operating statistics we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption  or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared 
of the hotels that we owned on december   have been classified as comparable hotels 
the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december  are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods atlanta marriott marquis major renovation started august  new orleans marriott property damage and business interruption from hurricane katrina in august  the westin kierland resort spa acquired in september  and consolidated hotels that we acquired from starwood on april  additionally  the operating results of the hotels we disposed of in and also are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 
moreover  because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments 
in addition to comparable hotel revpar  we also have presented comparable hotel plus the starwood portfolio revpar 
this represents our comparable hotels described above plus the hotels acquired from starwood on april  that we own as of december  accordingly  we have included the results of the starwood portfolio for periods prior to our ownership in in the determination of the comparable hotel plus starwood portfolio revpar 
given the significance of the starwood portfolio to our operating results  we believe this supplemental presentation provides useful information to investors 
we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type 
these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry 
geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed pacific california  hawaii  oregon and washington  mountain arizona and colorado  north central illinois  indiana  michigan  minnesota  missouri and ohio  south central louisiana  tennessee and texas  new england connecticut  massachusetts and new hampshire  mid atlantic pennsylvania  new jersey and new york  dc metro maryland  virginia and washington  dc  atlanta georgia and north carolina  florida florida  and international canada  mexico and chile 
property types consist of the following urban hotels located in primary business districts of major cities  suburban hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets  resort convention hotels located in resort convention destinations such as arizona  florida  hawaii and southern california  and airport hotels located at or near airports 
reporting periods for consolidated statement of operations 
the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott  the manager of a significant percentage of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt and starwood  report results on a monthly basis 
host  as a reit  is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as the calendar year 
two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott  another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately based on total revenues of our hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year except in the case of fourth quarters comprised of seventeen weeks such as fiscal year versus sixteen weeks 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations 
hotel result reporting periods for operating statistics and comparable hotel results for marriott managed properties start end dates no

of days first quarter december march december march december march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september january september december september december non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures  which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  within the meaning of applicable sec rules 
they are as follows i funds from operations ffo per diluted share  and ii comparable hotel operating results 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ffo per diluted share we present ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo defined as set forth below for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 
we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation  capital expenditures and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders benefit 
the following tables provide a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders per share to ffo per diluted share in millions  except per share amounts reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to funds from operations per diluted share year ended december  income shares per share amount income shares per share amount net income available to common stockholders adjustments gain on dispositions  net of taxes gain on insurance settlements a amortization of deferred gains  net of taxes depreciation and amortization partnership adjustments ffo of minority partners of host lp b adjustments for dilutive securities assuming distribution of common shares granted under the comprehensive stock plan less shares assumed purchased at average market price assuming conversion of exchangeable senior debentures assuming conversion of convertible subordinated debentures ffo per diluted share c d a represents the gain during the period from the settlement of property insurance claims  including the gains that are included in discontinued operations related to hotels that we have sold 
b represents ffo attributable to the minority interests in host lp 
c ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities 
dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans  those preferred op units held by minority partners  convertible debt securities and other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common op units 
no effect is shown for securities if they are anti dilutive

comparable hotel operating results we present certain operating results for our hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
valuations for secured debt are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk adjusted rates 
senior notes and the convertible subordinated debentures are valued based on quoted market prices 
currently  all of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate and we have no derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge interest rate risk or that are held for trading purposes 
however  going forward  we may use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to future borrowings 
the table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value in millions liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate total debt as of december   all of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
our current debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments 
our credit facility is sensitive to changes in interest rates  which is based on a spread over libor  ranging from basis points to basis points 
there were no amounts outstanding on our credit facility at december  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment that ranges from to basis points 
during march  we prepaid our million mortgage on the jw marriott  washington  dc as a result  we terminated an interest rate cap that capped the floating interest rate of the loan at 
the cap represented a derivative that was marked to market each period and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap were recorded in gain loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
as of december   approximately of our debt bore interest at variable rates  which included our jw marriott  washington  dc mortgage  based on libor plus basis points  and our credit facility  based on libor plus a spread of basis points to basis points 
during  we terminated our interest rate swap agreements related to our series g and i senior notes for approximately million and million  respectively 
as we received fixed rate payments and paid floating rate payments under the swap agreements  we designated them as fair value hedges and amounts paid or received were recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
exchange rate sensitivity as we have non us operations specifically  the ownership of hotels in canada  mexico  chile and our european joint venture  currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotels  where possible  we may enter into forward or option contracts 
the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into in the past were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
as of december   we have no outstanding foreign currency contracts 
on february   we entered into a foreign currency forward purchase contract to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the european joint venture 
we hedged million million of our investment and the forward purchase will occur in august the derivative is considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  and  in accordance with sfas  will be marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholder s equity portion of our balance sheet
