item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and manufacture application platform solutions that enable leading original equipment manufacturers  or oems  independent software vendors  or isvs  and service providers to deliver their software applications in the form of a network ready device 
application platforms are pre configured network infrastructure devices designed to optimally deliver specific software application functionality  ease deployment  improve integration and manageability  accelerate time to market and increase the security of that software application in a customer s network 
we offer application platform customers an extensive suite of services associated with the design  development  manufacturing  brand fulfillment and post sale support of these devices 
we produce  brand and fulfill devices branded for our customers  and derive our revenues primarily from the sale of value added hardware platforms to these customers 
our customers subsequently resell and support the platforms under their own brands to their customer bases 
on october   we acquired privately held alliance systems  inc alliance systems  a leading provider of application platforms and related equipment to global carrier communications companies and enterprise communications service providers 
based in plano  texas  alliance systems provided application platforms and enhanced support services for wireless  voice over internet protocol voip  contact center and enterprise communications applications 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery to customers if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
in the event we have unfulfilled future obligations  revenue and related costs are deferred until those future obligations are met 
we have an inventory consignment agreement with our largest customer related to certain application platforms 
this customer notifies us when it utilizes inventory and we recognize revenues from sales to this customer based upon these notifications 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with the initial application platform sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance fees are typically for one to three year renewable periods and include the right to unspecified software updates when and if available for certain agreements  hardware repairs  hour customer support  on site support  and advanced replacement of application platforms 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are included in deferred revenue 
the associated costs of maintenance are expensed in the same period as incurred 

table of contents contracts and or customer purchase orders generally serve as the evidence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and consignment usage notifications are used to verify shipment or transfer of ownership  as applicable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  such as the sale of both product and post sales support and or extended warranty and related services element  in which software is not incidental to the product as a whole  we determine fair value based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which is typically established through contractual post sales support renewal rates whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the application platform 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements in which software is not included or is incidental to the product as a whole  we allocate revenue to the extended warranty and related services element based on separately priced contractual rates for those elements 
we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each element of the sale are met 
if we are not able to derive the fair value of the undelivered element of the sale ie maintenance  all revenues from the arrangement are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the support arrangement  which is typically one to three years 
we include shipping and handling costs reimbursed by our customers  if any  as net revenues and cost of revenues 
we record provisions for estimated sales returns in the same period the related revenues are recorded  as a reduction of revenue 
these provisions are based on historical return experience 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market value  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future 
any rapid technological changes and future product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
agreements with certain of our customers include inventory protection provisions  however  these provisions may not provide us with complete protection from loss due to excess or obsolete inventory 
product warranty obligations we offer a standard warranty on our products that generally provides for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue and record warranty expense as a component of cost of revenues 
costs included in our standard warranty obligation include shipping  internal and external labor  and travel 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating our warranty reserve 
although our application platform solutions primarily use standards based technologies  certain of our application platform solutions incorporate proprietary technologies  which may increase our risks related to product warranty obligations 
in the past we have experienced unexpected component failures in certain of our application platform solutions  which have required us to increase our product warranty accruals 
at the time any unexpected component failure arises  we assess the costs to repair any defects and record what we believe to be an appropriate warranty obligation based on the information available 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs associated with servicing those claims  or use estimates that prove to be materially different from actual claims  our product warranty obligations may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross profits 

table of contents stock based compensation effective october   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires us to measure compensation cost at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and to recognize that cost as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
under fas r  we determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date using an option pricing model 
such an option pricing model requires us to make judgments for certain assumptions used  in particular  the expected term of the option and the expected volatility over that term 
for stock options granted on or after january   we determined the expected term based on analysis of our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation behavior 
for stock options granted prior to january   we determined the expected term using the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the options  also known as the simplified method described under securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we have determined the expected volatility based on a weighted average of the historical volatility of the market price of our common stock 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  judgment is also required to estimate forfeitures of the awards based on the probability of employees completing the required service periods 
historical forfeitures are used as a starting point for developing our estimate of future forfeitures 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review goodwill for impairment annually as of the fiscal year end date  and more frequently if certain indicators are present 
when conducting our impairment evaluation  we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit 
we have determined that the reporting unit is the company as a whole 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of the goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess  if any 
fair value is calculated using widely accepted valuation techniques  including the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require significant judgments by management 
conditions that could trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in certain agreements  an economic downturn in our customers industries  increased competition  or other information regarding our market value  such as a reduction in our stock price 
during the quarter ended june   certain conditions existed that caused management to determine that a triggering event had occurred requiring an assessment of goodwill for impairment 
these indicators included a decline in the price of our common stock to a price that was below our carrying value for a period of time during the quarter  and revenues for the quarter ended june  that were lower than our expectations  resulting in a net loss for the quarter ended june  our assessment for impairment was conducted in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  which required us to determine the fair value of the company as a whole since it is considered the reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated 
we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing industry accepted valuation techniques that included the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and a market multiple approach  which considered our market capitalization adjusted for a control premium 
these valuation techniques require significant judgments by management  including estimates and assumptions about our projected future operating results  
table of contents discount rates  and long term growth rates 
our forecasts of future revenue were based on expected future growth from new as well as existing customers  and historical trends 
in addition  we considered the expected gross margins attainable in the future and the required level of operating expenses needed to conduct our business 
our impairment assessment resulted in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value  and therefore goodwill was not impaired as of june  our estimates used in determining the fair value were based on available information at the time we performed the impairment assessment 
we performed our annual impairment assessment as of september  step one of this assessment resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value 
in step two of the impairment analysis  the company compared the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined to be zero 
consequently  we determined that goodwill was fully impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the year ended september  the primary reasons for the difference in conclusions that goodwill was not impaired as of june   but was fully impaired as of september   were the continued decline in the price of our common stock during the quarter ended september   forecasts of future revenues which were lower than the forecasts used in the impairment analysis performed as of june   and lower revenues in the quarter ended september  as compared to the quarter ended june  and compared to our expectations for that quarter 
the forecasted revenues used in our september  analysis were lower than those used at june  as a result of the macroeconomic conditions and events that transpired in the global credit markets during september and october of we review long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the projected undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the long lived assets carrying value 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on the excess of the carrying value over fair value 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
factors that could lead to an impairment of acquired customer relationships recorded as a result of the alliance systems acquisition include  but are not limited to  a worsening in customer attrition rates compared to historical attrition rates  or lower than initially anticipated cash flows associated with customer relationships 
we tested our intangible asset  which consists of customer relationships recorded as a result of the acquisition of alliance systems  for recoverability as of september  we performed this assessment because we determined that the impairment of goodwill described above was an indicator that the carrying value of our intangible asset might not be recoverable 
as a result of this test  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible asset was recoverable  and therefore no impairment charge was recorded 
we also reassessed the remaining estimated useful life of the intangible asset  which is being amortized over its period of economic benefit of years 
we determined that no change to the estimated useful life was necessary 

table of contents income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at september   we believe that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the resulting reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit 
to the extent that net operating losses  when realized  relate to stock option deductions of approximately million  the resulting benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable  for which we do not require collateral 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debt write offs  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic conditions  accounts receivable aging trends and the payment terms we extend to our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  we may have to record additional allowances 
the allowance for bad debts can vary depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenues as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable  either through collection or write off 
comparability of financial information on october   we completed our acquisition of alliance systems 
as a result  the three month period ended march  was the first quarter that included the results of operations of alliance systems in our consolidated results for an entire quarter 
our financial results only include the financial results of alliance systems for periods subsequent to october  as such  the presentation of historical financial information and any discussion regarding the comparison of historical financial information does not include any financial information for alliance systems prior to october   unless otherwise indicated

discussion of fiscal years and net revenues our revenues are derived primarily from sales of application platform solutions to our oem  isv and service provider customers 
net revenues increased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to the acquisition of alliance systems on october  if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year  net revenues would have decreased by approximately million  when comparing pro forma net revenues for the years ended september  and the pro forma decrease would have been attributable primarily to lower sales volumes during the second half of fiscal year in the years ended september  and  net revenues from sales to emc totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total net revenues  respectively 
in addition  net revenues from other customers totaled million for the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september  this growth was primarily attributable to the acquisition of alliance systems 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues recognized less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of materials  warranty costs  inventory write downs  shipping and handling costs  customer support costs and manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs are primarily comprised of compensation  contract labor costs and  when applicable  contract manufacturing costs 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to lower gross margins associated with the alliance systems business and changes in customer and product mix 
gross profit is affected by customer and product mix  component material costs  pricing and the volume of orders 
we expect gross profit to continue to be affected by these factors

because our research and development expenses are project driven  the timing of these expenditures can vary 
if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year  research and development expenses would have decreased by approximately million  when comparing pro forma research and development expenses for the years ended september  and on a pro forma basis  there would have been decreases in compensation  primarily due to lower headcount  stock based compensation  consulting and other costs 

table of contents our application platform development strategy emphasizes the utilization of standard component technologies  which utilize off the shelf components 
however  we expect that in some cases  significant development efforts will be required to fulfill our current and potential customers needs using customized platforms 
we expect that prototype and consulting costs will be variable and could fluctuate depending on the timing and magnitude of our development projects 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for personnel engaged in sales and marketing  and costs associated with our marketing programs  which include costs associated with our attendance at trade shows  public relations  product literature costs  web site enhancements  and travel

if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year  general and administrative expenses would have decreased by approximately million  when comparing pro forma general and administrative expenses for the years ended september  and the pro forma decrease would have been attributable to decreases in compensation and stock based compensation expenses and other expenses 
the pro forma decrease in compensation and related expenses would have been primarily due to lower headcount during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year amortization of intangible asset amortization of the intangible asset increased by million for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  the increase was due to the amortization of the intangible asset related to the acquisition of alliance systems  which occurred on october  restructuring charge we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the fourth quarter of the year ended september   consisting of one time benefits associated with the termination of employees

in particular  as a result of this strategic change  we decreased headcount from at september  to at september  resulting in the decreases in compensation and related expenses and stock based compensation 
in addition  the reduction in marketing program expenses and travel was a result of reduced spending on end user lead generation programs for our ns series security appliances

non cash adjustments to net loss consisted primarily of a goodwill impairment charge of million  stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization expense of million 
changes in working capital primarily related to the use of million to settle accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by million and million in cash provided as the result of changes in accounts receivable and inventory  respectively 
changes in working capital were primarily driven by differences in the timing of cash receipts  cash disbursements  inventory receipts and invoicing to customers 
the use of cash to settle accounts payable and accrued expenses was related in part to the balances assumed in the acquisition of alliance systems  which we settled subsequent to the acquisition 
the change in accounts payable was also related to the fact that our last disbursement of cash prior to year end in fiscal year occurred closer to the year end date as compared to in fiscal year the change in accrued expenses was also related in part to the fact that accrued compensation included two days worth of accrued payroll costs at september   compared to five days worth at september  the change in accounts receivable was primarily related to collections of the receivable balances assumed in the acquisition of alliance systems  as well as the fact that revenues trended downward in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the change in inventories was primarily related to a slowing of purchasing 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which was related to the downward trend in revenues and lowered forecasts of future revenues from some of our larger customers 
changes in working capital for the year ended september  included an increase in deferred revenue of million  which was primarily related to the transfer of certain support obligations from microsoft 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during the year ended september  primarily related to the use of approximately million of cash for the acquisition of alliance systems 
financing activities cash used in financing activities during the year ended september  consisted primarily of million of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock 
employee stock option exercises and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan provided million of cash in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal we expect employee stock option exercises and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan to continue in fiscal  however  we cannot predict the level of cash inflows  given the volatility of our stock price 
on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through a share repurchase program 
as authorized by the program  shares may be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  in a manner consistent with applicable securities laws and regulations 
this stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be terminated at any time 
to facilitate repurchases of shares under this program  we established a rule b plan intended to comply with the requirements of rule b and rule b under the securities exchange act of a rule b plan permits the repurchase of shares by a company at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of company blackout periods  provided that the plan is adopted when the company is not aware of material non public information 
pursuant to the plan  a broker designated by us has the authority to repurchase shares  in accordance with the terms of the plan  without further direction from us 
the amount and timing of specific repurchases are subject to the terms of the plan and market conditions 
as of september   we had purchased  shares of our common stock under the repurchase program at an average price of per share including transaction costs 
upon the expiration of the b plan on november   we suspended repurchases of our common stock 
we may resume repurchases under the program at any time at the discretion of management 
line of credit on october   we entered into a loan and security agreement loan agreement with silicon valley bank the bank 
the term of this agreement was for one year  to end on october  the loan agreement provided the company with a million revolving loan facility 
the interest rate on this line was equal to one quarter of a point below the current prime rate with interest payable monthly 
on august   we and the bank entered into the first loan modification agreement the modification agreement 
the modification agreement amended the loan agreement to extend its term to august   and to change the amount of the revolving loan facility to million 
the modification agreement did not change the interest rate on the line 
we opted to lower the amount of the revolving loan facility from million to million in order to better reflect our potential borrowing needs and to reduce the fees we incur to maintain the loan facility

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make certain payments  as of september  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total operating leases capital lease obligation total our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and size of orders from our customers  the timeliness of receipts of payments from our customers  our ability to enter into partnerships with oems  isvs and service providers  the level of success of our customers in selling systems that include our application platform solutions  the costs and timing of product engineering efforts and the success of these efforts  and market developments 
we believe that our available cash resources and cash that we expect to generate from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we also received  during the first quarter of fiscal year  million of the million income tax receivable which was recorded on our balance sheet as of september  our future liquidity would also be positively impacted to the extent that we are able to recover all or part of the million of contingently returnable acquisition consideration which was recorded on our balance sheet as of september  in connection with the acquisition of alliance systems 
in the event that our available cash resources and our silicon valley bank line of credit are not sufficient  or if an event of default occurs  such as failure to achieve certain financial covenants  that limits our ability to borrow under the line of credit  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
additional equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders 
if additional financing is needed and is not available on acceptable terms  we may need to reduce our operating expenses and scale back our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us
