operations we are one of the largest steel producers in the united states based on an estimated annual steelmaking capability of million tons  with shipments from steel operations  including galvanizing  totaling million tons 
we plan to increase our annual steelmaking capacity to million tons by the end of pursuant to our acquisition of omnisource corporation in october  we are also now one of north america s largest scrap recycling companies 
our total consolidated shipments  which exclude shipments between our operating divisions  totaled million tons 
steel operations 
steel operations include our flat roll division  structural and rail division  engineered bar products division  roanoke bar division  steel of west virginia swva and the techs operations 
these operations consist of mini mills  producing steel from steel scrap  using electric arc furnaces  continuous casting  automated rolling mills  and downstream finishing facilities 
steel operations accounted for  and of the company s consolidated net sales during  and  respectively 
the flat roll division accounted for  and of our consolidated net sales during  and  respectively 
this decreased concentration in steel operations and flat rolled products reflects our continued growth and escalating product diversification 
our flat roll division sells a broad range of hot rolled  cold rolled and coated steel products  including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled  galvanized  galvalume and painted products 
our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premium grade rail for the railroad industry 
our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and round cornered squares 
our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products  including angles  plain rounds  flats and channels 
swva primarily sells merchant beams  channels and specialty structural steel sections 
the techs was acquired in july and operates three galvanizing lines specializing in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in non automotive applications 
our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers 
these products are used in numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
fabrication operations 
fabrication operations include our five new millennium building systems plants located in butler  indiana  lake city  florida  salem  virginia  florence  south carolina  and continental  ohio 
revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses  girders  steel joists and steel decking used within the non residential construction industry 
fabrication operations accounted for  and of our consolidated net sales during  and  respectively 
steel scrap and scrap substitute operations 
steel scrap and scrap substitute operations include the revenues and expenses associated with our existing steel scrap processing locations and those related to our october  acquisition of omnisource 
in addition our iron dynamics idi facility is included in this segment 
output from these operations is generally used as raw materials within our steel operations 
steel scrap and scrap substitute operations accounted for of our consolidated net sales during acquisitions omnisource 
on october   we completed our acquisition of omnisource  one of north america s largest scrap recycling companies 
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of omnisource in a transaction valued at approximately billion  including million in cash  million shares of steel dynamics common stock valued at approximately million  and the assumption of approximately million of debt  which was repaid at closing 
we have in the past  and will continue in the future  to purchase a portion of our raw material needs for the steel operations segment from omnisource 
we purchased omnisource to significantly expand our strategic expansion into the steel scrap and recycled metals sector 
omnisource primarily procures and processes an array of ferrous and non ferrous scrap materials and also provides brokerage and materials management services for these materials 
aside from the fact that scrap is the single largest cost component for our steelmaking operations  the acquisition provides an entry for further profitable growth in a sector that is continuing to grow on a global basis 
omnisource employs over  people in facilities located in the eastern united states and canada 
omnisource will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of steel dynamics and will continue to focus on the ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing  brokerage  and industrial scrap management needs of its customers 
omnisource operations are reported in our steel scrap and scrap substitute operating segment 
omnisource operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger  october   through december  the techs 
on july   we purchased the techs for approximately million  which was funded from our existing senior secured revolving credit facility 
the techs is a pennsylvania based flat rolled steel galvanizing company  which consists of three non union galvanizing facilities galvtech  metaltech  and nextech 
each facility specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in non automotive applications  servicing a variety of customers in the hvac  commercial construction  and consumer goods markets 
about of the techs sales are to customers in the eastern us and the midwest 
in  the privately held company shipped  tons of galvanized steel and generated revenues of million 
we purchased the techs to expand our market share in the value added steel coating business 
with the addition of the techs  we have an annual estimated galvanizing capacity of approximately million tons 
the techs complements our three existing galvanizing lines located in butler  indiana and jeffersonville  indiana 
the purchase of the techs allows us to access markets that require widths or gauges that our existing facilities can not currently supply 
the techs operations are reflected in our steel operations segment 
the techs operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger july   through december  income statement classifications net sales 
net sales from our operations are a factor of net tons shipped  product mix and related pricing 
except for our fabrication operations  we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer 
net sales from steel fabrication are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 
steel fabrication revenues accounted for approximately of our total net sales during both and we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  product dimensions  or certain smaller volumes  and for value added processing or coating of steel products 
costs of goods sold 
our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs for our steel operations are steel scrap and scrap substitutes  alloys  zinc  natural gas  argon  direct and indirect labor and related benefits  electricity  oxygen  electrodes  depreciation  materials and freight 
our metallic raw materials  steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant component of our costs of goods sold 
the primary costs related to our steel scrap and scrap substitute operations is the cost of materials  freight costs and processing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  and administrative departments 
these costs include labor and benefits  professional services  financing cost amortization  property taxes  and profit sharing expense 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt described in the notes to our financial statements net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of material capital projects 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other non operating income activity  including gains on certain short term investments and income from equity investments 
other expense consists of any non operating costs 
operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted share during  compared with million or per diluted share during our gross margin percentage was and during and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage during was due to several factors  primarily weaker flat roll steel markets and the acquisition of the techs and omnisource 
although the techs generally elicits higher selling values due to value added products  the gross margin for the galvanized steels produced by the techs is lower than that of our other galvanizing lines due to the incremental cost of purchasing a steel coil to be coated versus producing that coil at cost  as we do at our flat roll division 
omnisource is primarily engaged in the collection and processing of ferrous and non ferrous materials for resale to steel producers  brokers  and other processors 
this type of business operates at lower margins than we have historically experienced as a steel producer 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased billion  or  to billion  while our consolidated shipments increased million tons  or  to million tons  when compared with the increase in shipments was due to increased shipments at several of our steelmaking operations and to shipments from our acquired operations the techs and omnisource 
steel operations flat roll division    structural and rail division    engineered bar products division    roanoke bar division   steel of west virginia   the techs  total shipments tons    steel operations accounted for  and or our consolidated net sales and  and of our consolidated gross margin during   and  respectively 
our flat roll division decreased shipments by  tons  or 
our structural and rail division increased shipments by  tons  or  which resulted from increased demand for structural products for the non residential construction industry 
our engineered bar products division increased shipments by  tons  or  during this period as a result of increased demand for special bar quality products and the continued development of longer term customer supply relationships 
in our roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia shipped  tons and  tons respectively for the full year compared to  tons and  tons respectively for the period april  to december  average quarterly steel selling prices logo our average steel operations selling price per ton shipped increased compared with during strong demand for structural steel products allowed us to increase our annual average selling price by more than  while the inverse was true for our flat roll products 
due to weaker demand during and the overhang of inventories from the impact of lower priced inventory during the third and fourth quarters of  our annual average selling price for flat roll products decreased by more than 
however  throughout the second half of  steel service center inventories continued to decline and were at a two year low by the end of the year 
due in part to supply constraints that have arisen from lower import levels and shuttered or in repair domestic manufacturing facilities  in addition to increased demand from the service centers  we have seen a recovery in our flat rolled order pricing during the first quarter of we currently anticipate an increase in our steel operations average pricing when comparing to the fourth quarter of metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost 
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased during as compared to during and our metallic raw material costs represented and of our steel operation s manufacturing costs and and of our total consolidated manufacturing costs 
we are experiencing an increase in steel scrap prices during the first quarter of  which  when coupled with our anticipated increase in average product pricing would result in stable to increasing margins when compared to the fourth quarter of steel fabrication operations fabrication operations accounted for  and of our consolidated net sales during   and  respectively 
during april  we purchased three additional joist manufacturing facilities 
we have renovated these facilities during and and anticipate increased production during our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped increased  or  during when compared with the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our fabrication operations 
during and  respectively  the cost of steel products purchased represented and or the total cost of manufacturing for our fabrication operations 
average quarterly fabrication selling prices logo steel scrap and scrap substitute operations steel scrap and scrap substitute operations accounted for of our consolidated net sales and of our consolidated gross margin during our steel scrap operations primarily engage in the collection and processing of ferrous and non ferrous metals for resale to steel companies  brokers and other metals processors 
during  approximately of the sales from these operations were to our steel mills 
we expect this percentage to increase somewhat during consolidated results vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
our selling  general and administrative expenses represented of our total net sales during both and during  we incurred an expense of million related to the write off of previously capitalized financing costs when we redeemed our million senior notes due notes 
we recorded expense of million and million during and  respectively  related to our steel dynamics performance based profit sharing plan allocation which is currently calculated as of pretax earnings 
during and  respectively  we recorded additional profit sharing expense of million and million  related to certain subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan 
our board of directors approved an increase from to the current in the profit sharing rate effective august   in recognition of the additional plan participants added as a result of acquisition activity 
interest expense 
during  gross interest expense increased million  or  to million and capitalized interest increased million to million  when compared to the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our steel operations and fabrication operations 
during  interest expense was also reduced by million related to the recognition of the remaining unamortized bond premium associated with the redemption of our notes 
we currently anticipate gross interest expense to increase for  as we have additional outstanding borrowings related to our recent acquisition of omnisource  which was principally financed with the issuance of the million senior notes due other income expense 
other expense was million during  as compared to other income of million during during  other expense was principally comprised of million of additional expense related to the call premium associated with the redemption of our notes and the termination of a related fixed to floating interest rate swap which resulted in a million loss on hedging activities 
these expenses were partially offset by interest income  certain non operating revenues  and income from certain equity investments 
during  other income was principally comprised of certain non operating revenues recognized at several of the roanoke electric subsidiaries 
income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate was and during and  respectively 
we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  the implementation of fin did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december  are potential benefits of million that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net of tax basis in income tax expense 
during  we recognized interest of million  net of tax  and penalties of million 
at december   we had million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions 
the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for through in the third quarter of the final examination adjustments did not result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations 
we are currently under examination by the state of indiana for calendar years through it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of this audit or other state income tax audits 
based on the current audits in process  the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to million by the end of  primarily related to the deductibility of intercompany royalty and related interest payments 
with few exceptions  and as noted for the state of indiana  the company is no longer subject to federal  state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted share during  compared with million or per diluted share during our gross margin percentage was and during and  respectively 
our average consolidated selling price per ton shipped increased  or  when compared to  while at the same time costs associated with our metallic raw materials on a comparative basis increased only per net ton consumed 
these circumstances resulted in increased gross margin 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased billion  or  to billion  while our consolidated shipments increased million tons  or  to million tons  when compared with the increase in shipments was due to increased shipments at each of our three steelmaking operations and the inclusion of shipments from our roanoke electric operations from the effective date of the merger april  through the end of the year 
our flat roll division increased shipments by  tons  or 
our structural and rail division increased shipments by  tons  or  which resulted from increased demand for structural products for the non residential construction industry 
our engineered bar products division increased shipments by  tons  or  during this period as a result of increased demand for special bar quality products and the continued development of longer term customer supply relationships 
during  the engineered bar products division constructed and commenced operations of an on site finishing facility which has enhanced margins 
the finishing facility began limited operations during the second quarter of and became fully operational during the third quarter 
also included in our shipments are volumes from our newly acquired roanoke electric steelmaking operations of  tons from our roanoke bar division and  tons from our steel of west virginia operations 
our average consolidated selling price per ton shipped increased compared with during the third quarter of  inventories increased at steel service centers and prices softened for certain flat rolled products as a consequence 
during  the volume of steel products imported into the united states increased  driven by strong demand and short term supply constraints for certain products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
our selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of our total net sales during and  respectively 
we recorded expense of million and million during and  respectively  related to our steel dynamics performance based profit sharing plan allocation which is currently calculated as of pretax earnings 
during  we recorded additional profit sharing expense of million  related to certain roanoke electric and other subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan until august  our board of directors approved an increase from to the current in the profit sharing rate effective august   in recognition of the additional plan participants added as a result of the roanoke electric merger 
we adopted fas r on january   which requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity based instruments in the financial statements 
during  we recorded million of equity based compensation expense related to our outstanding incentive stock options 
interest expense 
during  gross interest expense decreased million  or  to million and capitalized interest increased  to million  when compared to the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our engineered bar products and structural and rail divisions 
other income expense 
other income was million during  as compared to million during during  other income was principally composed of certain non operating revenues recognized at several of the roanoke electric subsidiaries 
during other income was principally from the sale of certain equity securities held as short term investments 

income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate was and during and  respectively 
during the second quarter of  we decreased our estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect  among other things  the recognition of research and development tax credits and the reduction in our expected state tax rate due to the roanoke electric merger 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity  long term borrowings  state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 
working capital 
during  our operational working capital position  representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased million to billion compared to december  approximately million of working capital was associated with the acquisition of omnisource 
trade receivables increased million  or  during to million  of which more than  were current or less than days past due 
our largest customer is an affiliated company  heidtman steel  which represented and of our outstanding trade receivables at december  and  respectively 
during  our inventories increased million  or  to million 
the addition of the techs and omnisource accounted for million and million of these increases  respectively 
our trade payables and general accruals increased million  or  during capital expenditures 
during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  of which slightly more than was related to the continued construction of a second rolling mill and caster at our structural and rail division and the continued reconfiguration of the three acquired roanoke electric joist plants 
the remaining capital expenditures represented improvement projects at our existing facilities  including increased capabilities to produce pre painted steel  acrylic coated steel and galvalume coated steel at jeffersonville 
we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops 
capital resources and long term debt 
during  our total outstanding debt  including unamortized bond premium  increased billion to billion 
during  holders of our convertible subordinated notes converted  of the notes to steel dynamics common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares from our treasury reserves 
there are currently  shares still available for conversion pursuant to these notes 
our long term debt to capitalization ratio  representing our total debt divided by the sum of our total debt and our total stockholders equity  was and at december  and  respectively 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under our million senior secured revolver and million outstanding under our term a loan 
the senior secured credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and inter company debt held by us and each of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 
common stock purchases 
from time to time  our board of directors authorizes management to repurchase shares of steel dynamics common stock through open market trades 
we repurchased million shares for million during  million shares for million during  and million shares for million during as of december   we had remaining authorization in place from our board of directors to repurchase approximately million additional shares 
the repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
cash dividends 
we declared cash dividends of million  or 
per share  during  million  or 
per share  during  and million  or 
per share  during we paid cash dividends of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
we anticipate continuing quarterly cash dividends throughout the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors  after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  outstanding indebtedness  current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indenture relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
other 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  funding working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures  and any additional funding as may be required in equity based investments pursuant to certain put rights 
during  we currently anticipate spending approximately million on capital improvement projects at our existing facilities and on  among others  the following capital projects approximately million in connection with the addition of a second rolling mill at our structural and rail division  related to the mesabi nugget project  million in connection with various scrap processing projects  million in connection with certain upgrades at our engineered bar products division and million of various smaller individual projects at our existing operations 
these amounts do not include capital requirements that may arise from our involvement in new joint ventures or merger and acquisition activity that may occur throughout the year 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and incentive credits  and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million  million    and  during the years through  respectively 
contractual obligations and other long term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
based on this definition  the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt     estimated interest payments on debt   purchase obligations     construction commitments   lease commitments      other commitments      total      the long term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes and our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding until maturity 
the earliest date at which redemption or repurchase may occur for our million convertible subordinated notes was december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our long term debt 
the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of on our million senior unsecured notes due october  on our million senior unsecured notes due april  on our million convertible subordinated notes due december   on our outstanding senior secured revolver and term a balances  and on our other fixed rate debt of approximately million 
purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process 
these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions 
we have fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december  other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 
other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
during  we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately million 
over of the costs incurred during for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements 
we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately  at all of our facilities during we have an accrual of  recorded as a contingency for environmental remediation related to our omnisource subsidiary 
we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments in note to our consolidated financial statements  we discuss new accounting policies adopted by steel dynamics during and the expected financial impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our fabrication operations recognize revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract 
fabrication operations accounted for of our net sales 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
inventories 
we record inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally on a first in  first out  basis which approximates fair market values 
impairments of long lived tangible and finite lived intangible assets 
in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as required by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is allocated to various reporting units  which are generally one level below our operating segments 
to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we generally use discounted cash flow models and multiples of earnings before interest expense  amortization  depreciation and taxes as measurements of fair value 
based on our valuations  there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets at december  or during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in thousands interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate principal average rate principal average rate expected maturity date thereafter  total   fair value   commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas and alloys 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities
