item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form k  other filings with the securities and exchange commission  and in any other discussions of the company s business 
the following information should be read in conjunction with item  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect the company s business  financial condition  or future results 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also adversely affect the business  financial condition  and or operating results of the company 
the continued worsening of the us economy has and can be expected to have a material negative impact on consumer purchases of discretionary items  which can be expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on the company s level of sales and profitability 
many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industry  including general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  employment levels  political conditions such as war  terrorism and political unrest  consumer confidence in future economic conditions  real estate market  and increasing energy prices 
the us economy is currently experiencing significant and worsening macro economic issues  including tightening of us credit markets  residential real estate crisis  recessionary and inflationary pressures  high energy prices  declining value of the us dollar  higher unemployment rates  and stock market declines  which the company believes has negatively impacted its business and will continue to do so in the future 
the company believes that consumer purchases of discretionary items have declined and may continue to decline during periods of a negative economic environment and other periods where disposable income is lower 
a continued downturn in the economies in which the company sells its products  whether in the us or abroad  may adversely affect the company s level of sales  results of operations  and the potential willingness of lenders to increase or provide financing 

table of contents the company expects to purchase a substantial part of its merchandise inventory going forward through open account purchase terms from its vendors  without the use of letter of credit facilities  which in the past have been used for these purchases 
in connection with the continued tightening of the us credit and lending markets  the company s banks providing its letter of credit facilities  which historically have been used by the company for its merchandise purchases from foreign vendors  have not renewed or extended those facilities and the letter of credit facilities gradually reduce to zero during however  the company has successfully negotiated open account terms  with improved payment terms  with those vendors that currently represent the majority of the company s merchandise purchases  and the company may pursue open account terms with other merchandise vendors as well 
these open account payment terms do not require letters of credit and are expected to largely offset the reduction and elimination of the letter of credit facilities 
the negotiated new vendor payment terms are also expected to favorably impact cash flow 
the company is also pursuing new letter of credit arrangements with other lenders to utilize for certain inventory purchases  particularly for smaller merchandise vendors 
the company will continue to use the remaining balance of its letter of credit facility up to august   when it is reduced to zero  while it pursues a replacement letter of credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain new letter of credit facilities to cover merchandise purchases if and when needed or that the company will at all times be able to purchase all of its merchandise inventory through open account payment terms with merchandise vendors 
the company s capital resources required to fund its working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service and operations are dependent upon cash flows from operations  cash on hand  credit extended from merchandise vendors  and availability under its credit facilities  and these cash resources may be negatively impacted by many factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities  cash on hand  and short term line of credit facilities 
the company currently anticipates that cash flows from operations  cash on hand  and borrowings available under its short term credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
however  such sufficiency is dependent upon and may be adversely impacted by many factors  including achieving the company s sales plan for the year  achieving the company s operating cash flow plan for the year  particularly during merchandise inventory build ups in advance of the principal selling seasons  continuation of merchandise purchases on open account purchase terms from merchandise vendors at expected levels  replacement of the company s letter of credit facilities at levels sufficient to purchase adequate merchandise inventory from any vendors who require letters of credit for merchandise purchases  the company s ability to obtain any necessary increases in its line of credit facilities if needed to fund operating plans  the company s ability to reduce any cash spending in the amounts and at the times needed if borrowings available  cash on hand  and available credit are not sufficient to fund existing operating plans  merchandise purchases  planned capital expenditures and strategic initiatives  successfully executing the company s strategic initiatives  including anticipated lower inventory levels and timing  expected operating expense reductions and other cost reductions  the success of the new promotional cadence for the talbots brand  reduced markdown exposure and improved gross margins  the successful closing of the talbots kids and talbots mens business concepts  and the closing of other announced underperforming stores  including all stores within the united kingdom  the impact of the continued deterioration in the economic environment  including continued negative impact on us consumer discretionary spending  current residential real estate downturn  the disruption and 
table of contents significant tightening in the us credit markets  recessionary and inflationary pressures  high energy prices  declining value of the us dollar  higher unemployment rates and stock market declines  and the company s ability to continue to satisfy its financial covenants under its existing debt agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity needs or that the company will be able to obtain additional financing or other capital resource alternatives to fund its cash needs in the amounts or at the times needed 
in the event the company is unable to increase its borrowing availability under its credit facilities in the amounts and times needed  the company would expect to explore other capital or financing sources or reduce spending 
there can be no assurance that any such other capital or financing sources would be available in the amounts or in the time periods needed 
the successful and timely execution of the company s strategic plan is critical to the company s short term and long term profitability 
in october  the company announced that it had initiated a comprehensive strategic review of its business and engaged a leading global consulting firm to assist management in developing a strategic plan 
this review included the following areas brand positioning  productivity  store growth and store productivity  non core concepts  distribution channels  the j 
jill brand  and other operating matters 
the consulting firm completed its review in the first quarter of  from which the company developed a three year strategic plan 
the company has announced a number of strategic initiatives in order to achieve its goal of achieving profitability and long term shareholder value 
these initiatives include exiting the talbots kids and talbots mens business concepts  revamping the marketing strategy including the promotional cadence for the talbots brand  and developing a comprehensive plan to reduce the company s cost structure and operating expenses  among other initiatives 
successful implementation of these initiatives is critical to the company s short term and long term success and profitability 
the company cannot assure that the strategic and other operating initiatives being implemented as part of its revitalization plan will favorably impact the company s operations or will be successfully executed or executed in the time period projected 
any failure to successfully and timely implement these initiatives can be expected to negatively impact the company s operating results and profitability 
in the event that the company is at any time required to reduce its cash spending  whether as a result of insufficient available credit or otherwise  the company may need to reduce or delay cash spending on one or more of its strategic initiatives  which could be expected to reduce or delay the positive benefits which the company believes will result from these initiatives as part of its turnaround plans 
the success of the business depends on the company s ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demands 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to originate and define fashion product trends  as well as to anticipate  gauge  and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner 
the retail business fluctuates according to consumer preferences  dictated in part by fashion and season 
decisions with respect to product designs are generally made well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases 
in addition  both brands are undergoing significant personnel and operational changes to their merchandising areas 
as a result  the company is particularly vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and is less able to respond to customer demands or trends rapidly 
to the extent the company fails to anticipate  identify  and respond effectively to consumer preferences  or to successfully integrate new personnel and operational changes  sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company incurred substantial debt to finance the j 
jill acquisition 
the company s business may not generate significant cash flow to meet these obligations and the debt agreement restrictions may limit the company s activities 
in february  the company entered into a million bridge loan agreement in connection with its planned acquisition of j 
jill 
in july  the bridge loan was converted into a term loan the acquisition debt to 
table of contents be repaid in equal quarterly installments over a five year period 
additionally  since the acquisition  borrowings under the company s short term facilities have been higher than it has historically experienced in order to meet current cash needs 
the company s ability at all times to satisfy its obligations and to reduce its total debt depends on the company s future operating performance 
the company s business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations 
if the company is unable to service its debt and fund its business  the company may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  or seek additional financing or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the company s cash requirements will at all times be met by existing available borrowing facilities 
additionally  a majority of the company s outstanding debt accrues interest at variable rates  therefore  interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
the company s acquisition debt agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit the company s ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit it  including restrictions on the company s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  make investments  create liens  sell assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate  or merge 
although the company has increased its borrowing capacity under its short term line of credit facilities and expects to seek additional increased availability in the future  the company s ability to borrow under these facilities can be limited by the financial covenants in the company s acquisition debt agreement  including the leverage ratio which is impacted by total borrowings 
the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of its acquisition debt agreement 
the company s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on its future performance 
in addition  any failure by the company to meet its sales plan at the talbots brand or j 
jill brand at any time will cause reduced levels of sales and likely increase markdowns and clearance of unsold merchandise  which could negatively impact gross margin  profitability  and the company s ability to meet its financial covenants 
the company s failure to comply with its restrictions or covenants would result in an event of default under its acquisition debt agreement  which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument as well as accelerate any other indebtedness under its other existing or subsequent credit facilities 
this would require the company to repay all of the debt before its scheduled due dates 
if an event of default occurs  the company may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under its indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that the company will satisfy its financial covenants and other covenants as of each determination date 
if the company determines that it is likely that it will not satisfy any of these financial or other covenants  either as a result of our actual or expected operating results or borrowing needs or otherwise  the company would expect to seek a waiver or an amendment of such covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in obtaining any such waiver or amendment 
the company may not be able to maintain proper inventory levels 
customer demand is difficult to predict since the design process begins well in advance of the date the products are to be sold 
the company must anticipate trends and customer demand well ahead of time in order to accurately maintain inventory levels 
this lag in lead time makes responding to changes quickly difficult and any misjudgments in customer preferences can be detrimental to earnings as well as customer satisfaction 
in addition  the company is taking significant steps to improve inventory management by managing leaner inventories  changing its markdown cadence  and the implementation of a price optimizing software tool 
the company cannot provide assurance that these steps will be successfully implemented 
moreover  inventory levels in excess of customer demand could result in inventory markdowns or movement of the inventory to the company s outlet facilities to be sold at discount or closeout prices which could negatively impact operating results and impair 
table of contents the company s brand image 
in contrast to that scenario  if the company underestimates customer demand or for any other reason fails to supply adequate levels of quality products in a timely manner  the company could experience inventory shortages resulting in missed sales opportunities  negative impact on customer loyalty and loss of revenues 
the inability to fill customer orders efficiently could lower customer satisfaction and could cause customers to go to an alternate source for the desired products 
this lowered level of customer satisfaction and improper inventory levels could adversely affect the company s operations 
the retail apparel industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with national department stores as well as regional department store chains 
the company also competes with other specialty retailers and catalog companies 
the company is faced with a variety of competitive challenges including anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition  developing high quality merchandise in sizes  colors  and styles that appeal to consumers  appropriately managing inventory levels  sourcing merchandise efficiently  effectively marketing the company s products to consumers  and pricing the company s merchandise appropriately 
increased competition could cause the company s sales and margins to be reduced and adversely affect results of operations 
the company may not be able to successfully reposition j 
jill s operations 
the company acquired j 
jill in may j 
jill sales have not been at the levels that the company originally anticipated and therefore the company was required to record an impairment charge of million on the acquired goodwill and trademark 
the company s ability to continue to grow and sustain long term profitability may depend upon effectively improving the operating performance and growing the j 
jill business 
the realization of revenue growth  additional cost savings or synergies related to j 
jill will depend largely upon the company s ability to implement key design changes to the j 
jill brand merchandise that will lead to increased sales  appropriately price the j 
jill brand merchandise  open j 
jill brand stores in locations where operations will be profitable  and refine and unify the j 
jill brand s marketing and promotional programs 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully execute any of the actions above or that the company s strategies for the j 
jill brand will achieve the results necessary to generate profits 
if the company fails to improve the j 
jill operations or cannot successfully execute its growth strategy  the company s results will be adversely impacted and future impairment charges may be recognized 
the company cannot assure that its change in growth strategy will result in improved profitability 
the company has adjusted its strategy to build on five key growth platforms talbots woman  talbots accessories shoes  talbots collection  j 
jill brand  and penetration into premium level outlets  rather than continuing to open new stores at its historical levels 
the company is also committed to regularly assessing the portfolio of its brand stores for profitability and to closing underperforming stores when appropriate 
in the company expects to close approximately underperforming stores  including all remaining stores associated with the talbots kids and talbots mens business concepts and all three stores within the united kingdom 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in negotiating settlements with the respective landlords and that the cost will not exceed the anticipated amounts 
additionally  during  the company plans to open approximately talbots brand stores and j 
jill brand stores  which is fewer stores than the company s planned expansion is dependent upon a number of factors  including general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending  the 
table of contents level of sales volume and profitability at existing store locations  the availability of sufficient capital resources to support expansion plans  the continuing availability of desirable locations  the ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms for prospective new and expanded locations  sourcing sufficient levels of inventory  hiring and training qualified management level and other associates  and integrating new stores into its existing operations 
there is no assurance that the company s changed growth strategy will lead to improved operating results 
there also can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned growth strategy or that such growth will be profitable or that the company will be able to manage its growth effectively 
talented personnel are critical to the company s success 
the company cannot assure that the current management team or the additions to the company s executive leadership team will result in increased profitability for the company 
the company s success and ability to properly manage its growth depends to a significant extent on both the performance of its current executive and senior management team and its ability to attract  hire  motivate  and retain qualified and talented management personnel in the future 
during and early  the company hired a number of new key senior executives in the areas of brand leadership  creative  merchandising  marketing  and merchandise inventory planning and allocation 
there can be no assurance that the new key hires will be successful in achieving better sales and other operating results or long term profitability for the company 
additionally  the company s inability to retain these personnel  or the loss of service of any other key employees  would likely adversely impact the company s operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in comparable store sales results 
comparable stores are those that were open for at least one full fiscal year 
when a new talbots petites store  talbots woman store  or talbots accessories shoes store is opened adjacent to or in close proximity to an existing comparable misses store  such misses store is excluded from the computation of comparable store sales for a period of months so that the performance of the full misses assortment may be properly compared 
the company s comparable store sales results have fluctuated in the past on a monthly  quarterly  and annual basis  and are expected to fluctuate in the future 
a variety of factors affect comparable store sales results  including changes in fashion trends  timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events  changes in the company s merchandise mix  timing of catalog mailings  calendar shifts of holiday periods  actions by competitors  weather conditions  and general economic conditions 
past comparable store sales are not an indicator of future results  and there can be no assurance that the company s comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 
the company s comparable store sales performance is likely to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in operating results 
the company s annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
among the factors that may cause the company s operating results to fluctuate are customers response to merchandise offerings  the timing of the rollout of new stores  closing existing stores and concepts  seasonal variations in sales  the timing and size of catalog mailings  the costs of producing and mailing catalogs  the timing of merchandise receipts  the level of merchandise returns  changes in merchandise mix and presentation  the company s cost of merchandise  unanticipated operating costs  and other factors beyond the company s control  such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors 
as a result of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
in addition  similar to all specialty retailers  the company can be expected to face the impact of the continued deterioration in the economic environment  including continued negative impact on us consumer discretionary spending  current residential real estate downturn  the disruption and significant tightening in the us credit markets  recessionary and inflationary pressures  high energy prices  declining value of the us dollar  higher unemployment rates and stock market declines 
if the company fails to maintain the value of its brands  sales are likely to decline 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to effectively define  evolve  and promote its brands 
the talbots brand name and classic niche as well as the j 
jill brand name and sophisticated casual niche is integral 
table of contents to the success of the brand s businesses 
maintaining  promoting  and positioning the company s brands will depend largely on the success of the brand s design  merchandising  and marketing efforts and the ability to provide a consistent  high quality customer experience 
additionally  the company may need to increase investments in the development of the brands through various means  including customer research  increased prospecting  advertising and promotional events  direct mail and internet marketing 
while the company believes that its objectives will help to build brand awareness and attract new customers  the company cannot provide assurance that they will result in increased sales or profitability 
additionally  the company s brands could be adversely affected if the company s public image is tarnished by negative sales or poor operating performance 
the company cannot assure that internet sales will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth 
the company sells merchandise over the internet through its websites  www 
talbots 
com and www 
jjill 
com 
the company s internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures  and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
the internet operations also involve other risks that could have an impact on the company s results of operations  including potential electronic break ins or other security breaches  hiring  retention and training of personnel to conduct the company s internet operations  diversion of sales from the company s stores  rapid technological change  liability for online content  credit card fraud  violations of state or federal privacy laws  and risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures and similar disruptions 
the many risks associated with internet sales could cause a decline in consumer confidence which could reduce internet sales 
there can be no assurance that the company s internet operations will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth or even remain at their current level 
the company could be adversely affected if any of its distribution centers are shut down 
the company operates store distribution and catalog fulfillment facilities in lakeville  massachusetts  and tilton  new hampshire for all of its us stores and worldwide catalog operations 
if one center were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason  the other center may not be able to adequately support the resulting additional distribution and fulfillment demands  in part because of capacity constraints and in part because each center services a particular brand 
as a result  the company could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing merchandise to its stores and or fulfill catalog and internet orders  which could have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s overseas merchandise purchasing strategy makes it vulnerable to a number of risks 
the company purchases a significant portion of its merchandise directly from foreign sources 
approximately of the talbots brand merchandise and of the j 
jill brand merchandise purchased in was purchased directly from foreign sources 
in addition  goods purchased from domestic vendors may be sourced abroad by such vendors 
as a result  the company s business remains subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as political instability  imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods that may be imported into the us from countries in a region where the company does business  imposition of duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  natural disasters and public health concerns  potential delays or disruption in shipping and related pricing impacts  and local business practices and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards 
the company cannot predict whether the foreign countries in which the company s apparel and accessories are currently manufactured or any of the foreign countries in which the company s apparel and accessories may be manufactured in the future will be subject to import restrictions by the us government  including the likelihood  type or effect of any trade retaliation 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or more restrictive quotas  
table of contents applicable to apparel items could affect the importation of apparel and  in that event  could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to the company and adversely affect the company s operations 
the company relies on third party manufacturers for its merchandise  including many foreign sources of merchandise 
the company has an extensive  formal program requiring all of its manufacturers to comply with applicable labor laws and acceptable labor practices 
any failure to comply with applicable labor laws and practices by any of these manufacturers could materially harm the company s reputation with its customers as well as disrupt the supply of merchandise to the company 
a major failure of the company s information systems could harm the business 
the company depends on information systems to manage its operations 
the company s information systems consist of a full range of retail  financial  and merchandising systems  including credit  inventory distribution and control  sales reporting  accounts payable  budgeting and forecasting  financial reporting  merchandise reporting  and distribution 
the company regularly makes investments to upgrade  enhance  or replace such systems 
any delays or difficulties in transitioning to these new systems  or in integrating these systems with the company s current systems  or any other disruptions affecting the company s information systems  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has experienced significant variability between its expectations and outlook for sales and profitability and its actual results 
over the past two years the company has experienced significant differences between its internal expectations and publicly announced outlook for sales and profitability and our actual reported results 
this variability has resulted in significant fluctuation and volatility in the market price of its common stock 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or future internal expectations and outlook for sales  comparable sales  gross margin and profitability will prove to be accurate 
the market price of the company s common stock is volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly 
future announcements or disclosures concerning the company or its competitors  sales and profitability results  quarterly variations in operating results or comparable store net sales  changes in earnings estimates by the company or by analysts  among other factors  could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets  in general  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
greater level of returns than anticipated could adversely affect the company s operations 
as part of the company s commitment to its customer  it maintains a liberal merchandise return policy that offers an unconditional guarantee of satisfaction by allowing customers to return any product for any reason with no time limit 
the company makes allowances in its consolidated financial statements based on historical return rates but these expectations may be exceeded by actual returns 
any significant increase in returns could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will continue to pay dividends 
the payment of dividends and the amount of any dividend is determined by the company s board of directors 
the board considers many factors in making decision on dividends  including its earnings  operations  financial condition  capital and other cash requirements  and general business outlook 
in the light of the current macro economic environment and the company s outlook and future results  there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid at the same or lower rate  or at all  in the future 
if the company lowers its dividend rate or does not pay dividends  the price of its common stock must appreciate for shareholders to receive a gain on their investment in the company 
this appreciation may not occur 
the foregoing list of risk factors is not intended to be exhaustive

management currently is initiating steps with the objective of improving the j 
jill brand s sales productivity measured by metrics such as sales per square foot  sales per catalog page  etc 
this improvement  if achieved  would result in a decrease in selling  general  and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales compared to current results 
however  management is not able

the company is taking steps designed to improve its performance in and beyond 
the future success of the company s brands and improvements in its sales and operating performance for and beyond is substantially dependent upon the achievement of the above initiatives to improve comparable store sales results  including the level of full price versus markdown selling  and to reduce the company s current cost 
table of contents structure 
in addition  the company s performance will depend on management s ability to anticipate and successfully respond to changing customer tastes and fashion preferences and customer acceptance of each brand s seasonal fashion offerings 
decisions with respect to product designs are generally made well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion acceptance is evidenced by customer purchases 
to the extent that the company fails to anticipate  identify  and respond effectively to consumer preferences  sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect the company s results 
sales at the talbots brand to date in have been less than planned  although significantly improved gross margin has largely offset this sales shortfall  primarily as a result of the brand s new promotional markdown cadence

this represents an increase of approximately in gross and selling square footage from january   when the company operated  stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
secondly  reflected in retail stores sales was a million  or  increase in comparable stores sales 
comparable store sales were strong during the april to september period  these months representing a combined increase over the prior year  offset by declines in the other months 
management believes that comparable store sales were primarily driven by the brand s improved classic merchandise offering during the period  as well as certain key initiatives put into place during the third quarter  such as offering its customer more choices and diversity by increasing style count  sharpening price points across virtually all categories of merchandise  and responding to the customers buying patterns and adjusting the company s marketing and promotional calendar 
due to the success of the early fall season  the company anticipated continued strong sales trends for the fourth quarter and therefore increased inventory purchases 
the fourth quarter sales trends were lower than anticipated leading to higher levels of markdown merchandise and deeper discounts during the fourth quarter 
additionally  management believes that the timing of promotions  underperforming catalogs  as well as adverse weather conditions in key markets led to decreased customer traffic and declines in comparable store sales in february and march of j 
jill brand retail stores as of february   the company operated j 
jill brand retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million and million  respectively

the j 
jill brand s retail store sales reflected a decline in comparable store sales since the date of acquisition compared to the same period of the prior year  which management believes was a continuation of sales trends resulting from strategies put in place prior to the acquisition 
specifically  management believes that comparable store sales were influenced by a weak top line performance of merchandise that was not brand appropriate  which negatively impacted regular and markdown selling for the brand 
additionally  management believes that a number of significant shifts in the promotional calendar  as well as the reduction in catalog circulation during the period  led to decreased customer traffic and spending resulting in lower than expected retail sales for the brand 
the company has seen a sequential quarterly improvement during in comparable store sales performance since the date of acquisition  with the fourth quarter yielding positive comparable store sales results

the increased markdown selling was attributable to both the planned increased inventory levels for the second quarter sales event and the clearing of excess inventory from the fall season 
additionally  a basis point deterioration was driven by higher occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales incurred across both brands 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in  which included results for the talbots brand for the entire year and the j 
jill brand from the date of acquisition  compared to in  which included results for the talbots brand only 
this represented a basis point deterioration in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales over the prior year  with acquisition related costs incurred during the period accounting for approximately basis points of the increase 
also contributing to the increase was higher j 
jill brand incurred costs as a percentage of net sales in comparison to the talbots brand  especially in the area of catalog production costs  which accounted for approximately basis points of the increase 
additionally  stock based compensation expense recorded as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and provided pro forma disclosures applying the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 to stock based awards 
for  the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r was a decrease to income before income taxes of million and a decrease to net income of million  or per diluted common share 
the company elected to use the modified prospective application method as its transition method under sfas no 
r 
therefore  prior periods were not restated 
under this transition method  the company is recognizing stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards for those awards granted following the adoption of sfas no 
r 
for unvested awards outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company is recognizing stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the remaining requisite service period of the awards 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of the award that is expected to vest 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for  forfeitures were recognized as incurred for purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under sfas no 
had the company recognized compensation expense under the fair value method during  such expense would have decreased net income before income taxes by million and net income by million  or per diluted common share 
net interest expense net interest expense in increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to increased levels of borrowings in compared to the same period of the average level of debt outstanding including short term and long term borrowings was million in compared to in in february  the company borrowed million of debt under a short term facility in connection with the acquisition of j 
jill 
the interest cost associated with this debt was largely offset by the earnings on the invested cash until may   when the borrowed funds were used to acquire j 
jill 
on july   the short term facility was converted into a five year term loan  bearing interest at a rate of libor plus an applicable rate of  with principal and interest due in quarterly installments 
also impacting interest expense was increased interest rates

acquisition related costs in  the company recorded approximately million  or per diluted common share  of acquisition related costs 
acquisition related costs include amortization of acquired intangibles  integration expenses  employee retention plans  and interest expense on the company s term loan facility used to partially fund the acquisition 
in  the company recorded approximately million of acquisition related costs within cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses  million within selling  general and administrative expenses  and million within interest expense 
acquisition related costs  including integration expenses and retention plans  are expected to continue into  while interest expense is expected to continue over the life of the term loan  or five years 
the amortization of the acquired intangible assets  which was approximately million in  is expected to continue for the estimated lives of the intangible assets  or a weighted average life of approximately years 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the nature of the company s business is to have two distinct selling seasons  spring and fall 
the first and second quarters of the fiscal year make up the spring season and the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year make up the fall season 
within the spring season  direct marketing sales are typically stronger in the first quarter  while retail store sales are slightly stronger in the second quarter 
within the fall season  both retail and direct marketing sales are generally stronger in the fourth quarter 
total company sales for the fourth quarters of and were and  respectively  of total sales for the year

generally  the company achieved this by conducting major sale events at the end of the second and fourth quarters  followed by clearance selling in the talbots brand outlet stores 
in august  the talbots brand introduced a web outlet as an additional vehicle to liquidate its markdown inventory 
the j 
jill brand merchandising strategy has focused on liquidating overstock inventory through price reductions in the retail stores and online  sale catalogs  and the j 
jill brand outlet stores 
these sales events and promotional activities produce an increase in sales volume  however  since marking down the value of inventory increases expense  the company s 
table of contents cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses increase as a percentage of net sales 
merchandise inventories typically peak in the third quarter in preparation for the fall and holiday season 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are generally highest in the first and third quarters as a result of sales volumes 
the combined effect of the patterns of net sales  cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  described above  have historically produced higher operating income margins  as a percent of sales  in the first and third quarters 
in the future and beyond  the company believes operating income margins  as a percent of sales  could be more consistent across quarters due to the change in merchandising strategy implemented by the company at the end of in november  the company altered its markdown strategy from four major sale events per year to regular monthly sale events 
the company plans to utilize this strategy across both brands going forward 
the change in promotional cadence is expected to provide consumers sale merchandise at a more relevant time and in turn is expected to improve product flow and gross margins for the brand 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities  cash on hand  and line of credit facilities from four banks  with maximum available short term borrowings of million as of february  at february   and february   the company had borrowings outstanding under these facilities in the amounts of and million  respectively 
average borrowings under the company s short term line of credit facilities were million and million during the years ended february  and february   respectively 
since the acquisition of j 
jill  the company s working capital needs have significantly increased 
when the company acquired j 
jill in may  j 
jill had a million revolving credit facility that was used for working capital needs and letters of credit related to inventory purchases 
upon the acquisition of j 
jill  the j 
jill revolving credit facility was terminated 
in march  the company increased its availability under its line of credit facilities by million from million to million 
in august  the company obtained additional capacity under its line of credit facilities  increasing its availability by million from million to million 
the company s line of credit facilities are uncommitted and are maintained at the sole discretion of the banks 
in december  one bank retracted its existing million line of credit facility that was scheduled to expire in february the company repaid its outstanding balance on this million line of credit facility in december when it became due 
subsequent to year end  in march  the company increased its availability under its line of credit facilities by million from million to million 
the company is currently in discussions with other banks to further increase its availability under its existing line of credit facilities 
the company s board of directors has also authorized the company to seek additional availability up to a potential million in total to address future working capital needs 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in increasing its current working capital facility or achieve such additional availability 
there also can be no assurance that its current working capital availability will at all times be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs in the amounts needed 
in the event that the company is unable to increase its borrowing availability under its credit facilities  the company would expect to explore other capital or financing sources 
there can be no assurance that any such other capital or financing sources would be available in the amount or at the time needed 
while the company has increased its capacity under its short term line of credit facilities and may do so further  the company s ability to borrow under these facilities is constrained by financial covenants related to the company s term loan facility the acquisition debt  including its leverage ratio which is impacted by total borrowings 
in the event that the company is in default on its covenants  the acquisition debt could become immediately due and payable unless a waiver of or an amendment to the financial covenants could be obtained 
in november  the company entered into an amendment to the acquisition debt agreement with its lenders which changed its leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants through the remaining term of the loan  effective november  the company was in compliance with its revised financial covenants as of february  
table of contents the acquisition debt agreement contains provisions which define events of default upon the occurrence of which the repayment of the acquisition debt could be accelerated 
the agreement contains covenants restricting a change in control in which aeon usa is no longer the majority shareholder  liens and encumbrances  sale and leaseback transactions  mergers  consolidations  sales of assets  incurrence of additional indebtedness and guaranties  investments and prepayment of subordinated indebtedness 
there are no restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends or purchase its capital stock so long as the company is not in default under the agreement 
the agreement also includes financial covenants  including a leverage ratio calculated as total indebtedness divided by a month rolling consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  restructuring charges  and discontinued operations ebitda as defined in the agreement 
in november  the leverage ratio was amended 
for the period from november  through fiscal year  the leverage ratio is not to exceed to for fiscal year  the leverage ratio is not to exceed to and for fiscal year and thereafter  the leverage ratio is not to exceed to other financial covenants under the agreement include a minimum net worth calculated as the sum of the par value of all outstanding common stock  additional paid in capital  and retained earnings of million  and a fixed charge coverage ratio calculated as consolidated ebitda plus amounts paid on operating lease obligations ebitdar as defined in the agreement divided by net interest expense plus amounts paid on operating lease obligations 
in november  the fixed charge coverage ratio was amended 
for the period from november  through fiscal year  the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than to for fiscal year  the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than to and for fiscal year and thereafter  the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than to the company s financial covenants are required to be calculated at the end of each of the company s fiscal quarters for as long as the acquisition debt is outstanding 
the company s working capital requirements and borrowing needs are typically highest during the third quarter in preparation for the fall selling season and lowest during the second and fourth quarters 
the company has considered its expected future working capital and borrowing needs and expected future earnings in evaluating its financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company will satisfy its financial covenants as of each determination date 
in addition  any failure by the company to meet its sales plan at the talbots brand or j 
jill brand at any time would cause reduced sales and likely increased markdowns  which could negatively impact gross margin and profitability and the company s ability to meet its financial covenants 
if the company determines that it is likely that it will not satisfy any of its financial covenants  either as a result of its expected operating results or borrowing needs  the company would expect to seek a waiver or an amendment of such financial covenants 
in the event that the company does not satisfy one or more financial covenants as of the determination date and  in addition  is unable to obtain a waiver or further amendment of such financial covenants  the acquisition debt as well as other indebtedness could be accelerated 
the company had letter of credit agreements totaling million at february   which it has historically used primarily for the purchase of the majority of its merchandise inventories 
at february  and february   the company had million and million  respectively  outstanding under these letters of credit 
the million of letter of credit agreements at february  were held with two banks in the amounts of million and million 
in april of  the company s letter of credit facility with one of its banks was reduced from million to million 
the bank also notified the company that the revised million limit would be gradually reduced to through august of also  in february of  the company s letter of credit agreement for the remaining capacity of million expired 
the company and the bank held discussions through april of regarding the agreement that had expired and the potential for a new agreement 
during that time  the bank continued to allow the company to utilize letters of credit under the terms of the expired agreement 
in april of  the bank notified the company that it would honor the then current outstanding drawings under the letter of credit agreement  but that no new facility would be provided and no new drawings under the agreement would be accepted 
however  the company has successfully negotiated open account terms  with improved payment terms  with those vendors that currently represent the majority of the company s merchandise purchases  and the company may pursue open account terms with other merchandise vendors as well 
these open account payment terms do not require letters of credit and are expected to largely offset the reduction and elimination of the letter of credit facilities 
the negotiated new vendor payment terms are also expected to favorably impact cash flow 

table of contents the company is also pursuing new letter of credit arrangements with other lenders to utilize for certain inventory purchases  particularly for smaller merchandise vendors 
the company will continue to use the remaining balance of its letter of credit facility up to august   when it is reduced to zero  while it pursues a replacement letter of credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain new letter of credit facilities to cover merchandise purchases if and when needed or that the company will at all times be able to purchase all of its merchandise inventory through open account payment terms with merchandise vendors

the remaining increase in cash provided by operating activities was due changes in inventory levels  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
the change in inventory levels was due to the company s planned reduction of talbots brand inventory receipts during the company currently plans to reduce inventory receipts across both brands further in both the spring and fall seasons of in comparison to  with both spring and fall commitments currently expected to be down high single digits in comparison to the company believes that maintaining leaner inventories will be a key component to improving gross margins in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily due to the deferral of vendor payments for expenses and merchandise shipments 
the company obtained better payment terms from its vendors in order to pay down its short term line of credit facilities at february  which improved cash flow  outstanding debt  and financial covenant coverage 
the company expects to receive improved payment terms from its merchandise vendors in which would provide for improved cash flows from operating activities

the company plans to scale back its store expansion plan to approximately stores  including talbots brand stores and j 
jill brand stores  during this level of store expansion is significantly down from the company s historical levels and will enable the 
table of contents company to preserve more capital for information technology enhancements  specifically for the growth of the brands websites  and store conversions

in light of the current macro economic environment and the company s outlook and future results  there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid at the same rate  or at all  in the future

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the applicable balance sheets and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the applicable reporting periods 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  retirement plans  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
the estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
however  there is no assurance that such judgments and estimates will reflect actual results or that such estimates or their underlying assumptions may not need to change materially in the future to reflect actual experience 
inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant asset on the company s balance sheet  representing approximately of total assets at february  historically  the company managed its talbots brand inventory levels by typically holding four major sale events per year in its stores and catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
these events served to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remaining goods are transferred to the talbots brand outlet stores 
in november  the company changed its markdown cadence from its historical four clearance events per year to markdowns on a monthly basis 
the company believes that this change will allow the brand to improve its product flow to ensure new and relevant offerings for its customer 
the company has managed its j 
jill brand inventory levels primarily by internal liquidation vehicles including sales catalogs  internet  price reductions in the retail stores  and the j 
jill brand outlet stores 
after the internal capacity is exceeded  external channels such as discount marketers and inventory liquidators may be utilized 
consistent with the retail inventory method  at the end of each reporting period  reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown past season inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of markdown inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise 
the future markdown rate is reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
historically  the difference between management s estimates and actual markdowns has not been significant 
if market conditions were to decline or customer acceptance of product was not favorable  the company may have excess inventory on hand and may be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
management believes that at february  and february   the markdown reserve was appropriate based on current markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends  and forecasts of future sales of markdown inventory 
the markdown reserve rate at february  and february  was and  respectively  of past season markdown inventory 
a basis point increase or decrease in this rate would impact pre tax income by approximately million in both and sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  the company receives customer merchandise returns through both its catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels  and projected future return levels 
the sales return reserve calculation consists of two separate components 
the stores component is based on an analysis that tracks daily sales over the preceding six or twelve month period and actual returns processed against those sales 
a six or twelve month rolling average return rate is applied against the actual sales and the difference between the estimated returns and actual returns is booked as a reserve 
the model also applies a component to reduce the reserve for returns that result in merchandise exchanges 
these types of returns are tracked by the store 
table of contents systems and the estimate is applied against the return reserve 
the direct marketing component is based on a similar process except that sales are tracked by catalog and return rates are based on forecasted estimates for the entire life of the catalog and are based on current and historical return experience 
periodically both components of the calculation are validated by comparing the assumptions used to the actual returns processed 
historically  the difference between estimated sales returns and actual returns has not been significant 
if customer acceptance of the product was not favorable or the product quality were to deteriorate  future actual returns may increase  resulting in a higher return rate and increased charges to earnings 
management believes that the reserve balances at february  and february  of million and million  respectively  were appropriate based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
customer loyalty program 
the company maintains a customer loyalty program in which talbots us brand customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching a specified purchase level on their talbots charge accounts 
customers may redeem their appreciation awards toward future merchandise purchases on the talbots charge card 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
typically  the customer receives one point for each one dollar purchased 
each time a customer reaches points within the program year  the customer is issued a twenty five dollar appreciation award 
typically  the company runs three promotional events  in march  september  and december  where the customer is credited two points for each one dollar purchased 
in  the company also ran an additional promotional event in june 
appreciation award expense is calculated as a percent of talbots charge sales and is based on expected redemption rates and is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
each month  the company performs an analysis of the accrual account balance and factors in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions  and the level of award points earned 
the company also performs a monthly analysis of issuances and redemptions to identify trends in the redemption rate 
adjustments are made to the accrual based on trends and changes in the program 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percentage of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales  and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
management believes that the accrual balances at february  and february  were appropriate based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
a change in redemptions or issuances would have changed pre tax income by approximately million in and million in retirement plans 
the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time talbots brand and shared service employees  two non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans collectively  the serp for certain talbots brand current and former key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and provides certain medical benefits for most talbots brand retired employees under postretirement medical plans 
in  the company elected to close participation in the pension plan for all associates hired or rehired after december   however the company has chosen not to stop the accrual for future benefits for employees hired by the company on or before december  in calculating its retirement plan obligations and related expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to plan participants and allocates this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
the plans are valued annually as of december st 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of the company s obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase by certain plan participants  and the assumed healthcare trend rates on the postretirement medical plans 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based  in part  upon a discount rate modeling process that involves applying a methodology which matches the future benefit payment stream to a discount curve yield for the plan 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the company s obligation and periodic expense attributable to its employee benefits plans 
at december  and  the discount rates used for the pension plan were and  respectively 
the discount rates used for the serp were and 
table of contents at december  and  respectively 
to the extent that the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s obligations are decreased or increased accordingly 
a basis point decrease in the discount rates utilized would have impacted the company s pre tax income by million in and million in the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based on an analysis which considers actual net returns for the pension plan since inception  ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the three major classes of investments in which the company invests debt  equity  and foreign securities for the period since the pension plan s inception and for the longer period commencing when the return data was first tracked  and expectations of future market returns from outside sources for the three major classes of investments in which the company invests 
this rate is utilized primarily in estimating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over approximately five years 
during both and  the company utilized as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have impacted the company s pre tax income by million and million in and  respectively 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is based on historical and expected compensation increases 
the company utilized a rate of for both periods beginning december  and december  this rate is utilized principally in estimating the retirement obligation and annual expense 
an increase in the assumed average rate of compensation increase from to would have impacted the company s pre tax income by million in and million in the assumed health care expense trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical plans 
the healthcare cost escalation rate is used to determine the postretirement obligation and annual expense 
at december  and  the company used and  respectively  as initial cost escalation rates that gradually trend down to 
to the extent that these rates increase or decrease  the company s obligation and associated expense are increased or decreased accordingly 
an increase in the assumed health care trend rate from to in would have no material impact on the company s pre tax income 
an increase in the assumed health care trend rates from to would have impacted the company s pre tax income by million in at december  and  management believes that the assumptions used in the calculation of its retirement plans and postretirement medical plan liabilities were reasonable 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically reviews the period of depreciation or amortization for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine whether current circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
the company monitors the carrying value of its assets for potential impairment based primarily on projected future cash flows 
if an impairment is identified  the carrying value of the asset is compared to its estimated fair value and provisions for impairment are recorded as appropriate 
impairment losses are significantly impacted by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value 
the company s estimates of future operating cash flows are based upon the company s experience  knowledge  and expectations 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as the company s future operating results  future store profitability  and future economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
while the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows could affect the company s evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
additionally  the company s initiative to continue to critically assess individual store profitability on an ongoing basis in an effort to restore profitability could result in an increased number of stores closed  resulting in a larger impairment charge against the carrying value of the associated store assets in future periods 
the company recorded impairment charges relating to store assets in the amount of million including store impairments relating to the closing of the talbots kids and talbots mens business concepts of million included within restructuring charges and million for the years ended february  and february   respectively 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company tests goodwill and trademarks for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level  or one level below an operating segment  on an annual basis  or when events indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired 
the company has elected the first day of each fiscal year as its measurement date 
the company completed its annual goodwill and trademark impairment tests as of the first day of each of the  and fiscal years and as a result  no impairments were recognized 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed an additional goodwill and trademark impairment test due to the lower than expected sales and operating performance of the talbots and j 
jill brands as well as the overall decline on the company s market value 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step impairment test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow and a market value approach 
the evaluation of goodwill requires the company to use significant judgments and estimates  including but not limited to projected future revenues  cash flows  and discount rates 
the company s estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business models  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect the company s future financial results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the activities in the second step include valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit s goodwill based upon the residual of the summed identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
the fair value of the talbots brand reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the assigned net assets  therefore no further testing was required and an impairment charge was not required 
the fair value of the j 
jill brand reporting units was below the carrying value of the assigned net assets  therefore the second step was required 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million relating to goodwill 
trademarks that have been determined to have indefinite lives are also not subject to amortization and are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment  as mentioned above 
the fair value of the company s trademarks are estimated and compared to their carrying value 
the company estimates the fair value of these intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
this approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future growth and trends  royalty rates in the category of intellectual property  discount rates and other variables 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could materially affect the company s future financial results 
the company recognizes an impairment charge when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
as a result of the impairment analysis performed in connection with the company s trademarks with indefinite lives  the company determined that the carrying value of the trademark related to its j 
jill reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value 
accordingly  during  the company recorded pre tax charges of million million after tax to reduce the value of the trademark to its estimated fair value 
this impairment primarily resulted from a decline in future anticipated cash flows relating to the j 
jill brand 
income taxes 
the company is routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings and changes in the expected outcome of audits 
management believes that at february  and february   the accruals for income taxes were appropriate 
the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
on february  fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as a result of the adoption of fin no 
 as of february   the company 
table of contents recognized a million increase in its reserve related to uncertain tax positions which was recorded as a reduction to the february  balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the company recorded an increase in deferred tax assets of million  a corresponding increase in the reserve related to uncertain tax positions of million  and an increase in accrued tax related interest of million related primarily to federal tax benefits associated with certain state tax and interest reserves and timing differences 
as of the adoption date  the company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million of which million  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
as of february   the company had unrecognized tax benefits of million  of which million  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
as of february  and february   the total amount of accrued tax related interest and penalties included in other liabilities was as follows tax related interest of million and million  respectively  and penalties of million and million  respectively 
there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  the associated interest and penalties have also been recognized 
changes in facts  expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the company s effective tax rate and consequently  affect the company s results 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r 
to calculate the fair value of options  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated expected volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  the expected dividend rate  and the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon bond issues with a term approximately equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules  historical exercise patterns  and expectations of future exercise patterns 
the company s expected volatility of its common stock price is based primarily upon historical volatilities of the company s stock from public data sources and also considers implied factors that may influence the company s volatility 
the expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated annual payment of dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on data derived from public sources regarding us treasury zero coupon bond issues 
management s estimates of expected volatility and expected life have the greatest impact on determining the fair value of options granted 
if the expected volatility or expected life were to increase  the fair value of the stock award would be higher resulting in increased compensation charges 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company utilized different assumptions  the recorded stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
the fair values of nonvested stock awards and restricted stock units are based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and the related stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the vesting period on awards granted as performance accelerated nonvested stock is a five year period  but can be accelerated to three years after the grant date depending on the achievement of certain corporate financial goals 
if the company determined that the achievement of certain corporate financial goals was going to occur where it had previously concluded that achievement of such goals would not occur  then the vesting period would be reduced at that time and the future related expense amounts would increase 
certain other shares of nonvested stock are time vested generally between periods of two to four years 
restricted stock units generally vest over one year 
in addition  an estimated forfeiture rate is applied in the recognition of the compensation charge 
the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 
management 
table of contents compares actual forfeitures with estimates and revises its estimates if differences occur 
if actual forfeitures rates are lower than management s estimates  the company s compensation expense would increase 
conversely  if actual forfeitures are greater than management s estimates  the company s compensation expense would decrease 
the company s results of operations will be impacted by differences between estimated and actual forfeitures 
a decrease in the assumed forfeiture rate would have decreased the company s pre tax income by million and million for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
the future impact of the cost of share based compensation on the company s results of operations  including net income and earnings per diluted share  will depend on  among other factors  the level of the company s equity awards in the future as well as the market price of shares at the time of award as well as various other assumptions used in valuing such awards
