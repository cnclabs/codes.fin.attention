 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the company s guarantees issued subject to the recognition and disclosure requirements of fin as of december  and were not material

prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations because the exercise price of the company s stock options granted to employees and directors approximated or exceeded the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant

stock based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of prior to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r

goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over fair value or net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is subject to a periodic impairment assessment by applying a fair value test based upon a two step method 
the first step of the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit  including any goodwill 
the company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation methodology to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting unit  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired in which case the second step in the process is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  the company performs the second step to measure the amount of impairment loss 
any impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill  calculated per sfas no 
 with the carrying amount of goodwill at the reporting unit  with the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value recognized as an impairment loss 
long lived assets the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
the statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions  recurring losses  or a forecasted inability to achieve break even operating results over an extended period 
the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets based upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
should impairment in value be indicated  the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted  based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
sfas no 
also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell

we are reducing cash required for operations by reducing operating costs and reducing staff levels 
in addition  we are working to manage our current liabilities while we continue to make changes in operations to improve our cash flow and liquidity position 
our registered independent certified public accountants have stated in their report dated march   that we have incurred operating losses in the past years  and that we are dependent upon management s ability to develop profitable operations 
these factors among others may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
while we have raised capital in the first quarter of to meet our working capital and financing needs  additional financing is required in order to meet our current and projected cashflow requirements from operations and development 
additional investments are being sought  but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such investments 
financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities  obtaining credit facilities  or other financing mechanisms 
however  the trading price of our common stock and the downturn in the us stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
even if we are able to raise the funds required  it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses  fail to collect significant amounts owed to us  or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing 
further  if we issue additional equity or debt securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we will have to curtail our operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain off balance sheet arrangements nor do we participate in any non exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting treatment
