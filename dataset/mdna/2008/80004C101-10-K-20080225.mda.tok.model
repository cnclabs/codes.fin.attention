our mission is to provide simple  reliable and affordable storage for consumer use in portable devices 
we sell sandisk branded products for consumer electronics through broad global retail and original equipment manufacturer  or oem  distribution channels 
we design  develop and manufacture products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory  controller and firmware technologies 
we source the vast majority of our flash memory supply through our significant venture relationships with toshiba corporation  or toshiba  which provide us with leading edge low cost memory wafers 
our cards are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones  digital cameras  gaming devices and laptop computers 
we also produce universal serial bus  or usb  drives  mp players and other flash storage products that are embedded in a variety of systems for the enterprise  industrial  military and other markets 
our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
we believe the market for flash storage is price elastic 
accordingly  we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices  consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes and or units of memory and that over time  new markets will emerge 
in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products  we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the 
table of contents change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer and the average capacity of our products must grow enough to offset price declines 
we seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon 
we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 at the beginning of fiscal year fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our financial position and result of operations 
for further discussion on adoption of fin  please refer to note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories and related reserves  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at december  and december   deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
additionally  we have incentive programs that require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues 
in calculating the value of sales incentive programs  actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers 
the timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates  which could impact the revenue we report 
inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for 
table of contents our products within specific time horizons  generally six to twelve months 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than our product on hand and our noncancelable orders  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
accounting for variable interest entities 
we evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
r  or fin r  accounting for variable interest entities 
if those entities are variable interest entities  or vies  we then determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to expected gains and losses 
the assessment of the primary beneficiary includes an analysis of the forecast and contractual stipulations of the vie 
determining whether we would consolidate or apply the equity method to a particular vie requires review of the vie s forecast  which involves analysis of company specific data  industry data  known trends and uncertainties  which are inherently subjective 
consolidating a vie under fin r rather than using the equity method can materially impact revenue  gross margin and operating income trends 
deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
while we have been profitable over the last several years  we compete in an industry with recurring average selling price declines 
these price declines require us to apply judgment related to our forecast of future profitability and our recoverability of net deferred tax assets 
unanticipated downturns  alternative technologies or other negative factors in a continually changing high technology industry could result in declining future profitability and have an adverse impact on the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence  complexity of the matter  available federal tax case law  interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates 
there is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results 
share based compensation employee incentive plans and employee stock purchase plans 
accounting for share based compensation awards and accounting for employee stock purchase plan  or espp  shares are based upon the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas r  share based payments  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation 
the fair value of share based awards and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes merton closed form option valuation model 
the black scholes merton model requires the input of assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the parameters used in the model are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis 
we recognized compensation expense for the fair values of these awards  which have graded vesting  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of each of these awards  net of estimated forfeitures at a rate of 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the apic credit pool generated by previous share based compensation excess tax benefits to determine if there are any tax deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
business combinations 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
management makes significant estimates and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer relationships  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed

depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future 
we may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions 
these activities may require us to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from funding the flash ventures with toshiba  increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies  growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business

toshiba ventures 
we are a percent owner in flashvision  flash partners and flash alliance  or collectively referred to as flash ventures  our business ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nand flash memory products 
these nand flash memory products are manufactured by toshiba at toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flash ventures 
this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the ventures from us and toshiba 
flash ventures purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup 
we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flash ventures nand wafer supply 
we are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers 
in addition to the semiconductor assets owned or leased by flash ventures  we directly own certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations from which we receive of the output 
see note  related parties and strategic investments  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
from time to time  we and toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of flash ventures that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding 
as of december   flash partners fab had reached full capacity of approximately  wafers per month  however  we expect to continue to invest in flash partners in order to convert to the next technology node 
the capacity of flash alliance s fab at full expansion is expected to be approximately  wafers per month  and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually 
table of contents agreed upon by both parties 
in fiscal year  we expect to invest approximately billion in flash ventures  which we expect will be funded through additional investments  loans  lease guarantees and working capital contributions to flash ventures 
on february   we signed a non binding memorandum of understanding with toshiba for a new memory wafer fab in japan 
no specific investment amount has been determined by the parties 
however  we expect in fiscal year and beyond to be required to make investments  loans and guarantees related to our portion of the equipment and start up costs  should a definitive agreement be signed 
see note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the cost of the wafers we purchase from flash ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of sales 
flash ventures are variable interest entities  and we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of expected gains and losses with respect to each venture 
accordingly  we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate 
under flash ventures agreements  we agreed to share in toshiba s costs associated with nand product development and its common semiconductor research and development activities 
as of december   we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of million 
our common research and development obligation related to flash ventures is variable but capped at fixed quarterly amounts through fiscal year in addition to general nand product development and common semiconductor research performed by toshiba  both parties perform direct research and development activities specific to flash ventures  and our contribution is based on a variable computation 
we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory 
for semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by flash ventures  we and or toshiba guaranteed  in whole or in part  a portion of the outstanding lease payments under each of those leases through various methods 
these obligations are denominated in japanese yen and are noncancelable 
under the terms of the flashvision lease  toshiba guaranteed these commitments on behalf of flashvision and we agreed to indemnify toshiba for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of its guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
as of december   the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation  which reflects payments and any lease adjustments  was approximately billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at december  under the terms of flash partners and flash alliance leases  we guaranteed on an unsecured and several basis of flash partners and flash alliance s lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from december through november our total lease obligation guarantee  net of lease payments as of december   was billion japanese yen  or approximately billion based upon the exchange rate at december  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december   and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years is presented in textual and tabular format in note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have not used financial instruments to hedge our economic exposures related to costs or revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash wafers 
in addition  we also have significant expenses denominated in the chinese renminbi  or rmb  and the israeli new israel shekel  or ils 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
in fiscal years and  we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense or accumulated other income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified marketable securities  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
movements in currency exchange rates  especially the japanese yen  could cause variability in our revenues  expenses  or other income expense  net 
we had net forward exchange contracts in place to sell the us dollar equivalent of approximately million in foreign currencies based upon the exchange rate at december  and approximately million as of december  the effect of an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate million loss 
however  as we utilize foreign currency instruments for mitigating anticipated balance sheet exposures  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the functional currency value of the underlying non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
see item a  risk factors and note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
as of december   a reduction in prices of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
