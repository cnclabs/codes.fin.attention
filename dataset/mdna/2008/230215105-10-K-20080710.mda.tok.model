the company s operations are classified into two business segments mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics 
the mattress fabrics segment primarily manufactures  sources  and sells fabrics to bedding manufacturers 
the upholstery fabrics segment sources  manufacturers and sells fabrics primarily to residential and commercial contract furniture manufacturers 
the company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based upon income loss from operations before restructuring and related charges or credits  certain unallocated corporate expenses  and certain other non recurring items

the company s net sales for fiscal increased to million  compared with million for fiscal the overall sales increase reflects an increase in mattress fabric sales mostly offset by a decrease in upholstery fabric sales in fiscal the sales increase in the mattress fabrics segment reflects the incremental sales related to the company s acquisition of itg s mattress fabrics product line in january and a shift in the product mix toward knitted fabrics  which have a higher selling price 
the sales decline in the upholstery fabrics segment reflects very weak demand industry wide  as well as continued soft demand for us produced upholstery fabrics driven by consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and other imported furniture and fabrics

as a result  the company has moved with them and responded with an operation designed to meet their fabric needs 
the company s offshore upholstery fabric business is its china operation  which began manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal this initiative involved a strategy to link the company s existing customer relationships  design expertise  and production technology with low cost fabric manufacturing in china  while continuing to maintain high quality standards 
the company is currently leasing six facilities in the shanghai region of china  where fabrics sourced in china are inspected and tested to assure compliance with the company s quality standards before shipment to its customers

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of an asset or liability 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to a timing difference is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
as of april   the company had net us deferred income tax assets of million 
us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards with related future tax benefits on a gross basis was approximately million at april  these carryforwards principally expire in years  fiscal through fiscal the company also has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  which does not expire 
in making the judgment about the realization of the us net deferred tax assets  management has considered both the negative and positive evidence  and concluded that sufficient positive evidence exists to overcome the cumulative losses experienced in recent years 
specifically  management considered the following  among other factors nature of the company s products  history of positive earnings in the mattress fabrics segment  capital projects in progress to further enhance the company s globally competitive cost structure in the mattress fabrics segment  recent restructuring actions in the us upholstery fabrics business to adjust the us cost structure and bring us manufacturing capacity in line with demand  development of offshore manufacturing and sourcing programs to meet changing demands of upholstery fabric customers in the us  inter company agreements with the company s china subsidiaries expected to be in place in fiscal for various consulting services and intellectual property  and the incremental sales volume from the purchase of certain assets from itg related to the mattress fabric product line of itg s burlington house division 
management s analysis of taxable income also included the following considerations none of the company s net operating loss carryforwards have previously expired unused  the us federal carryforward period is years  and the company s current income tax loss carryforwards principally expire in years  in fiscal through the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future us taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
no provision is made for income taxes which may be payable if undistributed income of the company s foreign subsidiaries were to be paid as dividends to the company  since the company intends that such earnings will continue to be invested 
at april   the amount of such undistributed income was million 
foreign tax credits may be available as a reduction of united states income taxes in the event of such distributions 
we adopted the provisions of fin on april  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of  to the april  balance of retained earnings 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of april   the date of adoption  was million  of which million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized  would favorably affect the income tax rate in future periods 
as of the date of adoption  the total amount of interest and penalties due to unrecognized tax benefits was  the following table sets forth the change to the company s unrecognized tax benefit dollars in thousands balance at april   increases from prior period tax positions  decreases from prior period tax positions increases from current period tax positions balance at april   at april   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits  of which million represents the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the income tax rate in future periods 
at april   the total amount of interest and penalties due to unrecognized tax benefits was  the liability for uncertain tax positions includes million related to tax positions for which significant change is reasonably possible in fiscal this amount relates to double taxation under applicable tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal and various state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions including canada and china

as more fully disclosed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
at april   the company recognized million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
the final outcome of these tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  legal proceedings  competent authority proceedings  changes in regulatory tax laws  or interpretations of those tax laws  or expiration of statutes of limitation 
at april   the company classified the million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes payable long term 
while the company cannot reasonably predict the timing of the cash flows associated with its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  it believes that no significant cash payments will be made within the next five years due to its us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards

depreciation for fiscal was million  of which million related to the mattress fabrics segment and million related to the upholstery fabrics segment 
the company currently expects total capital expenditures to be million in fiscal  of which million will be paid in cash and million will be vendor financed on a project initiated prior to the end of fiscal the capital spending of million primarily relates to the mattress fabrics segment

see risk factors at item a 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of april   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and accounts receivable from bedding manufacturers totaled approximately million 
additionally  as of april   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
lastly  a single customer within the upholstery fabrics segment and another within the mattress fabrics segment represented and  respectively  of accounts receivable at april  the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
the reserve balance for doubtful accounts was million at april  and april   respectively 
inventory valuation 
the company operates as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the reserve for inventory markdowns was million and million at april  and april   respectively 
long lived assets 
the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes an impairment accounting model for long lived assets to be held and used  disposed of by sale  or disposed of by abandonment or other means 
management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in fiscal  the company prepared an impairment evaluation on its upholstery fabrics segment due to continued adverse business results for us produced products  requiring further restructuring actions 
the company s assessment indicated that the net undiscounted future operating cash flows of this segment were sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived assets to be held and used for the upholstery fabrics segment 
the determination of future operating cash flows involves considerable estimation and judgment about future market conditions  future sales and profitability  and future asset utilization 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions  or a decision to dispose of substantial portions of these assets  could result in materially different results 
goodwill 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill to no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment by comparing each reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
as of april   the company s remaining million of goodwill relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
the company performed its goodwill impairment test as of april  for its mattress fabrics segment 
this impairment test did not indicate any impairment of goodwill for fiscal the determination of fair value involves considerable estimation and judgment 
in particular  determining the fair value of a business unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
restructuring charges 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas no 
 a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity must be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for certain employee termination benefits that qualify under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the upholstery fabric segment continues to be under significant pressure from a variety of external forces  such as the current consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and the growing competition from imported fabrics and cut and sewn kits 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses and scale us productive capacity in line with current and expected demand trends  the company has undertaken restructuring initiatives during the past several years 
these restructuring initiatives have resulted in restructuring charges related to the remaining lease costs of the closed facilities  the write down of property  plant and equipment  workforce reduction and elimination of facilities 
severance and related charges are accrued at the date the restructuring is approved by the board of directors based on an estimate of amounts that will be paid to affected employees  in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 asset impairment charges related to the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities are based on an estimate of expected sales prices for the real estate and equipment 
other exit costs  which principally consist of charges for lease termination and losses from termination of existing contracts  equipment relocation costs and inventory markdowns that are related to the restructuring are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the company reassesses the individual accrual requirements at the end of each reporting period 
if circumstances change  causing current estimates to differ from original estimates  adjustments are recorded in the period of change 
restructuring charges  and adjustments of those charges  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its income tax exposure and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
at april   the company had us deferred tax assets of million and us deferred tax liabilities all of which reverse in the carryforward period of million  resulting in net us deferred tax assets of million 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the company s net us deferred tax assets 
management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the benefit of its net us deferred tax assets 
in making the judgment about the realization of the us net deferred tax assets  management has considered both the negative and positive evidence  and concluded that sufficient positive evidence exists to overcome the cumulative losses experienced in recent years 
specifically  management considered the following  among other factors nature of the company s products  history of positive earnings in the mattress fabrics segment  capital projects in progress to further enhance the company s globally competitive cost structure in the mattress fabrics segment  recent restructuring actions in the us upholstery fabrics business to adjust the us cost structure and bring us manufacturing capacity in line with demand  development of offshore manufacturing and sourcing programs to meet changing demands of upholstery fabric customers in the us  inter company agreements with the company s china subsidiaries expected to be in place in fiscal for various consulting services and intellectual property  and the incremental sales volume from the purchase of certain assets from the itg related to the mattress fabric product line of itg s burlington house division 
management s analysis of taxable income also included the following considerations none of the company s net operating loss carryforwards have previously expired unused  the us federal carryforward period is years  and the company s current income tax loss carryforwards principally expire in years  fiscal through the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however could be reduced if estimates of future us taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
considerable judgment is involved in this process as the ultimate realization of benefits is dependent on the generation of taxable income from future us operations 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  fin on april  under fin we must recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as tax expense 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions and in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an adjustable margin under the company s revolving credit agreement in the united states and its real estate term loans 
as of april   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the company s real estate term loans and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the first real estate term loan  the company entered into a  notional principal interest rate swap agreement  which represents of the original principal amount on the first real estate term loan  and effectively converts the floating rate libor based payments to fixed payments at plus the spread calculated under the real estate term loan agreement 
the company s unsecured senior term notes have a fixed interest rate of and the canadian government loan is non interest bearing 
the company s revolving credit agreement associated with its china subsidiary bears interest at a rate determined by the chinese government 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement as of april  also  million of the company s total borrowings of million are at a fixed rate or were non interest bearing 
thus  the company would not expect any foreseeable change in the interest rates would not expect to have a material effect on the company 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies for their subsidiaries domiciled in china and canada 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign subsidiaries

the company s foreign subsidiaries use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
a substantial portion of the company s imports purchased outside the united states are denominated in us dollars 
a change in either exchange rate at april   would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
