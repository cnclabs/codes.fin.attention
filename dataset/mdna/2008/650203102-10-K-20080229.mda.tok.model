item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  located elsewhere in the report for further discussion related to the process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
newalliance may experience higher levels of loan losses due to economic conditions 
newalliance s business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national and local economic conditions 
these fluctuations are not predictable  cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial condition 
for example  recent declines in housing activity including declines in building permits  housing starts and home prices may make it more difficult for our borrowers to sell their homes or refinance their debt 
sales may also slow  which could strain the resources of real estate developers and builders 
many analysts are now predicting the us economy is in or will experience a recession in the near term 
this could affect employment levels and the ability of our borrowers to service their debt 
the bank may suffer higher loan losses as a result of these factors and the resulting impact on our borrowers 
strong competition within newalliance s market areas may limit growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
in our market areas  we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
as we grow  we will be expanding into market areas where we may not be as well known as other institutions that have been operating in those areas for some time 
in addition  regional  super regional and national interstate banking institutions have become increasingly active in our market areas 
many of these competitors  in particular the regional  super regional and national institutions  have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot efficiently provide 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
the greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to grow profitably 
newalliance may not pay you dividends if newalliance is not able to receive dividends from its subsidiary  newalliance bank 
cash dividends from newalliance bank and our liquid assets are our principal sources of funds for paying cash dividends on our common stock 
unless we receive dividends from newalliance bank or choose to use our liquid assets  we may not be able to pay dividends 
newalliance bank s ability to pay us dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements 
newalliance is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision newalliance  primarily through newalliance bank and certain non bank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not stockholders 
these regulations affect the company s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject the company to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while newalliance has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
see the section captioned supervision and regulation in item of this report for further information 
newalliance may not be able to attract and retain skilled people newalliance s success depends  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the company can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of the company s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the business because of their skills  knowledge of the market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
newalliance continually encounters technological change the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
however  some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  its financial condition and results of operations 
newalliance s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
customer information may be obtained and used fraudulently risk of theft of customer information resulting from security breaches by third parties exposes the company to reputation risk and potential monetary loss 
the company has exposure to fraudulent use of our customer s personal information resulting from its general business operations and through customer use of financial instruments  such as debit cards 
if a breach in security does occur in the marketplace and the financial data of our customers is compromised  the company will react as quickly as possible to protect customer accounts and limit potential losses to the company 
newalliance s stock price can be volatile 
newalliance s stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  new technology used  or services offered  by competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the company or the company s competitors  failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to newalliance  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  changes in government regulations  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes  credit loss trends or currency fluctuations could also cause newalliance s stock price to decrease regardless of the company s operating results
