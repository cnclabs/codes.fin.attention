table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures 
we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different  it is possible that different accounting would have been applied  resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  please see note accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities over which we exercise control 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation  and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings applicable to minority interests 
long lived assets and intangibles investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method 
the cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
we estimate fair values of the components of assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date 
recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts  management agreements and related customer relationships 
our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land and improvements  ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  above and or below market leases  other intangibles embedded in contracts and any debt assumed 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations  as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives 
additionally  the amortization of value assigned to above and or below market leases is recorded as a component of revenue  as compared to the amortization of in place leases and other intangibles  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income included in item of this annual report on form k 
we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis  and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset  internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio 
the fair value of in place leases  if any  reflects i above and below market leases  if any  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals  the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is 
table of contents amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods  if applicable  ii the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants  including tenant allowances  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease  and iii an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period  as if the acquired space was vacant  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease 
we also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with the tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant 
we amortize such value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases  which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
the fair value of long term debt is calculated by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings 
discount rates are approximated based on the rate we estimate we would incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition 
any fair value adjustments related to long term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value 
an impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
we did not record any impairment charges for the years ended december   and loans and other amounts receivable from third parties we evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors  including i corporate and facility level financial and operations reports  ii compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the borrowing or lease agreement  iii the financial stability of the applicable borrower or tenant and any guarantor and iv the payment history of the borrower or tenant 
our level of reserves  if any  for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors 
revenue recognition certain of our leases  excluding our master lease agreements with kindred the kindred master leases  but including the majority of our leases with brookdale senior living inc together with its subsidiaries  which include brookdale living communities  inc and alterra healthcare corporation  brookdale senior living  provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured  we establish an allowance for estimated losses 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment 
certain of our other leases  including the kindred master leases  provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight 
table of contents line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission the commission staff accounting bulletin i the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
resident fees and services are recognized monthly as services are provided 
move in fees  which are included in resident fees and services  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement 
lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with days notice 
gain on sale of assets we recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this annual report on form k 
gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured  we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit  we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer  and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied 
gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
federal income tax since we have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  prior to the second quarter of we made no provision for federal income tax purposes and we will continue to make no provision for reit income and expense 
as a result of the sunrise reit acquisition  income tax expense or benefit is now being recorded with respect to certain entities which are taxed as taxable reit subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the reit provisions 
deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events  would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs 
deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset  would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs

funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the five years ended december  are summarized in the following table for the year ended december  in thousands net income applicable to common shares adjustments real estate depreciation and amortization real estate depreciation related to minority interest loss on real estate disposals discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate assets depreciation on real estate assets ffo applicable to common shares preferred stock dividends and issuance costs ffo historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values  instead  have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit and we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily 
table of contents interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk we receive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
we also earn revenue from our senior living operations and our real estate loan investments 
our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our canadian credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in libor and bankers acceptance  respectively 
the general fixed nature of our assets subject to long term triple net leases and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the original notional amount of million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between july  and june  the swap 
the swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of and receive libor from the counterparty 
in december  due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of the sale of ten properties  we reduced the notional amount of the swap for the period from december  through june  from million to million 
in december  due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of the payoff of our cmbs loan  we further reduced the notional amount of the swap to million for the remaining term of the swap 
see note borrowing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
there are no collateral requirements under the swap 
as of december   the notional amount of the swap was million  which is scheduled to expire on june  to highlight the sensitivity of the swap and our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and as of december  swap fixed rate debt swap fixed rate debt in thousands notional amount  n a  n a gross book value n a  n a  fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to the assumption of approximately million of fixed rate debt as a result of our acquisitions during the year ended december  and overall changes in interest rates 
n a not applicable 
we paid million under the swap during the year ended december  assuming that interest rates do not change  we estimate that we will pay million on the swap during the year ending december  
table of contents we had approximately million and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from december  is primarily attributable to additional net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our canadian credit facility of million and million  respectively  and the assumption of additional variable debt from the properties managed by sunrise totaling million as of december   offset by the repayment of million in variable mortgage debt in january assumed as part of the senior care acquisition 
the swap currently effectively hedges million of our outstanding variable rate debt 
any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of million are subject to interest rate changes 
however  pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt  and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december   interest expense for would increase by approximately million  or per common share on a diluted basis 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us 
we initially acquired eleven seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia as part of the sunrise reit acquisition 
in addition  we acquired for a fixed price another newly developed community in canada in december as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in us and canadian exchange rates which may  from time to time  have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
as we increase our international presence through investments in  and or acquisitions or development of  seniors housing and or healthcare related assets outside the united states  we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than us or canadian dollars 
although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives including additional borrowings in local currencies to protect against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operation and liquidity  on our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies 
our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
credit risk as a result of our spin off of kindred in may and the provident acquisition in june  we have a significant concentration of credit risk with kindred and brookdale senior living 
for the years ended december  and  kindred accounted for million  or of our total revenues  and million  or of our total revenues  respectively  and brookdale senior living accounted for million  or of our total revenues  and million  or of our total revenues  respectively 
accordingly  the financial condition of kindred and brookdale senior living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities 
see risk factors risks arising from our business we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living  either of kindred s or brookdale senior living s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by  among other things  i reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally  publicly available information regarding tenants  and 
table of contents information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements  and ii having periodic discussions with tenants  borrowers and their representatives 
liquidity and capital resources during  our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from a bridge loan  preferred equity issuance  dispositions  common stock offering  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our canadian credit facility 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations  dividends to stockholders and debt amortization 
capital requirements for acquisitions  however  may require funding from borrowings  assumption of debt from the seller  and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities 
the million of cash and cash equivalents held at december  consists primarily of cash related to our seniors housing communities that is deposited and held in property level accounts
