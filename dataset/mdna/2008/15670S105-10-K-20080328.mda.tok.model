business strategy 
our goals are to improve on profitability and pursue disciplined growth 
the principal features of our strategy are improve our cost structure and profitability 
we have implemented two cost savings plans the cost savings and integration plan  which we refer to as the plan  and the cost savings and restructuring plan  which we refer to as the plan 
the plan relates to activities undertaken in connection with our acquisitions of printegra  cadmus  colorgraphics and commercial envelope  which we refer to as the acquisitions 
under the plan  we closed six manufacturing facilities and integrated those operations into acquired and existing operations 
the plan  which was completed in the fourth quarter of  included such actions as consolidating our purchasing activities and manufacturing platform including closing two manufacturing facilities in that were integrated into existing operations  reducing corporate and field personnel  streamlining our information technology infrastructure and elimination of discretionary spending 
we continue to implement cost savings initiatives that will improve our profitability  both in connection with acquisitions and our ongoing operations 
we regularly assess our operations with a view toward eliminating operations that are not aligned with our core united states operations or are underperforming 
for example  we divested our canadian envelope manufacturing business  supremex  inc  and certain other related assets through a series of transactions in and in  we sold three small and non strategic businesses and closed three facilities that were underperforming 
we continue to evaluate the sale or closure of facilities that do not meet our strategic goals or performance targets 
capitalize on scale advantages 
we believe there are significant advantages to being a large competitor in a highly fragmented industry 
we seek to capitalize on our size  geographic footprint and broad product lines to offer one stop shopping and enhance our overall value proposition 
as we grow in scale and increase our operating leverage  we seek to realize better profit margins through improvements in manufacturing facility utilization 
enhance the supply chain 
we continue to work with our core suppliers to improve all aspects of our purchasing and other logistics as well as to ensure a stable source of supply 
we seek to lower costs through more favorable pricing and payment terms  more effective inventory management and improved communications with vendors 
we continue to consolidate our suppliers of key production inputs such as paper and ink  and believe that significant opportunities exist in optimizing the rest of our supply chain 
seek products and processing improvements 
we encourage regular review of our product offerings  manufacturing processes and distribution methods to ensure that we take advantage of new technology when practical and meet the changing needs of our customers and the demands of a global economy 
we seek to enter into growth product markets in which we may have competitive advantages based on our existing infrastructure  operating expertise and customer relationships 
pharmaceutical labels  direct mail  and specialty packaging are examples of growth areas into which we recently expanded 
by expanding our product offerings  we intend to increase cross selling opportunities to our existing customer base and mitigate the impact of any decline in a given market 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
we continue to selectively review opportunities to expand within growing niche markets  broaden our product offerings and increase our economies of scale through acquisitions 
we will pursue reasonably priced opportunities that we expect to yield greater profitability and cash flow or improved operating efficiencies  such as increased utilization of our assets 
since july  we have completed five acquisitions that we believe will continue to enhance our operating margins and deliver economies of scale 
we believe our acquisition strategy will allow us to both realize increased revenue and cost saving synergies  and apply our management expertise to improve the operations of acquired entities 
for example  our acquisition of commercial envelope strengthened our position in the direct mail market and will allow us to enhance our raw material purchasing power and rationalize our manufacturing platform 
our acquisition of rx technology in july gave us an entry into the pharmaceutical labels business  which has high barriers to entry  while also allowing us to cross sell a broader product platform to new and existing customers

our results for the year ended december  include the operating results of the acquisitions  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates  except for colorgraphics which is included in our operating results from july  since the acquisitions results are not included for a full year in  we expect that our net sales and operating income will increase next year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in  we continued to encounter competitive pricing pressures that result from excess capacity in the industry in concert with declining or weak volume growth in many of our markets 
in addition  the cost of paper  film and other raw materials for our products has increased 
to compete effectively in an environment of excess capacity and rising costs  we are focused on improving productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing our costs 
in  we closed two commercial printing plants and consolidated three commercial printing plants  four documents plants and two envelope plants in connection with the integration of the acquisitions 
in  we sold three small non core printing operations  closed three printing operations and consolidated six envelope plants and two printing operations 
these consolidation activities have assisted us in becoming more efficient at operating our plants at higher levels of utilization 
we also continue to redeploy our assets throughout our manufacturing platform to reduce future capital expenditures

as of march   we had approximately million available under our revolving credit facility 
senior unsecured loan on august   we borrowed million under a new eight year unsecured term loan facility  which we refer to as the senior unsecured loan  with a group of lenders 
proceeds from the senior unsecured loan along with borrowings from the million six year revolving credit facility  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility  and available cash were used to fund the acquisition of commercial envelope  including retiring certain acquired debt  and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition 
the senior unsecured loan has a floating interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate  which we refer to as libor  plus an interest rate margin  which was on december  making the interest rate on that date 
the interest rate margin increases quarterly beginning january up to a maximum interest rate of 
the senior unsecured loan provides for the conversion by the lenders into senior or senior subordinated exchange notes  which we refer to as the exchange notes  similar to the existing indenture relating to our million senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as the notes  or a substantially similar indenture 
if the senior unsecured loan is converted  the exchange notes will bear a fixed rate of interest based on market conditions at the time of conversion 
the senior unsecured loan contains covenants  representations  and warranties substantially similar to our existing million senior secured credit facilities  which we refer to as the amended credit facilities  and includes provisions for an underwriting purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement relating to the resale of the exchange notes 
term loans on july   we increased our then outstanding balance of our seven year term loan facility due  which we refer to as the term loan c  and the delayed draw term loan facility collectively with the term loan c  which we refer to as the term loans  that are part of the amended credit facilities by borrowing an incremental million on the existing financial terms and financial covenants

the credit facilities  established in june see debt refinancing below  were comprised of the revolving credit facility  and a million seven year term loan facility  which we refer to as the term loan b 
the credit facilities were amended by increasing the overall borrowing availability from million to million to create the amended credit facilities  allowing us to retire the term loan b  acquire cadmus  including retiring and extinguishing the cadmus revolving senior bank credit facility which had an outstanding balance of million  using the revolving credit facility and a million term loan c  and retire any and or all of the notes  tendered to us using a million delayed draw term loan facility 
several of the customary financial covenants within the amended credit facilities  including maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  were modified to provide for the incremental funded debt levels and larger company operations 
the amended credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
debt refinancing 
on june   we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that became the credit facilities 
the credit facilities consisted of the revolving credit facility and the term loan b 
the credit facilities were amended in march to become the amended credit facilities  which helped facilitate the purchase of cadmus 
the credit facilities contained customary financial covenants  including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
borrowing rates under the credit facilities and now the amended credit facilities are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are based on libor or the prime rate publicly announced from time to time  in each case plus a specified interest rate margin 
the credit facilities were secured by substantially all of our assets 
we used proceeds from the credit facilities and other available cash to fund the tender offer for any and all of our senior notes  to retire our then existing senior secured credit facility due which had no amounts outstanding 
notes on march   we commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation  which we refer to as the cadmus tender offer  for any and all of the outstanding notes at total consideration equal to of outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon for notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by march  interest on the notes is payable semi annually on june and december with no required principal payments prior to maturity on june  in connection with the acquisition of cadmus  we recorded a million increase to the value of the notes to record them at their fair value  which fair value increase is being amortized over the life of the notes 
on march   we accepted for purchase and paid approximately million for the notes tendered in the cadmus tender offer  using million of delayed draw term loan funding under the amended credit facilities and cash on hand 
the merger of cadmus into cenveo was a change of control of cadmus under the notes indenture 
on march  and in connection with the foregoing change of control  we extended the scheduled expiration of the cadmus tender offer until april   modified the offer to purchase each note tendered for a price equal to of outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest  and waived certain consent related conditions  which we refer to as the change of control offer 
on april   we settled payment on all notes tendered under the change of control offer  and terminated the remaining amount of the delayed draw term loan facility under the amended credit facilities 
supplemental indentures we entered into supplemental indentures  dated march   july   august  and november  to the indenture dated june   among cadmus  each of the subsidiary guarantors as defined therein and us bank national association as successor trustee to wachovia bank  national association  as trustee  pursuant to which the notes were issued 
these supplemental indentures provide for  among other things  the assumption by us of the obligations of cadmus under the notes and such indenture and the addition of other us subsidiaries of ours  colorgraphics and its subsidiary  commercial envelope and its subsidiaries and other canadian subsidiaries of ours as guarantors of the notes 
simultaneously  we entered into supplemental indentures  dated march   july  and august   to the indenture dated february  among us  the guarantors named therein and us bank national association  as trustee  pursuant to which our notes were issued 
these supplemental indentures provide for  among other things  the addition of the us subsidiaries of cadmus  colorgraphics and its subsidiary and commercial envelope and its subsidiaries as guarantors of the notes 
notes in january  we issued our notes  which have semi annual interest payments due on june and december  and no required principal payments prior to maturity on december  we may redeem these notes  in whole or in part  on or after december   at redemption prices from to  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
senior notes on may   we retired the remaining million of our senior notes for of the principal amount plus accrued interest  which was funded with our revolving credit facility 
on june   we completed a tender offer and consent solicitation  which we refer to as the tender offer  for any and all of our million senior notes and extinguished approximately million in aggregate principal amount approximately of the outstanding amount that were tendered and accepted for purchase under the terms of the tender offer 
other debt other debt of approximately million at december   consists primarily of equipment loans assumed in the acquisition of cadmus  colorgraphics and commercial envelope 
of this debt  million had variable interest rates with an average interest rate of  while million had an average fixed interest rate of 
interest rate swaps in and  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure of million and million  respectively  of our notional floating rate debt 
our hedges of interest rate risk were designated and documented at inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly 
effectiveness of the hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the derivatives to hypothetical derivatives that would be a perfect hedge of floating rate debt 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges and the effect on our consolidated financial statements will depend on whether the hedge is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the liability hedged 
as of december   we do not anticipate reclassifying any ineffectiveness into our results of operations for the next twelve months 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements 
on december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million and a de minimis amount of surety bonds related to performance and payment guarantees 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
we extinguished an outstanding letter of credit of approximately million in connection with the debt we retired on april  our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency corporate rating amended credit facilities notes notes last update standard poor s bb bb b b december moody s b ba b b september on december   standard poor s raised our corporate rating to bb from b  the rating on the amended credit facilities to bb from bb  and the ratings on our notes and notes to b from b citing improvements in profitability  cash flow generation and success in integrating acquisitions and achieving synergies from those acquisitions 
on december   we signed an agreement to acquire of the outstanding stock of rex corporation  which we refer to as rex 
rex is one of the largest independent manufacturers of premium and high quality packaging solutions and generated annual revenues of approximately million for its most recently completed fiscal year 
the transaction is expected to be completed in march and currently expected to be funded using the revolving credit facility 
the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding 
we do not believe that our current ratings will impact our ability to raise additional capital 
we expect that internally generated cash flow and the financing available under our amended credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and short term growth through the end of  however  this cannot be assured

it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  as of december  and  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
guarantees 
in connection with the disposition of certain operations  we have indemnified the purchasers for certain contingencies as of the date of disposition 
we have accrued the estimated probable cost of these contingencies 
critical accounting matters the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based on the expected collectibility of our accounts receivable  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the current creditworthiness of customers and related aging of past due balances 
as of december  and  the allowance provided for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statement of operations were million in  million in and million in we cannot guarantee that our current credit losses will be consistent with those in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the allowance for losses required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  we would assess the fair value of the asset or asset group and if necessary  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
during  and  in connection with our restructuring program  we recorded impairment charges  net on long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
provision for impairment of goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill in the fourth quarter each year and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of each of our reporting units  which we estimate using either discounted cash flows or comparative market multiples 
in preparing projected future cash flows  we use our judgment in projecting the profitability of our reporting units  their growth in future years  investment and working capital requirements and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
in our comparisons to market multiples of other similar companies  we use judgment in the selection of the companies included in the analysis 
we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill  however  if our estimates of the valuations of our reporting units prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future years 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
our self insurance workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is adjusted from time to time to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed and discounted basis that considers anticipated payment patterns 
as of december   the undiscounted liability was million and the discounted liability was million using a discount rate 
workers compensation expense incurred in  and was million  million and million  respectively  and were based on actuarial estimates 
our self insured healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of december  we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries to determine an adequate liability for self insured plans 
this liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively  and was estimated based on an analysis of actuarial completion factors that estimated incurred but unreported liabilities derived from the historical claims experience 
our liability as of december  increased from the prior year  primarily due to the increase in our workforce resulting from the acquisitions 
the estimate of our liability for employee healthcare represents approximately days of unreported claims 
while we believe that the estimates of our self insurance liabilities are reasonable  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect the amount of workers compensation and healthcare expenses we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate which includes the us  canada and india 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities of million from our us operations 
as of december  and  we had foreign net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under sfas  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered our recent operating results and anticipated future taxable income in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our valuation allowance by approximately million to reflect the realization of deferred tax assets 
in connection with the acquisitions of printegra and commercial envelope  we released valuation allowance against goodwill in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the acquisitions of cadmus and colorgraphics  we increased our valuation allowance by million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we released all but million of these valuation allowances against goodwill 
in  we decreased our valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards principally against the gain on sale of supremex  which is reflected in discontinued operations 
as of december   the total valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets was million 
during  we increased our valuation allowance by million as a result of continuing operating losses from our us operations 
the remaining portion of our valuation allowance will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
when sufficient positive evidence occurs  our income tax expense will be reduced to the extent we decrease the amount of our valuation allowance 
the increase or reversal of all or a portion of our tax valuation allowance could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 
any reversal of the valuation allowance related to stock based compensation will be reflected as a component of shareholders equity and will not affect the future effective income tax rate 
new accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt certain new accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest rate fluctuations and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes 
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations 
the interest on this debt is libor plus a margin 
at december   we had variable rate debt outstanding of million  after considering our interest rate swaps 
a increase in libor on debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
we have foreign operations  primarily in canada  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended december   a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have resulted in a decrease in sales and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on future results would also be impacted by changes in sales levels or local currency prices
