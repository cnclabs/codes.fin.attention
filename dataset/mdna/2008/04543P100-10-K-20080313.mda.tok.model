table of contents kaulkin ginsberg  the future of receivables management and press release dated september and december  respectively 
references to the kaulkin ginsberg index for the third quarter of are to the press release dated december  company overview we have been purchasing and collecting defaulted or charged off accounts receivable portfolios from consumer credit originators since the formation of our predecessor company in charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers  consumer finance companies  healthcare providers  retail merchants  telecommunications and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we are able to purchase them at a substantial discount 
we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this affords us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize our profits 
during the twelve months ended december   we invested million net of buybacks in charged off consumer receivable portfolios  with an aggregate face value of billion  or of face value 
on average  prices we pay for charged off accounts receivable portfolios have remained elevated compared to historical pricing levels as a result of increased competition 
the higher prices we have paid for portfolios of charged off accounts receivable have led to us assigning lower average internal rates of return to recent purchases 
we believe that pricing began to moderate and decline slightly late into the latter half of  however  we cannot give any assurances about future prices either overall or within account or asset types 
we are determined to remain disciplined and purchase portfolios only when we believe we can achieve acceptable returns 
for the twelve months ended december   cash collections were million  an increase over the prior year period 
total revenues for the twelve months ended were million  a decrease from the prior year period 
the total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  was million  a increase over the prior year period 
the increase in total operating expenses is primarily due to increased collections expense 
collections expense was million  a increase over the prior year period 
collections expense increased as a percentage of cash collections to for the twelve months ended december  versus in the same period for several categories of collections expense increased  including court costs  telephone  letters and mailing costs and information acquisition expenses  related to an increase in the number of accounts under management and changes to collection strategies 
also  contingent fees paid to third parties increased primarily as a result of increased collections by other collection agencies collecting on our behalf 
during  we instituted an expanded and accelerated legal collection strategy 
this strategy has placed emphasis on the legal channel earlier in the collection process 
court costs have increased as more suits are filed 
we are currently exploring alternatives that will allow us to better match the court cost expenses with the associated cash collections 
net income was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to a net income of million for the same period in net income for the twelve months ended december  and included net impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
the net impairment charges reduced revenue and the carrying value of the purchased receivables 
during the year ended december   we completed a comprehensive review of our methods of forecasting future cash collections and believe we have improved our statistical forecasting model 
in addition to the improved collections forecast approach  based on our review  we have chosen to extend the lives on many portfolios acquired in and later  up to months 
the improved collections forecast and the extension of and later portfolio lives were accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 sfas no 

the revised collection forecasts and extension of portfolio lives contributed to a net impairment of million and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
yields on certain portfolios were adjusted upwards as a result of the extension of portfolio lives  however this adjustment did not have a material impact on revenue for the three and twelve months ended december  on april   we announced a recapitalization plan to return million to our shareholders through share repurchases and a special one time cash dividend 
during the second quarter of  we repurchased 
table of contents million shares for million with an average purchase price of per share 
furthermore  our board of directors declared a special one time cash dividend of per share  or million in aggregate  which was paid on july  to holders of record on july  the special one time cash dividend of million completed the million recapitalization 
to fund the return of capital to shareholders  we entered into a new credit agreement the new credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders named therein to provide a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility the term loan facility 
the term loan facility was funded on june  and was partially utilized to fund share repurchases during june the remainder of the term loan facility borrowings was used to pay the july  special one time cash dividend 
subsequent to the completion of the recapitalization plan  our interest expense will be significantly higher as a result of the borrowings incurred 
we incurred interest expense of million in the quarter ended december   and expect interest expense to remain at this level as a result of borrowings under the term loan facility 
interest expense could change as a result of fluctuations in interest rates or increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in september  we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement whereby  on a quarterly basis  we swap variable rates  equal to three month london interbank offered rate libor  for fixed rates  on the notional amount of million 
for the year ended december   the swap was determined to be effective in hedging against fluctuations in the fair value of the underlying debt 
as of december   the value of the swap had declined by million since entering into the swap and is reflected as a liability in our consolidated statements of financial position 
during  we closed our white marsh  maryland and wixom  michigan offices 
as part of this office consolidation  we recorded approximately million in pre tax restructuring charges for costs primarily related to associate one time termination benefits  contract termination costs for the remaining lease payments on the wixom  michigan office and other exit costs 
there was not a significant impact to the total number of associates because we transferred existing staff to  or increased staffing in other call center locations 
we expect our annual occupancy expenses to be lower than they would have been if we had kept these two offices open by approximately million beginning in industry overview the accounts receivable management industry is growing  driven by a number of industry trends  including increasing levels of consumer debt obligations according to the us federal reserve board  the consumer credit industry increased from billion of consumer debt obligations in to trillion of consumer debt obligations in november  a compound annual growth rate of 
according to the kaulkin ginsberg report  the amount of outstanding revolving and non revolving consumer credit has increased at a compound annual growth rate of from trillion in june to trillion in june increasing charge offs of the underlying receivables according to kaulkin ginsberg index for the third quarter of  beginning in the third quarter of  the pricing began to moderate from elevated pricing levels exhibited in the debt purchasing markets in recent years 
in addition  the charge off rate and the amount of outstanding consumer credit both increased in the third quarter of  indicating a favorable supply environment for debt purchasers 
however  the unemployment rate and the number of individual bankruptcy filings also rose in the third quarter of  indicating a more challenging collection environment as debtors have less resources available to satisfy their debt 
increasing types of credit originators accessing the debt sale market according to the kaulkin ginsberg report  credit card companies and consumer finance companies continue to offer the largest share of the portfolios for sale 
telecommunications  utilities and healthcare companies have increased their presence in the debt purchase market in recent years 
historically  credit originators have sought to limit credit losses either through using internal collection efforts with their own associates or outsourcing collection activities to third party collectors 
credit originators that 
table of contents outsource the collection of charged off receivables have typically remained committed to third party providers as a result of the perceived economic benefit of outsourcing and the resources required to establish the infrastructure required to support in house collection efforts 
the credit originator can pursue an outsourced solution by either selling its charged off receivables for immediate cash proceeds or by placing charged off receivables with a third party collector on a contingent fee basis while retaining ownership of the receivables 
in the event that a credit originator sells receivables to a debt purchaser such as us  the credit originator receives immediate cash proceeds and eliminates the costs and risks associated with internal recovery operations 
the purchase price for these charged off receivables are generally discounted more than from their face values  depending on the amount the purchaser anticipates it can recover and the anticipated effort required to recover that amount 
credit originators  as well as other holders of consumer debt  utilize a variety of processes to sell receivables  including the following competitive bids for specified portfolios through a sealed bid or  in some cases  an on line process  privately negotiated transactions between the credit originator or other holder of consumer debt and a purchaser  and forward flow contracts  which commit a debt seller to sell  and a purchaser to acquire  a steady flow of charged off consumer receivables periodically over a specified period of time  usually no less than three months  for a fixed percentage of the face value of the receivables 
we believe a debt purchaser s ability to successfully collect payments on charged off receivables  despite previous collection efforts by the credit originator or third party collection agencies  is driven by several factors  including the purchaser s ability to pursue collections over multi year periods  tailor repayment plans based on a consumer s ability to pay  and utilize experience and resources  including litigation

purchased receivable revenues reflect an amortization rate  or the difference between cash collections and revenue  of  an increase of  from the amortization rate of for the year ended december  the increased amortization rate is partially attributable to the net impairments of million  an increase of million  from net impairments of million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increased amortization rate is also due to lower average internal rates of return assigned to recent years purchases 
in addition  total revenues reflect a recognized gain on sale of purchased receivables during the year ended december  of million compared to a million gain during the year ended december  cash collections on charged off consumer receivables increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in

operating expenses are traditionally measured in relation to revenues 
however  we measure operating expenses in relation to cash collections 
we believe this is appropriate because of varying amortization rates  which is the difference between cash collections and revenues recognized  from period to period  due to seasonality of collections and other factors that can distort the analysis of operating expenses when measured against revenues 
additionally  we believe that the majority of operating expenses are variable in relation to cash collections 
salaries and benefits 
salary and benefit expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to salary and benefit expenses of million for the year ended december  salary and benefit expenses were of cash collections during compared with  for the same period in salary and benefit expenses decreased as a percentage of cash collections primarily due to a decrease in average overall associate headcount and increased productivity per full time equivalent associate  which is partially offset by increased incentive compensation associated with the increased productivity for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in we adopted fas r on january  adoption did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
since going public in  we had only granted stock options to certain key associates and non associate directors

table of contents information acquisition expenses 
the increase of million in the court costs and third party collection expenses were primarily due to changes in our collection strategies as well as an increase in the number of accounts for which legal and forwarding activities have been initiated 
the increase of million in contingent fees paid is due to higher contingent collections 
the increase of million in telephone was primarily due to changes in collection strategies 
the increase of million in letters and mailing and information acquisition is primarily due to the increased number of accounts as a result of purchasing in late and during during  we instituted an expanded and accelerated legal collection strategy

administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   reflecting a million  or  increase 
administrative expenses were of cash collections during compared with for the same period in administrative expenses increased as a percentage of cash collections primarily due to the one time property tax reversal for the year ended december  during  we determined that we would not be paying a previously probable accrual of property taxes for million and therefore we reversed the related expenses 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million for the year ended december  as a result of the sale of our white marsh  maryland office and for closing the wixom  michigan office during expenses were primarily related to associate one time termination benefits  contract termination costs for the remaining lease payments on the wixom  michigan office and other exit costs  which were partially offset by million proceeds received from the sale of the tangible assets located in the white marsh  maryland office

interest income was million during  reflecting a decrease of million compared to million interest income for the year ended december  interest income was as a percentage of cash collections during compared with for the same period in interest income decreased as a percentage of cash collections primarily due to lower cash balances compared to the prior year 
we expect interest income to be immaterial until the term loan facility is paid off

table of contents in september  we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement whereby  on a quarterly basis  we swap variable rates  equal to three month libor  for fixed rates  on the notional amount of million outstanding on our term loan facility 
this interest rate swap is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge and the effective portion of the gain or loss on such hedge is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements

seasonality our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections within portfolios tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections within portfolios tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level due to the application of the provisions prescribed by sop in addition  our operating results may be affected to a lesser extent by the timing of purchases of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with purchasing and integrating these receivables into our system 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter

we have traditionally used cash for acquisitions of purchased receivables  repayment of bank borrowings  purchasing property and equipment and working capital 
during  we had borrowings of million against our former credit agreement and new revolving credit facility for the funding of the investment in purchased receivables with repayments of million to reduce our outstanding former credit agreement balance  and we had borrowings of million on our new term loan facility beginning on june   with repayments of million to reduce our outstanding new term loan facility balance 
approximately half of the proceeds of the term loan facility were used to repurchase million shares of our common stock for million under the recapitalization plan during the second quarter of the remainder of the borrowing under the term loan facility was for payment of the special one time cash dividend on july  during the second quarter of  we acquired of the outstanding shares of parc for million 

table of contents borrowings we entered into a new credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders named therein  effective as of june   as part of our overall recapitalization plan

the credit facilities bear interest at prime or up to basis points over prime depending upon our liquidity  as defined in the new credit agreement 
alternately  at our discretion  we may borrow by entering into one  two  three  six or twelve month libor contracts at rates between to basis points over the respective libor rates  depending on our liquidity 
our revolving credit facility includes an accordion loan feature that allows us to request a million increase as well as sublimits for million of letters of credit and for million of swingline loans

the repayment of our excess cash flow is effective with the issuance of our annual audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year the repayment provisions are of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was less than or equal to to but greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  or if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to to as of the end of such fiscal year 
commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility are paid quarterly  in arrears  and are calculated as an amount equal to a margin of to  depending on our liquidity  on the average amount available on the revolving credit facility 
the new credit agreement requires us to effectively cap  collar or exchange interest rates on a notional amount of at least of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan 
we had million principal balance outstanding on our credit facilities at december  as described above  the company has an interest rate swap agreement that hedges a portion of the interest rate expense on the term loan facility 
we were not in compliance with one of the covenants of the new credit agreement as of december  we subsequently obtained a temporary compliance waiver from jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders named therein 
we  jpmorgan chase bank  na and other lenders entered into a first amendment to credit agreement the amendment  effective march  in respect of the new credit 
table of contents agreement 
we believe we are in compliance with all terms of the new credit agreement  as amended  as of december  the amendment resets two financial covenants and increases the rate of interest we pay on borrowings under the credit agreement by basis points percent 
the two financial covenants reset by the amendment are the leverage ratio  and the ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth 
the amendment also permanently waives the earlier default on the consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth covenant 
refer to note  subsequent event for further information 
termination of former credit agreement 
on june   the initial funding occurred under the new credit agreement and  as a result  our former credit agreement  dated as of september   as amended  with jpmorgan chase  na  as agent  and syndicate of lenders named therein the former credit agreement  which contained a million revolving credit facility  terminated 
the former credit agreement was scheduled to expire in may we incurred no penalties or prepayment premiums in connection with early termination of the former credit agreement 
cash flows the majority of our purchases have been funded with borrowings against our revolving credit facility and with internal cash flow 
for the year ended december   we invested million in purchased receivables  net of buybacks  while borrowing million against our credit facilities 
the million drawn on the credit facilities includes million of borrowings against our new revolving credit facility as of december  for the funding of the investment purchased receivables 
also included in the million borrowings were million to fund the recapitalization transactions related to the shares repurchased and special one time cash dividend 
our cash balance has decreased from million at december  to million as of december  our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and were generated primarily from net income earned through cash collections 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used for investing purposes was primarily due to acquisitions of purchased receivables  net of cash collections applied to principal and purchases of property and equipment 
additionally  in we used million to acquire parc  net of cash acquired 
financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  and financing activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to borrowings of million under our credit facilities and former credit agreement to fund the recapitalization transactions and investments in purchased receivables 
the cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by million repayment on our former credit agreement  new credit facilities and capital lease obligations as well as payments of million for our repurchase of million shares in accordance with the recapitalization plan 
furthermore  our board of directors declared a special one time cash dividend of per share  or million in aggregate  which was paid on july  to holders of record on july  also  we exercised our right to buy shares from our former associates for per share  or million 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to the million repurchase of million shares in accordance with the stock repurchase program  which was a considerable portion of the million repurchase of million shares  as well as the million repayment of parc s loan balances on the date of acquisition  which was partially offset by million of borrowings against the former credit agreement to fund the investment in purchased receivables 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to repayments on capital lease obligations 
we believe that cash generated from operations combined with borrowing available under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in the future  if we need additional capital for investment in purchased receivables  working capital or to 
table of contents grow our business or acquire other businesses  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or we may seek to increase the availability under our revolving credit facility 
future contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  year ending december  thereafter capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchased receivables revolving credit term loan total future minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations have been reduced by the amount of our restructuring activities that relates to the leased equipment or facilities 
during  we renewed three forward flow contracts  entered into six new forward flow contracts as well as maintained two on going forward flow contracts that commit us to purchase receivables for a fixed percentage of the face amount of the receivables 
nine forward flow contracts have terms beyond december  with the last contract expiring in december nine forward flow contracts have estimated monthly purchases of approximately million  depending upon circumstances  and the other two on going forward flow contracts have estimated monthly purchases of approximately  over the next twelve months 
to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our revolving credit facility  it would be due in june or earlier as defined in the new credit agreement 
to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our term loan facility  it would be due in june off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we utilize the interest method of accounting for our purchased receivables because we believe that the amounts and timing of cash collections for our purchased receivables can be reasonably estimated 
this belief is predicated on our historical results and our knowledge of the industry 
the interest method is prescribed by the accounting standards executive committee statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
we adopted the provisions of sop in january and apply sop to purchased receivables acquired after december  the provisions of sop that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend previously followed guidance  the accounting standards executive committee practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans  for consistent treatment and apply prospectively to purchased receivables acquired before january  we purchase pools of homogenous accounts receivable and record each pool at its acquisition cost 
pools purchased after may be aggregated into one or more static pools within each quarter  based on common risk characteristics 
risk characteristics of purchased receivables are generally considered to be similar since purchased receivables are usually in the late stages of the post charged off collection cycle 
we therefore aggregate most pools purchased within each quarter 
pools purchased before may not be aggregated with other pool purchases 
each static pool  either aggregated or non aggregated  retains its own identity and does not change over the remainder of its life 
each static pool is accounted for as a single unit for recognition of revenue  principal payments and impairments 

table of contents each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an internal rate of return irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows 
the irr is applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts to determine the revenue recognized 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
to the extent there are differences in actual performance versus expected performance  the irr is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
effective january  under sop  if the revised cash flow estimates are less than the original estimates  the irr remains unchanged and an impairment is recognized 
if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  reversal of the previously recognized impairment is made prior to any increases to the irr 
the cost recovery method prescribed by sop is used when collections on a particular portfolio cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until we have fully collected the cost of the portfolio 
application of the interest method of accounting requires the use of estimates  primarily estimated remaining collections  to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are primarily based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than the remaining collections estimate  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and result in an impairment being recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk with our credit facilities 
we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate exposure associated with our outstanding debt 
the outstanding borrowings on our former credit agreement and our new credit facilities were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
in september  we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement whereby  on a quarterly basis  we swap variable rates equal to three month libor for fixed rates on the notional amount of million 
every year thereafter  on the anniversary of the swap agreement the notional amount will decrease by million 
the outstanding unhedged borrowings on our new credit facilities were million for the year ended december   consisting of million outstanding on the revolving credit facility and million outstanding on the term loan facility 
interest rates on unhedged borrowings may be based on the prime rate or libor  at our discretion 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates  interest expense would have increased approximately million for the year ended december  and less than million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the estimated increase in interest expense assumes no changes in the volume or composition of the debt 
the hedged borrowings on our new credit facilities were million at december  for the quarter ended december   the swap was determined to be effective in hedging against fluctuations in the fair value of the underlying debt 
if the swap rate increased by basis points over the remaining term of the swap  the value of the swap asset would have been million 
conversely  if the swap rate decreased by basis points over the remaining term of the swap  the value of the swap liability would have increased by approximately million to million 
as of december   the company does not have any fair value hedges 
interest rate fluctuations do not have a material impact on interest income
