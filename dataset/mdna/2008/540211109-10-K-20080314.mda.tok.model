item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere herein 
executive overview during  we transformed our company from a company historically focused on movies and entertainment to an organization that is now the largest provider of interactive media  and connectivity solutions to the hospitality and healthcare industries 
we continue to build upon our corporate strategy of expanding our networks and integrating additional market valued solutions 
in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets of stayonline  inc  a leading provider of broadband solutions focused on the lodging industry  which presents an opportunity to drive additional revenue streams through our customer base by providing broadband internet solutions and services one of the most highly demanded services of the business traveler 
the combination of stayonline s expertise and industry relationships  with our significant resources and hotel relationships  will allow us to enhance the array of broadband solutions we can deliver to our customers  all backed by our nationwide customer service organization 
lodgenet interactive corporation form k 
table of contents another significant step that expands our networks to a broader range of solutions for our customers was our acquisition of on command corporation on command 
on april   we acquired  for million  of the capital stock of ascent entertainment group  inc ascent  which was a wholly owned subsidiary of liberty satellite 
ascent owned of the capital stock of on command 
this acquisition expands the benefits that we can bring to our hospitality customers 
on command provides interactive media services to approximately  hotel rooms throughout the united states  canada  and mexico 
it also owned of the capital stock of the hotel networks  inc  thn a distributor of advertising supported  satellite delivered television programming to approximately  rooms throughout the united states 
in july of  we acquired the remaining interest of thn 
during  we initiated and substantially completed a plan to integrate the acquisitions into lodgenet 
as a result of our transformation into interactive media  and connectivity services  in early  we changed the name of lodgenet entertainment corporation to lodgenet interactive corporation 
for  we achieved revenue of million  an increase of million over our net loss of million or per share basic and diluted included post acquisition costs of million for restructuring  integration  and amortization of acquired intangibles and a million one time charge for debt refinancing 
we have increased total rooms by to almost million  more than doubled the digital rooms to approximately million  doubled the number of cable programming rooms served  expanded high definition hd rooms by more than two and a half times to  and increased broadband internet rooms by almost five fold to  we also added advertising media services into approximately  rooms  and expanded our healthcare base to more than facilities 
our strategic transformation places us in a unique position to deepen our customer relationships and drive new revenues 
leveraging on the significant benefits of our accelerated integration  we believe we are positioned to drive additional operational efficiencies and diversify our revenues by focusing on delivering high definition television  broadband internet  and professional and advertising media solutions across our expanding customer base in and beyond 
for  our guest pay revenue  which includes guest entertainment purchases and contracted revenue from hotels for services such as basic and premium programming television channels and broadband internet connectivity  increased million or to million 
other revenue  which includes healthcare  advertising and media services thn  broadband and interactive television system sales  increased to million during versus million in the increase was a direct result of the acquisitions previously discussed and our business diversification initiatives 
total direct costs exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization discussed separately below were million  an increase of million as compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  direct costs related to guest entertainment programming and hotel commissions remained flat year over year 
the increase in total direct costs to in as compared to last year was driven by two primary components  the lower margin inherent in the broadband business and higher programming costs related to the on command basic and premium television programming business 
we expect to eliminate these discounts and reverse the lower margins as certain hotel sites are upgraded to high definition television capabilities 
the balance of the increase is from nominal increases to programming costs and hotel commissions 
as a result of the acquisitions  guest pay operations expenses increased to million in compared to million in guest pay operations expenses included million of integration related expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  guest pay operations expenses were this year compared to in per average installed room  operations expenses decreased to per room per month compared to in the prior year

also included within this year s sg a expenses were approximately million of integration expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses were in the current year compared to in sg a expenses per average installed room were in compared to per average installed room in in conjunction with our acquisitions  we initiated a restructuring and integration plan during with the goal of eliminating duplicative functions and achieving greater operating efficiencies see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we incurred restructuring costs of million during the year 
the restructuring expenses were related to employee severance costs for consolidation of administrative  sales  engineering  marketing  programming and technical operations departments  consolidation of warehouse and manufacturing facilities  and consolidation of our call center operations 
lodgenet interactive corporation form k 
table of contents our cash and liquidity position remained stable through the acquisitions and accelerated restructuring and integration activities 
we ended the year with cash of million and we are in compliance with all bank covenants 
for the year  cash provided by operating activities was million  which was reduced by million of cash used primarily for acquisition refinancing  restructuring and integration related activities 
we used cash for property and equipment additions  including growth related capital of million 
in addition  cash used for the acquisition investments was million  which was primarily funded from our debt refinancing 
core businesses guest pay interactive services includes guest entertainment purchases and revenue from hotels for services such as free to guest television channels and broadband internet connectivity 
our primary source of revenue is providing in room  interactive television services to the lodging industry  for which the hotel guest pays on a per view  hourly or daily basis 
our services include on demand movies  network based video games  music and music videos  internet on television which does not require a laptop  and television on demand programming 
our total guest generated revenue depends on a number of factors  including the number of rooms on our network 
we can increase revenue over time by increasing the number of rooms served by our interactive television systems 
our ability to expand our room base is dependent on a number of factors  including the attractiveness of our technology  service and support to hotels currently operating without an interactive television system  newly constructed hotel properties  and hotels with expiring contracts that may not meet our return on investment requirement and may select programming from a local cable provider 
the variety of services offered at the hotel 
rooms equipped with our high definition or standard digital system generate higher revenue than rooms equipped with our tape based system primarily because they offer a greater variety of services and content choices 
we plan to continue to grow the revenue we generate per average room by the installation of our hdtv system in all newly contracted rooms and by converting selected rooms to our hdtv system in exchange for long term contract extensions 
the popularity  timeliness and amount of content offered at the hotel 
our revenues vary to a certain degree with the number  timeliness and popularity of movie content available for viewing 
historically  a decrease in the availability of popular movie content has adversely impacted revenue 
although not completely within our control  we seek to program and promote the most popular available movie content and other content to maximize revenue and gross profit 
the price of the service purchased by the hotel guest 
generally  we control the prices charged for our products and services and manage pricing in an effort to maximize revenue and overall gross profit 
we establish pricing based on such things as the demographics of the property served  the popularity of the content and overall general economic conditions 
our technology enables us to measure the popularity of our content and make decisions to best position such content and optimize revenue from such content 
the occupancy rate at the property 
our revenue also varies depending on hotel occupancy rates  which are subject to a number of factors  including seasonality  general economic conditions and world events  such as terrorist threats or public health issues 
occupancy rates for the properties we serve are typically higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
we target higher occupancy properties in diverse demographic and geographic locations in an effort to mitigate occupancy related risks

table of contents the primary direct costs of providing guest pay interactive services are license fees paid to major motion picture studios  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for non exclusive distribution rights of recently released major motion pictures  commissions paid to our hotel customers  which are also based on a percent of guest generated revenue  fixed monthly programming charges paid primarily to directv for satellite delivered basic and premium television programming  broadband internet connectivity costs and call center support  license fees  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for television on demand  music  music video  video games and sports programming  and one time license fees paid for independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences 
other products and services 
our revenue from other services increased million to million during versus million in the increase was a direct result of our initiatives to diversify our revenue including the expansion of our advertising and media services  increased broadband equipment and interactive television system equipment sales to hotels  increased equipment sales to health care facilities and increased equipment sales to travel centers 
the advertising and media revenue was generated primarily by the hotel networks  a subsidiary acquired as part of the on command acquisition 
revenue generated from other products and services includes the following revenue generated from our advertising and media services  revenue generated from the sale of our guest pay interactive systems to healthcare facilities  along with recurring support for interactive content  software maintenance and technical field service for a fixed fee  revenue generated from the sale of our guest pay interactive systems to hotels  along with recurring support for interactive content  software maintenance and technical field service for a fixed fee  revenue from the sale of miscellaneous system equipment such as multi service connection equipment  television remotes and service parts and labor  revenues from the sale of equipment to our international licensees  revenues from the installation of master antenna low voltage wiring and related infrastructure  revenues from the sale and installation of directv satellite systems  and revenue generated from delivery of satellite basic and premium television programming for which the hotel pays us a fixed monthly charge per room

table of contents key metrics special note regarding the use of non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we use net free cash flow  a non gaap measure that is derived from results based on gaap 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation of  or as a substitute for  results prepared in accordance with gaap 
we define net free cash flow  a non gaap measure  as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for certain investing activities and excluding consideration paid for acquisitions 
net free cash flow is a key liquidity measure but should not be construed as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of our profitability or performance 
we provide information about net free cash flow because we believe it is a useful way for us  and our investors  to measure our ability to satisfy cash needs  including interest payments on our debt  taxes and capital expenditures 
gaap requires us to provide information about cash flow generated from operations 
however  gaap cash flow from operations is reduced by the amount of interest and tax payments and also takes into account changes in net current liabilities eg  changes in working capital that do not impact net income 
because changes in working capital can reverse in subsequent periods  and because we want to provide information about cash available to satisfy interest and income tax expense by showing our cash flows before deducting interest and income tax expense  we are also presenting net free cash flow information 
our definition of net free cash flow does not take into account our working capital requirements  debt service requirements or other commitments 
accordingly  net free cash flow is not necessarily indicative of amounts of cash that may be available to us for discretionary purposes 
our method of computing net free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
a reconciliation of net free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities is provided as follows in thousands of dollars net free cash flow add cash used for property and equipment additions cash used for acquisitions and other activities cash provided by operating activities free cash flow in addition to increasing revenue and controlling expenses  we can manage our actions related to this goal by reducing the per room installation cost of a hdtv or digital room and by varying the number of rooms we install with the hdtv or digital system in any given period 
during  cash expenditures for our acquisition activities included million for acquisition investments and million of cash used primarily for acquisition refinancing  restructuring and integration related activities 
levels of net free cash flow are set forth in the following table in thousands of dollars cash provided by operating activities property and equipment additions cash used for acquisitions and other activities cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   included million of cash used for acquisition refinancing  restructuring and integration including million for the redemption of our senior notes 
cash used for acquisition activities related to the acquisitions of on command  thn and stayonline

table of contents capital investment including expansion capital  which we define as capital used for new room installations  is set forth in the following table in thousands of dollars expansion capital investment renewal investment corporate capital and minor extensions capital investment to install newly contracted rooms with our digital or hdtv system 
capital investment to convert rooms to our digital or hdtv system in exchange for long term contact extensions 
capital investment for corporate infrastructure including computers  equipment  software development and minor system upgrades 
rooms served one of the metrics we monitor is the growth  net of de installations  of our interactive television network 
during  our room base increased by more than  rooms  primarily from the acquisition of on command 
over the last five years  de installation activity averaged approximately of our total installed room base 
as lower revenue tape based systems come up for contract renewal the overall economics may not support upgrading the site to our hdtv system 
in these situations  many properties decide to switch to their local cable provider or we may elect to remove a certain number of these sites from our interactive television room base 
we expect this trend to continue as we focus on the quality of rooms installed and upgraded with an objective of greater returns when investing our capital dollars 
we installed our systems in the following number of net new rooms and had the following total rooms installed as of december total rooms served total guest pay interactive rooms hd rooms total cable programming ftg rooms total broadband internet rooms net new guest pay interactive rooms total rooms served include interactive television rooms  rooms served by international licensees  properties receiving only basic and premium television services and properties receiving only broadband services 
the increase from is due to the addition of the on command room base of approximately  rooms 
interactive rooms are equipped with our interactive television systems 
hd rooms are equipped with high definition capabilities 
cable programming rooms receiving basic or premium television programming

table of contents high definition and digital room growth we continue to expand our digital base  including high definition television hdtv  as we install our hdtv system in newly contracted rooms and convert select rooms to the hdtv system in exchange for long term contract extensions 
rooms equipped with our digital or hdtv system typically generate higher revenue since the range of services is greater than rooms equipped with our tape based systems 
total digital rooms installed digital rooms as a percent of total guest pay interactive rooms net new digital rooms installed total hdtv rooms installed hdtv rooms are equipped with high definition capabilities and are included in total digital rooms 
capital investment per room the average investment per room associated with a digital installation can fluctuate due to engineering efforts  component costs  product segmentation  cost of assembly and installation  average property size  certain fixed costs  hotel capital contributions and the expanding number of high definition installations  which have a higher cost per room 
the following table sets forth our average installation and conversion investment cost per room during the years ended december average cost per room new installation average cost per room conversion average cost per hd room new installation average cost per hd room conversion the increase in the average cost per new room from to is primarily driven by the decrease in average number of rooms per property and the increase in high definition installations  which have a higher equipment cost per room 
the incremental cost for a high definition installation ranges from approximately to per room depending upon the average number of rooms per property  the mix of high definition services and the amount of capital contributed by the hotel 
revenue per room guest entertainment revenue can fluctuate based on several factors including the popularity of movie content  mix of movies purchased and the availability and popularity of free alternative programming 
the following table sets forth the components of our guest entertainment revenue per room for the years ended december average monthly revenue per room movie revenue other interactive service revenue total per guest pay room certain contracts within our acquired on command customer base included discounts for satellite delivered basic and premium television programming which negatively impacted other interactive service revenue 
we expect to eliminate these discounts as the sites are upgraded to high definition television capabilities

guest entertainment direct costs related to hotel services increased by basis points over and were driven by two primary components  basis points were associated with our acquired broadband internet business  and basis points were associated with the lower margins related to the on command basic and premium television programming business

interest 
at december   we had debt totaling million with an all in weighted average interest rate of 
we have two interest rate swap agreements with notional values of million at a rate of and million  at a rate of  both of which expire in june in addition  we entered into a million notional amount swap in november  at a rate of  which expires in december after giving effect to the interest rate swap arrangements  we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows  if effective 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase to interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by an estimated million 
the impact on earnings and cash flow for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase to interest rates would be approximately  assuming other variables remain constant 
economic condition 
our results are closely connected to the performance of the lodging industry  where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy resulting from business  general economic  or other events  such as a recession in the us  significant international crises  acts of terrorism  war or public health issues  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the overall travel industry can be  and has been in the past  adversely affected by weaker general economic climates  geopolitical instability and concerns about public health 
foreign currency transactions 
a portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of guest entertainment services in canada and mexico 
the results of operations and financial position of our operations in canada and mexico are measured in their local currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in canada and mexico are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses and liabilities are generally incurred in the local currency 
the reported income of our canadian and mexican subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency 
additionally  a portion of our assets are based in canada and mexico and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  our consolidated assets will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency
