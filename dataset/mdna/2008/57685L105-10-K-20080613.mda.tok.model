table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company develops  produces  markets and sells innovative  over the counter otc healthcare products with an emphasis on those that utilize unique  novel and or proprietary delivery systems that provide consumers with better ways to get better 
the company currently markets its products within the billion overall cough and cold category at retail 
our zicam products are sold in the cold nasal delivery products and oral delivery products  allergy sinus zicam nasal delivery  cough cough spray and rapidmelt tablets  and multi symptom relief oral delivery products market groups of the overall cough and cold category 
our nasal comfort products are generally sold within the space allocated for allergy and sinus products at retail 
we expect that our mix of products sold will change due to seasonality and varying growth rates within the market groups 
our products are currently available at all of the major food  drug  and mass merchant retailers 
the following table details our sales by product class  for the periods indicated  with further details below months ended months ended months ended months ended product class march  march  december  december  cold remedy allergy sinus nasal comfort cough multi symptom cold flu antacid total net sales because of the extreme seasonality of our business  our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year in order to better align our operations and financial results with the entire cold season our previous fiscal years ended in the middle of the cold season 
due to the change in our fiscal year  the three months ended march   are reported as a transition period 
our new fiscal year began april  and ended march  as in prior years  we believe the quarter ending june th our new fiscal first quarter will result in a net loss 
net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to approximately million  or above net sales of million for the twelve months ended march  the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to sales of our new multi symptom relief products  which began shipping during our fiscal second quarter ended september  
sales of allergy sinus products grew million  or  during the year  while sales of our cough products declined million  or  compared to the comparable period in the prior year 
the decrease in sales of cough products relates to the discontinuation of several of the original cough spray products 
during fiscal  we experienced a change in inventory management practices with certain of our large national retailers 
this change reduced the amount of inventory these retailers carried  as well as the size of pre season inventory purchases  compared to prior years 
we anticipate retailers will continue to improve their inventory management practices and we expect our sales to retailers will more closely mirror retail sales of our products to consumers 
we expect the zicam brand will continue to grow as we grow consumer awareness of our products  increase distribution of our products  and introduce new items 
net income for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended march  the increase in net income is primarily attributable to a decrease in selling  general and administrative sg a expense and  to a lesser degree  higher net sales 
the decreased sg a expense was related to reductions in legal expense related to product liability litigation see item legal proceedings 
product liability defense costs decreased to million net of  for insurance reimbursements for the fiscal year ended march   compared to million for the twelve months ended march  net of million for insurance reimbursements 
we anticipate legal defense costs will be  to  per quarter during fiscal 
table of contents we expect net income loss in future periods to be significantly affected by the level of sales  the timing and amount of our advertising  research and development expenses  and the timing and amount of expenses incurred in defense of product liability litigation matters 
expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different in future periods than the amounts incurred in the same period in earlier years 
we expect that advertising expenses will be highest during the cold season third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we anticipate quarterly earnings will continue to vary along with the seasonality of sales and the level of marketing and research and development expense 
as in prior years  we expect to report a loss in the quarter ending june the company s management reviews several key indicators in evaluating overall performance we compare our year to date sales and net income performance against our stated annual goal for each 
for fiscal  our goal was to grow sales to above the million recorded for the trailing twelve months ended march  million million  and to increase net income to the range of million to million  compared to million for the twelve months ended march  however  the cold season had an unusually slow start and the incidence of colds and flu in the general population was tracking at the lowest levels since zicam was introduced in we believe the change in inventory management practices by certain customers  the slow start to the cold season  and the low level of illness is reflected in the lower level of sales growth realized during the year 
due to decreased sg a expense  we realized net income of million in fiscal  which was in line with our original goal 
we monitor our share of the cough and cold market 
for the weeks ended march   retail sales of our products as measured by three outlet syndicated scanner data  not including our largest customer  wal mart increased approximately over the comparable period in the previous year  while the entire cough and cold category increased approximately over the same period 
the increased sales of our products for the weeks ended march  resulted in zicam products achieving a dollar share of the category versus in the prior year period 
we measure our ability to maintain strong gross margins on our products 
during fiscal  we realized an average gross margin of  comparable to the average gross margin achieved in the twelve months ended march   but below our goal of to gross margins on our existing products vary between and 
average gross margins were negatively impacted by returns of discontinued items and the mix of products sold  primarily related to sales of our new multi symptom products that are sold at prices below our cold remedy and allergy sinus products 
we are attempting to identify ways to improve gross margin on the new multi symptom products in the future 
additionally  average gross margins were negatively impacted by a million increase to our inventory reserve in excess of our customary amount  to account for expiring products and obsolete components 
we evaluate our operating performance by reviewing  over time  our ability to decrease selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
for the fiscal year ended march   our operating expenses excluding r d and product liability litigation related charges were approximately of our net sales compared to in the twelve months ended march  we review the distribution and mix of our products by key national retailers 
our ten largest retail customers account for a substantial majority of our annual sales  and we encourage our largest customers to carry a mix of our highest selling products 
retailers generally reset their cough and cold sections during the third calendar quarter of each year  at which time they add new products 
we encourage retailers to replace discontinued items with new zicam products 
seasonality and quarterly results the products we currently market are seasonal in nature  and sales at retail generally increase as the level of population suffering from colds rises 
the company records sales when we ship products from our warehouse facilities 
during the second fiscal quarter  the company usually realizes increased sales volume as retailers stock 
table of contents our products and order displays to prepare for the upcoming cough and cold season 
additional sales reorders to retailers are highly dependent upon the incidence of illness within the population 
retail consumption of our products is highest during the cough and cold season  which usually runs from october through march 
the company begins extensive advertising campaigns to coincide with the cough and cold season and generally realizes higher advertising expense in the october through march timeframe 
the fiscal first quarter ending june th of each year generally accounts for to of annual sales and  historically  we have incurred a loss in that quarter 
further  the company records the expense for annual bonus awards when goal attainment for the bonus is reached  which is generally reflected in the fiscal fourth quarter results 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any single quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with genarally accepted accounting principles gaap applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition  accounting for sales returns and allowances  accounting for sales discounts and promotional programs  and accounting for legal contingencies 
intangible assets and goodwill we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the zicam  llc interest acquired from zensano  inc in december under sfas no 
 goodwill must be tested when a triggering event occurs or at least annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss 
factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share  a general decline in zicam product sales  higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters 
any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of zicam  llc  or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting zicam  llc  could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our annual valuation of goodwill was completed in september  and no impairment was identified 
no triggering events have occurred subsequent to the valuation performed in the third quarter of calendar income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for the year and will continue to do so in future periods 
in fiscal and the three months ended march   we recognized a tax benefit related to the charitable donation of products 
in fiscal  we fully utilized the tax loss carryforward from prior years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when earned  that is  when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
sales incentives  promotional allowances  and returns are estimated and recognized at the date of shipment based upon historical activity and current agreements with customers 
the company evaluates these estimates on a monthly basis and revises them as necessary 
customer sales returns and allowances the estimate for product returns reflects our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects potential product returns 
prior to july  we recorded a returns provision of for products in distribution longer than one year and for new items 
we regularly review the similarities and differences of the new products relative to products for which we now have several years of product return experience 
in july  we adjusted our returns provision to of gross sales for all of our products  including the new items that began shipping in the third quarter of additionally  during calendar  we recorded a million adjustment to our returns provision to account for increased returns of nasal comfort and discontinued products from a large customer 
during the fiscal year ended march   we experienced product returns associated with discontinued items and we recorded a million adjustment to our returns provision  in excess of our customary of gross sales  to account for the increased returns of discontinued products which included several of our cough and flu products 
we will continue to review the return provision at least quarterly and adjust the reserve amounts as actual product return experience continues to develop 
additionally  when a determination is made that a product will be discontinued  we will adjust the returns provision 
should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates  our operating and financial results would be materially affected 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable 
the allowance is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects the amount of the company s probable credit losses 
during the quarter ended june   the company reviewed the allowance and based on historical performance elected to reduce its accrual rate from of gross sales to of gross sales  effective april  in addition  during the quarter ended june   the company reduced its allowance by approximately  which was reflected in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of income for the year ended march  insurance reimbursements during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded approximately  in expected reimbursement from our insurance carriers 
the reimbursement relates to product liability litigation defense costs 
we believe the amounts are reasonable based on the terms of the respective policies and the costs incurred to date 
we do not expect any additional reimbursements from our insurance carriers for legal expenses incurred in fiscal or any future periods to be sizable 
see part i  item legal proceedings for additional information regarding our insurance program 
legal contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business 
see part i  item legal proceedings for information regarding our pending and threatened litigation and our reserves for product liability litigation 
while we are vigorously defending ourself in these proceedings  the outcome of these and any other proceedings that may arise cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company follows the guidance of sfas  accounting for contingencies  which states that the company is required to accrue a contingent loss when the loss is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

sales have been affected by retailers maintaining a lower level of inventory and more closely aligning their repurchases with retail consumption during the cold season 
during the quarter ended september   we initiated a price increase for our cold remedy products 
this is the first price increase since zicam products were introduced in our new multi symptom products which began shipping during the second fiscal quarter have a selling price that is below the selling price of all of our other products 
we are evaluating our current pricing structure and anticipate raising prices on certain of our products during fiscal the average net selling price per unit  for the year ended march   was comparable to the average net selling price per unit in the twelve months ended march  cost of sales for the year ended march   our cost of sales increased approximately  to approximately million  compared to the cost of sales for the year ended march  of approximately million

additionally  there was approximately million of additional expense incurred in the twelve months ended march  associated with a charitable donation of short dated products 
charitable donations of products during fiscal were approximately  also  during fiscal  we determined that our allowance for bad debt exceeded the amount of loss that would likely be incurred and we reduced the allowance amount by approximately  which reduced sg a expenses by an equal amount 
lower sg a expense was also due to a  decrease in marketing expenses  primarily related to significant decreases in marketing expense associated with nasal comfort  offset by increased marketing associated with the xcid antacid introduction 
due to the change in the company s fiscal year  we believe advertising expenses can be better managed across the entire cold season to increase consumer awareness of our products and we expect to spread our advertising across the entire cold season during fiscal offsetting those sg a decreases was a  increase in sales expense associated with hiring and training our new trade sales force to call on national and regional retail accounts  wholesale distribution companies  and to oversee brokers 
in addition  labor expense increased approximately  due to increased headcount

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to our variable rate revolving line of credit with comerica bank 
in july  we borrowed million against our credit facility with comerica bank 
the primary purpose for the borrowing was to provide additional liquidity as we built inventory for expected increases in sales during the second half of we generally extend payment terms for customers during the third calendar quarter as customers purchase new products and build inventory for the upcoming cough and cold season 
we repaid the debt in the fourth calendar quarter of and ended fiscal with no debt 
we did not have any borrowings during the transition quarter ended march  or the fiscal year ended march  consequently  we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future 
as of march   we did not participate in any market risk sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases of which there were none in the year ended march  or commodity price risk 

table of contents as we continue to develop plans to initiate international sales  beginning in canada in  we will evaluate whether will be subject to currency exchange risk in any material way 
we do not anticipate using derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
if the volume of international business grows  we will assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into additional derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk
