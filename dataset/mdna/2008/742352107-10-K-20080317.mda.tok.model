item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the princeton review provides educational products and services to students  parents  educators and educational institutions 
these products and services include integrated classroom based and online instruction  professional development for teachers and educators  print and online materials and lessons  and higher education marketing 
we operate our businesses through three divisions  which correspond to our business segments 
the test preparation services division derives the majority of its revenue from classroom based and princeton review online test preparation courses and tutoring services 
additionally  test preparation services receives royalties from its independent franchisees who provide classroom based courses under the princeton review brand 
this division has historically accounted for the majority of our overall revenue and accounted for approximately of our overall revenue in the k services division provides a number of services to k schools and school districts  including assessment  professional development  intervention materials workbooks and related products and face to face instruction 
as a result of the increased emphasis on accountability and the measurement of student performance 
table of contents in public schools in this country and the centralization of school districts purchasing of assessment  professional development and supplemental educational products and services  this division continues to see growing demand by the public school market for its products 
the k services division enters into multiple element contracts with schools  school districts  municipal agencies  and other governmental bodies  requiring us to deliver a combination of products and services  including online and print based assessment  professional development  and face to face instruction 
these contracts therefore present several types of risks and uncertainties  including reducing our ability to effectively predict our operating performance  increasing variability in our cash balances and increasing credit risk 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail under the heading risk factors in this annual report on form k 
while we see continued strong demand for our k products and services  operating results are difficult to predict accurately  due to the foregoing factors and the fact that each contract entered into by this division has its own  unique product mix 
because our various products in this division have different gross margins professional development and live course instruction products typically have lower gross margins than fees for assessment products and printed materials  contracts with varying product mix could significantly alter this division s operating results from period to period 
in addition  this division faces challenges related to its rapid growth  including building a first class customer support organization  continually improving quality control processes for customized product and developing better project management tools 
the supplemental educational services ses division  previously included within our test preparation services division  delivers state aligned research based academic tutoring instruction designed to increase the academic achievement of students in schools in need of improvement in school districts throughout the country 
our customized services offer students intensive  live instruction related to math and english language arts including reading within a small group setting 
ses providers in a state are approved by the state s board of education 
title schools in the state may then offer that ses provider s services to students on free and reduced lunch programs 
districts send an annual notice to eligible parents about all of the providers approved to serve the districts 
parents choose providers for their children and sign an agreement with that provider 
districts and the state s board of education monitor the services and compliance 
the division was separated from the test preparation services division in as a result of its growth and management changes made in the fourth quarter of the financial results related to revenue and cost of revenue were recasted for the years ended december  and it was impractical to recast those results for the year ended december  our admissions services division  which was sold in february  has been reclassified as a discontinued operation throughout the periods discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as described under business acquisitions and dispositions  during february  we sold the subscription based admissions and application management services business  having reached the conclusion that this line of business could not be grown profitably on a long term basis and was non strategic to our overall educational services businesses 
the sale added cash to our balance sheet  lowered certain corporate support costs and enhanced focus on our core strength of working with students 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may we entered into an agreement with higher edge marketing services  inc  an entity formed by young shin  the former general manager of the admissions services division  pursuant to which sales  support  collection  marketing and related functions involved in our higher education institution marketing business were outsourced to higher edge  in exchange for a revenue sharing arrangement 
during and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  in revenue from the marketing services that are the subject of this transaction 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   total revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in retail revenue increased by million  primarily due to a shift to small group and individual tutoring revenue 
tutoring revenue for the sat and act increased by million 
retail graduate course revenues increased by million while a slight decrease in graduate classroom based instruction was offset by higher tutoring revenue 
institutional revenues were flat compared to this increase was partially offset by decreased revenue related to the higher education institutional marketing business revenue sharing arrangement offset the growth in course generated revenue 
the effect of the revenue sharing arrangement was to decrease revenues by million or of test preparation services revenue 
ses revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in ses revenues are the result of higher revenues in new york and chicago and new contracts in florida in k services revenue decreased million  or from million in to million in primarily due to intervention and professional development revenues due to loss of some significant customers offset by new significant assessment contracts and the deferral of assessment revenues from the fourth quarter of into as a result of delaying the revenue recognition for a large contract for testing due to the inability to obtain final customer approvals before year end 
cost of revenue for the year ended december   total cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is due to an increase in teacher pay of million because of higher teacher pay rates together with increased tutoring pay to support higher levels of tutoring revenue 
higher costs for course materials and the costs of content expenditures for books and courses of million also contributed to the higher cost of revenues in gross margin declined from to due to the higher teacher and course material costs 
additionally  lower average retail classroom enrollments per course offering have reduced classroom utilization which resulted in lower profit margins 
ses cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in gross margin increased from to  primarily due to increased volume providing greater margin expansion 
k services cost of revenue decreased by million  or approximately  from million in to million in gross margin increased from to 
this increase in gross margin is attributed to the increased higher margin assessment revenues and decreased lower margin professional development revenues  offset by lower intervention revenues  which are at a higher gross margin 
in addition the revenues deferred from to as a result of the delay in obtaining a contract signature resulted in a favorable gross margin adjustment in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in included in the selling general and 
table of contents administrative expenses are temporary duplicative costs resulting from moving the financial staff and duplicative hosting costs as we transitioned to a new facility  and increased professional service fees 
test preparation services expenses decreased by  from million in to million in salaries and related costs increased by approximately  as a result of the timing of the hiring of new employees  pay increases and bonus and commissions 
marketing and advertising costs increased million in compared to as a result of higher media spend and increased direct mail campaigns 
offsetting these increases was lower bad debt expense  professional fees and corporate allocations related to technology charges 
ses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is attributable to a increase in revenue 
the greatest increases in costs were incurred in the sales and marketing area to obtain new students and in the salaries and wages to support the new students and expansion into new markets in florida 
k services expenses decreased by million  or  from million in to million in salaries and related costs decreased by million as a result of staff reductions offset by higher corporate allocations for technology related costs for the roll out of the new assessment platform 
corporate expenses increased million or  from million in to million in the company s restructuring costs are included in the corporate operating expense as well as the costs to restate the december  financial statements and higher technology relocation costs 
the restructuring costs of million were primarily severance and benefit costs for finance staff and management changes 
in  the company will incur an additional restructuring charge of million related to exit cost of one of our new york city offices in accordance with sfas no 
impairment of investments in and the company recorded impairment charges for its investment in oasis children s services of million and  respectively 
additionally  the company incurred an impairment charge in of  related to the capitalized software costs for the homeroom platform which was replaced by the assessment center platform 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  or  from  in to  in as a result of the termination of our credit facility and subsequent payoff of the outstanding balance as well as interest income on the net proceeds from the sale of series c preferred stock in july other income expense during  other expense consisted primarily of a million charge for fair value of the embedded derivative and warrant related to the series b preferred stock retired in july income taxes during we continued to record a valuation allowance against the increase in our deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liabilities that are scheduled to reverse in the foreseeable future 
when we achieve profitability  any tax provision recorded as a result of using net operating losses or deductible temporary differences will be offset by a reversal of the tax valuation allowance previously recorded  which reversal would be for the same amount as the provision 
the temporary difference related to amortization of goodwill taken for tax purposes cannot be expected to reverse in the foreseeable future as such a provision of  and  was recorded in and respectively 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december  total revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services revenue decreased by million  or  from million in to million in retail course revenue decreased by million  driven by lower sat course revenue  primarily due to a very significant increase in revenues driven by the new sat introduced at that time  and decreased higher education technology services by million offset by increased tutoring revenue by million and increased institutional sales by million 
ses revenue was million in this increase is the result of increased activity in the new york and chicago markets 
k services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to approximately million in intervention revenue increased by million resulting from new customer contracts  as well as price increases for our sidestreets products 
professional development revenue increased by million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in assessment services revenue of million primarily due to fewer test administrations earlier in the year and the deferral of assessment revenues from the fourth quarter of into as a result of delaying the revenue recognition for a large contract for testing due to the inability to obtain final customer signatures before year end 
cost of revenue for the year ended december   total cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is due to an increase in site rent of  because more classes were held  a  increase in tutoring pay to support higher levels of revenue and as a result of a salary increase 
gross margin declined from to 
additionally  as a result of lower average retail classroom enrollments there was reduced classroom utilization which results in lower profit margins ses cost of revenue was million in gross margins in were 
costs increased due to entry in new york and chicago markets 
k services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in gross margin decreased to in from in this drop in gross margins is attributed to four factors 
first  the higher margin assessment revenues decreased compared to the levels 
second  while intervention revenues increased  the margins on sidestreets revenues were lower than the intervention materials sold in third  we experienced higher customer support costs for many new customer contracts delivered in as we continue to work out the logistics of content development  q a  printing and delivery for multiple customers 
lastly  our content amortization costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the large investment in developing the sidestreets materials during selling  general administrative expenses for the year ending december  operating costs increased million or  from million in to million in test preparation services expenses increased by  from million in to million in 
table of contents ses expenses increased by million or  from  in to million in the greatest increases in costs were incurred in the sales and marketing area to obtain new students and in salaries and wages to support students in new york and chicago 
k services expenses increased by  or  from million in to million in sales commissions increased by approximately million  offset by decreased professional fees and facility costs 
corporate expenses decreased by million  or  from million in to million in professional service fees decreased by  due to lower sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
salaries and related expense decreased by million  due primarily to the benefits of the restructuring program 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  due primarily to the installation of an enterprise resource management system 
impairment of investment our results included an impairment of  related to our investment in oasis 
interest expense interest expense increased to  in from  in due to incremental borrowing under our credit facility 
other income expense during  other expense of  includes the premium paid to fletcher international  ltd 
of approximately  related to the redemption of  shares of our series b preferred stock 
this was partially offset by the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and warrant related to the series b preferred stock 
during  the company had other income of approximately million comprised of million in ses territory rights sales to franchisees and million related to the change in value of the embedded derivatives and warrant 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and collections from customers 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents including  of restricted cash compared to million including  of restricted cash at december  the million increase in cash from the december  balance is primarily attributed to approximately million net cash provided from the issuance of series c preferred stock 
as part of this issuance the company terminated the fletcher agreement pertaining to our series b preferred stock  and all related rights see note 
the company also paid down the million of debt outstanding and terminated our existing credit facility 
additional sources of cash included funds from the sale of the higher education technology services business in february  which resulted in net proceeds of million including a  earnout 
uses of cash included million used in operating activities  million used primarily for the purchase of furniture  fixtures  equipment and software development   related to capital lease payments and  in dividends paid on the series b preferred stock 
our test preparation services division has historically generated  and continues to generate  the largest portion of our cash flow from its retail classroom and tutoring courses 
these customers usually pay us in advance or contemporaneously with the services we provide  thereby supporting our short term liquidity needs increasingly  however  across all of our divisions  we are generating a greater percentage of our cash from contracts with institutions such as schools and school districts and post secondary institutions  all of which pay 
table of contents us in arrears 
typical payment performance for these institutional customers  once invoiced  ranges from to days 
additionally  the long contract approval cycles and or delays in purchase order generation with some of our contracts with large institutions or school districts can contribute to the level of variability in the timing of our cash receipts 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is our net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during  cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was million  compared to cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of  in during the company used approximately million of cash to fund severance and related restructuring costs 
during  investing activities from continuing operations used million of cash as compared to million used during in addition to purchases of fixtures  equipment and software development  the company spent million acquiring existing franchises in financing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of transactions related to our debt and equity structure 
during  financing activities from continuing operations provided million of cash as compared to approximately million in during  net proceeds of million from the july issuance of the series c preferred stock was the primary source of cash 
the net proceeds from the series c preferred stock were used in part to repay the million revolving credit facility and million was used to terminate the series b preferred stock 
during  we borrowed million under a new credit facility 
of this amount  million was used to redeem  shares of series b preferred stock 
the remaining amount borrowed under the credit facility was used for working capital purposes 
in addition  there were financing expenditures of approximately million and million for years ended and  respectively  principally related to capital lease payments  repayment of notes payable and dividends paid on our series b preferred stock 
our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  the timing and extent of technology development expenditures  new business bookings  the timing and collection of receivables and continuing initiatives designed to improve operating cash flow 
we believe that our current cash balances  and anticipated operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements for the next months 
however  in the event of unanticipated cash needs  we may need to secure additional capital within this timeframe 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding  long term office and classroom leases  obligations under promissory notes entered into in connection with acquisitions  employment agreements and several capital leases of computer equipment 
as of december   we operated from leased premises in arizona  california  colorado  florida  georgia  illinois  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  missouri  new jersey  new york  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  tennessee  texas  virginia  washington  washington dc  puerto rico and canada

the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this standard permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective beginning in our fiscal year and are currently not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 to establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures on fair value measurements

are effective beginning in our fiscal year and are currently not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income taxes and prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions 
the first step is recognition based on a determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
the cumulative effect  if any  of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the company s policy is to charge any interest and penalties associated with past due income tax assessments to interest expense in the statement of operations 
the company does not have any significant uncertain contingent tax liabilities at december  or and as a result  the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions and  in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the statute of limitations for adjustments to the company s historic tax obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction

critical accounting policies the estimates  methods and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make subjective and difficult judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts goodwill impairment expense  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating margins when we record the impairment of assets or accelerate their depreciation  valuation of embedded derivatives and warrant which impacts gain or loss on derivative instruments  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  revenue recognition requirements  which impacts how and when we recognize revenue from our goods and services and the estimates we use to record stock based compensation expense 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we review our aged receivables monthly 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for uncollectible accounts if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill and territorial marketing rights 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
no impairment was indicated in  and our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 

table of contents long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
income taxes 
in determining income taxes for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  primarily relating to our net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in varying amounts between and realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the united states prior to expiration of these loss carryforwards 
as of december   we recorded a valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset because of our loss in and the emphasis placed on cumulative losses under generally accepted accounting principles represented sufficient evidence under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes for us to determine that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance 
if  in the future  an appropriate level and consistency of profitability is attained  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for a description of a restatement to our and prior financial statements resulting from the correction of our accounting for deferred income taxes 
revenue recognition 
in general our revenue recognition policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective  with the possible exception being the recognition of revenue for separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue for each product or service by each of the segments 
revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
restructuring 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  our facilities related expenses and liabilities under all of our restructuring plans included estimates of the remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we no longer occupy 
we review our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis until the outcome is finalized and make whatever modifications we believe necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
it is possible that such estimates could change in the future resulting in additional adjustments  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 

table of contents stock based compensation 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement r  applying the modified prospective method 
prior to the adoption of statement r  the company applied the provisions of the accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its stock based awards and accordingly  recognized no compensation cost for its stock options 
under the modified prospective method  statement r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of december  that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  includes the expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement  and the expense for all share based payments granted during the twelve months ended december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
prior period results have not been restated 
stock based compensation was million and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
of the million of stock compensation recorded in  million was recorded as a restructuring charge  million was recorded as bonus expense in lieu of cash and million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
the company used the black sholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during the years ended december   and are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because option pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions  those ranges are disclosed 
these assumptions are based on various factors  including  expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of the company s stock price 
the risk free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant 
the company uses the historical volatility of the company s stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
we typically generate the largest portion of our test preparation revenue in the third quarter 
however  as ses revenues increase  we expect to recognize these revenues primarily in the first and fourth quarters 
our k services division experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenue  with the first and fourth quarters corresponding to the school year expected to have the highest revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk revenue from our international operations and royalty payments from our international franchisees constitute an insignificant percentage of our revenue 
accordingly  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal
