item a 
risk factors the company s business  operating results  financial condition  liquidity  and cash flow may be impacted by numerous factors  including but not limited to those discussed below 
these items may cause the company s results to vary materially from recent results 
interest rate risk the company s earnings  financial condition and liquidity are susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates 
net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings  is the largest component of the company s total revenues 
the level of net interest income is dependent upon the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of nonperforming assets  and the level and trend of interest rates 
changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of prepayments on the company s loans and payments on mortgage backed securities  resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage backed security being prepaid 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including inflation  economic growth  employment levels  monetary policy and international markets 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the company s earnings  financial condition  and liquidity 
the company manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the potential effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income for future periods 
each quarter the company s asset liability management committee reviews the simulation results to determine whether the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within board approved levels 
the committee also discusses strategies to manage this exposure and incorporates these strategies into the investment and funding decisions of the company 
in addition  the company has focused on expanding its fee based business as a percentage of revenues to help mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
for additional information about how the company manages its interest rate risk  refer to part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 
credit risk the company s business of originating and underwriting loans involves credit risk  which is the risk of loss of principal or interest because borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements 
the company has adopted comprehensive credit policies  underwriting standards and loan review procedures and maintains a reserve for loan lease losses to mitigate credit losses 
the company continually monitors asset quality and reviews the adequacy of its allowance for loan and lease losses on a regular basis to ensure that the allowance is adequate to cover the estimated loss exposure in its portfolio 
management believes that it has established policies and procedures that are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss 
nonetheless  these policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
see part ii  item  loans and leases and the allowance for loan and lease losses of this report for further discussion of the lending portfolio and the allowance for loan lease losses 
government laws and regulations the company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations  supervision  and legislation that affect how it conducts its business 
the majority of these laws and regulations are for the protection of consumers  depositors and the deposit insurance funds 
any changes to state and federal banking laws and regulations may negatively impact the company s ability to expand services and to increase shareholder value 
there can also be significant cost related to compliance with various laws and regulations 
the company has established an extensive internal control structure to ensure compliance with governing laws and regulations  including those related to financial reporting 
refer to supervision and regulation for additional information on laws and regulations 
the federal reserve s monetary policies also affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
these policies  which include open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits  can have a major effect upon the source and cost of funds and the rates of return earned on loans and investments 
the company is subject to state and federal tax laws and regulations 
changes to these regulations could impact future tax expense and the value of deferred tax assets 
each of the company s banking subsidiaries is a majority owner in a real estate investment trust reit 
changes to the laws governing the taxation of reits could likely result in additional income tax expense 
competition competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the company s market areas 
in one or more aspects of its business  the company s subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  internet based financial services companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking companies  and other financial intermediaries 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the company does not currently provide 
in addition  many of the company s non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and federally insured banks 
the company focuses on providing unparalleled customer service  which includes offering a strong suite of products and services 
economic conditions general economic conditions have an impact on the banking and financial services industry 
the company s operating results depend on providing products and services to customers in our local market areas 
unemployment rates  real estate values  demographic changes  property tax rates  and local and state governments have an impact on local and regional economic conditions 
an increase in unemployment  a decrease in real estate values  an increase in property tax rates  or a decrease in population could weaken the local economies in which the company operates 
weak economic conditions could lead to credit quality concerns related to repayment ability and collateral protection 
the company operates in three primary market areas which mitigates the impact on local economic conditions and has focused on providing a full suite of products to increase its fee based business as a percentage of total revenues 
operational risk the company is subject to certain operational risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
the company depends upon data processing  software  communication  and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet 
despite instituted safeguards  the company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures 
if information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur  information may be lost or misappropriated  services and operations may be interrupted and the company could be exposed to claims from customers 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintains insurance coverage for exposures that are insurable 
the company regularly tests internal controls to ensure that they are appropriate and functioning as designed 
technological development and changes the financial services industry is subject to rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving the company s ability to serve customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiencies and helps to maintain or reduce expenses 
the company s ability to keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial industry and to introduce new products and services based on this new technology will be important to the company s continued success 
integration of acquisitions the company periodically reviews potential acquisition opportunities involving other financial institutions and financial services companies 
the company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar  present long term growth opportunities  have experienced management  and have the potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services 
risks associated with acquisitions include potential exposure to asset quality issues of the acquired entity  the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired entity  potential disruption to the business of the acquired entity  potential diversion of management time and attention from other matters and impairment of relationships with  and the possible loss of  key employees and customers of the acquired entity 
failure to realize expected revenue increases  cost savings  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation

item legal proceedings in october  visa usa visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its initial public offering ipo expected to occur in as part of that reorganization  tompkins and other member banks of visa received shares of common stock of visa  inc those banks are also obligated under various agreements with visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation covered litigation 
tompkins is not a named defendant in any of the covered litigation 
although visa is expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its ipo in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the covered litigation  recent guidance from the securities and exchange commission sec indicates that visa member banks should record a liability for the fair value of the contingent obligation to visa 
the estimation of the company s proportionate share of any potential losses related to the covered litigation is extremely difficult and involves a great deal of judgment 
nevertheless  in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a pre tax charge of   after tax effect related to the covered litigation 
in accordance with gaap and consistent with the sec guidance  the company did not recognize any value for its common stock ownership interest in visa  inc while the company expects that our proportional share of the proceeds of visa s ipo in will exceed the amount of the company s charge  there can be no assurance that the restructuring and initial public offering of visa  inc will be successful and that the shares of visa  inc allocated to the company will have sufficient value to cover the company s obligations under the indemnification agreement 
the company is involved in legal proceedings in the normal course of business  none of which are expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company

unless the context otherwise requires  the term company refers to tompkins financial corporation and its subsidiaries 
headquartered in ithaca  new york  tompkins is registered as a financial holding company with the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of  as amended 
tompkins was organized in under the laws of the state of new york  as a bank holding company for tompkins trust company  a commercial bank that has operated in ithaca and surrounding communities since forward looking statements the company is making this statement in order to satisfy the safe harbor provision contained in the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this report on form k that are not statements of historical fact may include forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are made based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company and are subject to certain uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and economic environment  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company  that could cause actual results of the company to differ materially from those matters expressed and or implied by forward looking statements 
the following factors are among those that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements changes in general economic  market and regulatory conditions  the development of an interest rate environment that may adversely affect the company s interest rate spread  other income or cash flow anticipated from the company s operations  investment and or lending activities  changes in laws and regulations affecting banks  bank holding companies and or financial holding companies  technological developments and changes  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  governmental and public policy changes  including environmental regulation  protection and validity of intellectual property rights  reliance on large customers  and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support the company s future businesses 
in addition  such forward looking statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general economic and political conditions  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and other factors 
critical accounting policies in the course of normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
some of these policies are more critical than others 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan lease losses allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates can have on the company s results of operations 
the company has developed a methodology to measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio to assure that an adequate allowance is maintained 
the company s methodology is based upon guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues and includes an estimate of exposure for the following specifically reviewed and graded loans  historical loss experience by product type  past due and nonperforming loans  and other internal and external factors such as local and regional economic conditions  growth trends  and credit policy and underwriting standards 
the methodology includes a review of loans considered impaired in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as well as other commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that are evaluated using an internal rating system 
an estimated exposure amount is assigned to these internally reviewed credits based upon a review of the borrower s financial condition  payment history  collateral adequacy  and business conditions 
for commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans not specifically reviewed  and for more homogenous loan portfolios such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  estimated exposure amounts are assigned based upon historical loss experience as well as past due status 
lastly  additional reserves are maintained based upon management s judgment and assessment of other quantitative and qualitative factors such as regional and local economic conditions and portfolio growth trends 
since the methodology is based upon historical experience  market trends  and management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in the local area  changes in interest rates  concentration of risk  and declines in local property values 
while management considers the allowance to be adequate as of december   under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the company would need to increase the allowance 
another critical accounting policy is the policy for pensions and other post retirement benefits 
the calculation of the expenses and liabilities related to pensions and post retirement benefits requires estimates and assumptions of key factors including  but not limited to  discount rate  return on plan assets  future salary increases  employment levels  employee retention  and life expectancies of plan participants 
the company uses an actuarial firm in making these estimates and assumptions 
changes in these assumptions due to market conditions  governing laws and regulations  or company specific circumstances may result in material changes to the company s pension and other post retirement expenses and liabilities 
all accounting policies are important and the reader of the financial statements should review these policies  described in note summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k  to gain a better understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported

roe was in  compared to in  while roa was in  compared to in the decrease in roa and roe in reflects the decrease in net income coupled with growth in average assets and average shareholders equity 
roa and roe for tompkins continue to compare favorably to peer ratios for bank holding companies with assets between billion and billion  widely available from the federal reserve board 
total revenues  consisting of net interest income and noninterest income  were million in  up million or over the growth rate over the prior year was tempered by the fact that included million in nonrecurring revenue  including million from the sale of the credit card portfolio and  of life insurance proceeds

the taxable equivalent net interest margin for of is down from the for the interest rate environment has been challenging over the past few years  as the flat or inverted yield curve has resulted in narrowing spreads between loan and securities yields and the various funding sources used to support these activities

management believes that the company s community banking strategy provides value to small business customers  while commercial lending products are typically attractive to the company from a yield and interest rate risk perspective 
the combined legal lending limits of the company s three subsidiary banks has allowed the company to attract larger lending relationships

the allowance for loan and lease losses management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses allowance on a regular basis 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance to be a critical accounting policy  given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that assumptions could have on the company s results of operations 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance and related provision include management s approach to granting new credit  the ongoing monitoring of existing credits by the internal and external loan review functions  the growth and composition of the loan and lease portfolio  comments received during the course of independent examinations  current local economic conditions  past due and nonperforming loan statistics  the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  the estimated values of collateral  and a historical review of loan and lease loss experience 
the company has developed a methodology to measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio to assure that an adequate allowance is maintained 
the company s methodology is based upon guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues and includes an estimate of exposure for the following specifically reviewed and graded loans  historical loss experience by product type  past due and nonperforming loans  and other internal and external factors such as local and regional economic conditions  growth trends  and credit policy and underwriting standards 
the methodology includes a review of loans considered impaired in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as well as other commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that are evaluated using an internal rating system 
an estimated exposure amount is assigned to these internally reviewed credits based upon a review of the borrower s financial condition  payment history  collateral adequacy  and business conditions 
for commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans not specifically reviewed  and for homogenous loan portfolios such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  estimated exposure amounts are assigned based upon historical loss experience  past due status  and management s judgment of the effects of recent and forecasted economic conditions on portfolio performance 
lastly  additional amounts are maintained based upon management s judgment and assessment of other quantitative and qualitative factors such as regional and local economic conditions  concentrations of credit  industry concerns  adverse market changes in estimated or appraised collateral value  and portfolio growth trends 
since the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends as well as management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in the local area  concentration of risk  changes in interest rates  and declines in local property values 
while management s evaluation of the allowance as of december   considers the allowance to be adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the company would need to increase the allowance 
the allocation of the company s allowance as of december   and each of the previous four years is illustrated in table allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses  below 
table allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses december dollar amounts in thousands total loans outstanding at end of year    allocation of the allowance by loan type commercial    real estate    consumer and all other    unallocated total    allocation of the allowance as a percentage of total allowance commercial real estate consumer and all other unallocated total loan and lease types as a percentage of total loans and leases commercial real estate consumer and all other total management is committed to early recognition of loan problems and to maintaining an adequate allowance 
the above allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may occur  nor is it an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
the increase in the allowance between year end and year end reflects higher allocations due to growth in the loan portfolio and additional allocations based upon historical loss experience 
the increase in the allowance allocated to real estate loans in over was a result of the growth in the portfolio as well as the overall weakening conditions in the real estate market 
the level of future charge offs are dependent upon a variety of factors such as national and local economic conditions  trends in various industries  underwriting characteristics  and conditions unique to each borrower 
given uncertainties surrounding these factors  it is difficult to estimate future losses 
the principal balances of nonperforming loans and leases  including impaired loans and leases  as of december  are detailed in the table below

the difference between the interest income that would have been recorded if nonaccrual loans and leases had been paid in accordance with their original terms and the interest income recorded for the years ended december   and was not material

potential problem loans and leases are loans and leases that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubt as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in such loans and leases becoming nonperforming at sometime in the future 
management considers loans and leases classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest  to be potential problem loans and leases 
the company  through its internal loan review function identified commercial relationships totaling million at december   and commercial relationships totaling million at december   which it classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest 
these loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors  including payment history  the value of collateral supporting the credits  and personal or government guarantees 
these factors  when considered in the aggregate  give management reason to believe that the current risk exposure on these loans does not warrant accounting for these loans as nonperforming 
however  these loans do exhibit certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming 
accordingly  management s attention is focused on these credits  which are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
the decrease in the dollar amount of commercial relationships classified as substandard and still accruing between december  and december  was mainly due to three commercial relationships totaling million that were classified as substandard and accruing at december   and substandard and nonaccruing at december  deposits and other liabilities total deposits of billion at december   were up less than over year end  however  the composition of the deposit base changed between year end and year end in  market rates and deposit rates were trending up which led to growth in more rate sensitive deposit categories  such as time deposits of  or more 
in  rates stabilized in the first half of the year  and decreased over the second half as the federal reserve cut short term interest rates 
this contributed to a decrease in time deposits of  or more and an increase in core deposits  defined as total deposits less time deposits of  or more  brokered deposits and municipal money market deposits 
core deposits grew by million or to billion at year end from billion at year end the growth in core deposits since december   was mainly in money market and savings balances and noninterest bearing balances  which are up and  respectively  from december  core deposits represented of total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  the growth in core deposits was partially offset by a decrease in time deposits of  and more  which were down by million or between year end and year end the decrease was mainly in municipal time deposits

the company uses both retail and wholesale repurchase agreements 
retail repurchase agreements are arrangements with local customers of the company  in which the company agrees to sell securities to the customer with an agreement to repurchase those securities at a specified later date 
retail repurchase agreements totaled million at december   and million at december  management generally views local repurchase agreements as an alternative to large time deposits 
the company s wholesale repurchase agreements are primarily with the federal home loan bank fhlb and amounted to million at december   and million at december  included in the million of wholesale repurchase agreements at year end  are million of repurchase agreements with the fhlb where the company has elected to adopt the fair value option under sfas the fair value of these borrowings decreased  over the months ended december  refer to note securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further details on the company s repurchase agreements

other borrowings also include a treasury tax and loan note account with the federal reserve bank of new york totaling  at december  and december  at december  and  tompkins insurance had borrowings of  and  respectively  from unrelated financial institutions 
liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of adequate funding sources to satisfy the demand for credit  deposit withdrawals  operating expenses  and business investment opportunities 
the company s large  stable core deposit base and strong capital position are the foundation for the company s liquidity position 
the company uses a variety of resources to meet its liquidity needs  which include deposits  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from lending and investing activities  repurchase agreements  and borrowings 
the company may also use borrowings as part of a growth strategy 
asset and liability positions are monitored primarily through the asset liability management committee of the company s subsidiary banks 
this committee reviews periodic reports on the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions 
comparisons with industry and peer groups are also monitored 
the company s strong reputation in the communities it serves  along with its strong financial condition  provide access to numerous sources of liquidity as described below 
management believes these diverse liquidity sources provide sufficient means to meet all demands on the company s liquidity that are reasonably likely to occur 
core deposits are a primary low cost funding source obtained primarily through the company s branch network 
core deposits totaled billion at year end  up million or from year end  with the increase mainly in money market and savings deposits and noninterest bearing deposits 
core deposits represented of total deposits and of total liabilities at december   compared to of total deposits and of total liabilities at december  the addition of three new banking offices in contributed to the growth in core deposits in over in addition to core deposits  the company uses non core funding sources to support asset growth 
these non core funding sources include time deposits of  or more  brokered time deposits  municipal money market accounts  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and term advances from the fhlb 
rates and terms are the primary determinants of the mix of these funding sources 
non core funding sources increased by million from million at year end to million at year end as a percentage of total liabilities  non core funding sources increased from at year end to at year end the increase in the dollar volume of non core funding was concentrated in overnight and term advances from the fhlb  which were up million and million  respectively 
time deposits of  or more were down million or from year end to year end non core funding sources may require securities to be pledged against the underlying liability 
securities carried at million and million at december  and  respectively  were either pledged or sold under agreements to repurchase 
pledged securities represented of total securities at december   compared to of total securities at december  cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   down from million at december  short term investments  consisting of securities due in one year or less  increased from million at december   to million on december  the company also has million of securities designated as trading securities 
cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios provides a significant source of liquidity 
these assets may have stated maturities in excess of one year  but have monthly principal reductions 
total mortgage backed securities  at fair value  were million at december  compared with million at december  outstanding principle balances of residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  and leases totaled approximately million at december  as compared to million at december  aggregate amortization from monthly payments on these assets provides significant additional cash flow to the company 
liquidity is enhanced by ready access to national and regional wholesale funding sources including federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  brokered certificates of deposit  and fhlb advances 
through its subsidiary banks  the company has borrowing relationships with the fhlb and correspondent banks  which provide secured and unsecured borrowing capacity 
at december   the unused borrowing capacity on established lines with the fhlb was million 
as members of the fhlb  the company s subsidiary banks can use certain unencumbered mortgage related assets to secure additional borrowings from the fhlb 
at december   total unencumbered residential mortgage loans of the company were million 
additional assets may also qualify as collateral for fhlb advances upon approval of the fhlb 
the company has not identified any trends or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity in the near term

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk interest rate risk is the primary market risk category associated with the company s operations 
interest rate risk refers to the volatility of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
the company manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the potential effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income for future periods 
each quarter the company s asset liability management committee reviews the simulation results to determine whether the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within board approved levels 
the committee also discusses strategies to manage this exposure and incorporates these strategies into the investment and funding decisions of the company 
the company does not currently use derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  to manage its interest rate risk exposure  but may consider such instruments in the future 
the company s board of directors has set a policy that interest rate risk exposure will remain within a range whereby net interest income will not decline by more than in one year as a result of a basis point parallel change in rates 
based upon the simulation analysis performed as of december   a basis point parallel upward change in interest rates over a one year time frame would result in a one year decline in net interest income from the base case of approximately  while a basis point parallel decline in interest rates over a one year period would result in a one year decline in net interest income from the base case of 
the simulation assumes no balance sheet growth and no management action to address balance sheet mismatches 
the negative exposure in a rising rate environment is mainly driven by the repricing assumptions of the company s core deposit base and the lag in the repricing of the company s adjustable rate assets 
longer term  the impact of a rising rate environment is positive as the asset base continues to reset at higher levels  while the repricing of the rate sensitive liabilities moderates 
the negative exposure in the basis point decline scenario results from the company s assets repricing downward to a greater degree than the rates on the company s interest bearing liabilities  mainly deposits 
rates on savings and money market accounts are at low levels given the historically low interest rate environment experienced in recent years 
in addition  the model assumes that prepayment accelerate in the down interest rate environment resulting in addition pressure on asset yields as proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
in our most recent simulation  the base case scenario  which assumes interest rates remain unchanged from the date of the simulation  showed a relatively flat net interest margin during although the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate movements  actual results may differ from those modeled as the repricing  maturity  and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments may change to a different degree than modeled 
in addition  the model does not reflect actions that management may employ to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
the company s current liquidity profile  capital position  and growth prospects  offer a level of flexibility for management to take actions that could offset some of the negative effects of unfavorable movements in interest rates 
management believes the current exposure to changes in interest rates is not significant in relation to the earnings and capital strength of the company 
in addition to the simulation analysis  management uses an interest rate gap measure 
table interest rate risk analysis below is a condensed static gap report  which illustrates the anticipated repricing intervals of assets and liabilities as of december  the company s one year interest rate gap was a negative  or of total assets at december   compared with a negative  or of total assets at december  a negative gap position exists when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a particular time period 
this analysis suggests that the company s net interest income is more vulnerable to a rising rate environment than it is to sustained low interest rates 
an interest rate gap measure could be significantly affected by external factors such as a rise or decline in interest rates  loan or securities prepayments  and deposit withdrawals
