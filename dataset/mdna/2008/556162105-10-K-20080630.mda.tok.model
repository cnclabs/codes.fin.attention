item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set out in part i general information  item a risk factors elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our business we are a leading provider of video game accessories  pc game accessories  pc input devices  multimedia audio products  chess and intelligent games and software primarily marketed under the mad catz  gameshark  joytech and saitek brands 
we also produce for selected customers a limited range of products which are marketed on a private label basis 
we design  manufacture primarily through third parties in asia  market and distribute accessories for all major video game platforms  the pc and  to a lesser extent the ipod and other audio devices 
our products include control pads  steering wheels  joysticks  memory cards  video cables  light guns  dance pads  microphones  car adapters  carry cases  mice  keyboards and headsets 
we also market video game enhancement software and publish video games 
in september  we acquired certain assets of joytech from take two interactive software  inc nasdaq ttwo for approximately million 
the assets acquired included inventories  property and equipment and intangible assets such as trademarks  customer relationships and product lines 
in november  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of a private holding company that owns saitek  a leading provider of pc game accessories  pc input devices  multimedia audio products and chess and intelligent games for approximately million  including transaction costs and restructuring accruals totaling million 
we acquired all of saitek s net tangible and intangible assets  including trademarks  tradenames  customer relationships and product lines 

table of contents seasonality and fluctuation of sales we generate a substantial percentage of our net sales in the last three months of every calendar year  our fiscal third quarter 
our quarterly results of operations can be expected to fluctuate significantly in the future  as a result of many factors  including seasonal influences on our sales  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the introduction of new video game platforms  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  and timing of introductions of new products 
see further discussion and sales by quarter under net sales below 
continuing transition to current generation consoles our industry is cyclical and we believe it is still transitioning to the current generation of game consoles  which began with the release of microsoft s xbox in november and continued with the north american releases of sony s playstation and nintendo s wii at the end of in fiscal  we expanded our range of accessories compatible with the xbox  playstation and wii video game consoles as well as continued to provide accessories to the significant installed base of current consoles in the marketplace 
to date  our ability to release certain products on the new video game consoles has been restricted by technological requirements 
foreign currency approximately of our annual sales are transacted outside the united states 
the majority of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
to date we have not hedged against foreign currency exposure and we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us in the future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue when each of the following have occurred there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  the products are delivered  which generally occurs when the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable 
our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net and day terms 
revenues from sales to authorized resellers are subject to terms allowing price protection  certain rights of return and allowances for volume rebates and cooperative advertising 
allowances for price protection are recorded when the price protection program is offered 
allowances for estimated future returns and cooperative advertising are provided for upon recognition of revenue 
such amounts are estimated and periodically adjusted based on historical and anticipated rates of returns  inventory levels and other factors and are recorded as either operating 
table of contents expenses or a reduction of sales in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
customer marketing programs we record allowances for customer marketing programs  including certain rights of return  price protection  and cooperative advertising 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue or as an operating expense in the period we sell the product or commit to the program 
significant management judgments and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
we grant limited rights of return for certain products 
estimates of expected future product returns are based on analyses of historical returns and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
consistent with industry standards and practices  on a product by product basis by customer  we allow price protection credits to be issued to retailers in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the price of a product as a result of reduction in competitive prices and issue credits to our customers to protect the customers from lower profit margins on their then current inventory of the product 
the decision to effect price reductions is influenced by retailer inventory levels  product lifecycle stage  market acceptance  competitive environment and new product introductions 
credits are issued based upon the number of units that customers have on hand at the date of the price reduction 
upon approval of a price protection program  reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established 
reserves are estimated based on analyses of qualified inventories on hand with retailers and distributors 
we enter into cooperative advertising arrangements with many of our customers allowing customers to receive a credit for various advertising programs 
the amounts of the credits are based on specific dollar value programs or a percentage of sales  depending on the terms of the program negotiated with the individual customer 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these advertising programs are recorded based on the specific negotiations with individual customers in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of these cooperative advertising program accruals 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take action to increase customer programs and incentive offerings that could result in incremental reductions to revenue or increased operating expenses at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products in the united states and internationally primarily through retailers 
we generally do not require any collateral from our customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and by purchasing credit insurance on certain european accounts receivable balances 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable  and we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which we believe is adequate 
the allowance is based on management s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as historical experience with bad debts  receivables aging and current economic trends 
our customer base is highly concentrated and a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition  or a decline in the general economic conditions could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
as of march   one customer represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivables as of march  if any of these customer s receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 

table of contents inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
if the estimated market value is determined to be less than the recorded cost of the inventory  a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item 
determination of the market value may be complex  and therefore  requires management to make assumptions and to apply a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  inventory quantities on hand in our facilities and customer inventories  unfilled customer order quantities  forecasted consumer demand  current retail prices  competitive pricing  seasonality factors  consumer trends and performance of similar products or accessories 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded reserves 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology or assumptions used to establish our inventory reserves as reported during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a significant change in the future methodology or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves 
however  if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate  or changes in consumer demand affect specific products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional increases in our inventory reserves that could be material 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment review at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment are present 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we performed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal years  and and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its net book value 
therefore  step two was not required 
share based payments effective april   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which established accounting for share based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the expected life of the options is based on a number of factors  including historical exercise experience  the vesting term of the award  the expected volatility of our stock and an employee s average length of service 
the expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility using daily pricing of our stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined on a constant us treasury security rate with a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the stock options 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we reduce the calculated black scholes value by applying a forfeiture rate  based upon historical pre vesting option cancellations 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed at each balance sheet date and may change based on new facts and circumstances 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales from a geographical perspective  our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and were as follows in thousands year ended year ended march  march  net sales of total net sales of total change change united states europe canada other countries consolidated net sales net sales in fiscal decreased from fiscal net sales in the united states decreased million over the prior year primarily due to our continuing efforts to reduce sales of low margin and unprofitable products and declines in sales of accessories relating to the prior generation video game console platforms 
the sales decline was partially offset by increased sales of accessories relating to current generation video game console platforms 
due to the cyclical nature of the gaming console industry we believe that the sales of current generation accessories will continue to increase compared to the prior generation products as current generation consoles reach full adoption and more demand is driven by the release of current generation games 
we do not currently have a license to manufacture wireless control pads for the xbox or controllers for nintendo s wii  to date the leading console gaming platforms 
as a result  sales of control pads decreased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
in the united states sales of products for the playstation and xbox declined  partially offset by an increase in sales of products for the xbox  playstation and the wii 
the decline in consolidated net sales was also partially offset by a increase in sales due to the saitek acquisition 
net sales in europe increased million primarily due to the acquisition of saitek  which accounted for of the increase 
sales also increased due to the continued expansion of market penetration by the mad catz and joytech product lines 
net sales in canada declined by million primarily due to a decline in core product sales primarily non licensed control pads to existing customers  as well as the company s elimination of low margin and unprofitable product placements 
net sales to other countries increased by million  primarily due to the acquisition of saitek which accounted for of the increase offset by a decrease of attributable to mci

gross profit gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of product costs  cost of licenses and royalties  cost of freight in and freight out and distribution center costs  including depreciation and other overhead costs 

table of contents the following table presents net sales  cost of sales and gross profit for fiscal years ended march  and in thousands year ended march  of of amount net sales amount net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit gross profit in fiscal increased from fiscal  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was largely due to a reduction in sales of low margin and unprofitable products and an increase in sales of higher margin products  which increased margins by approximately percentage points 
a reduction in royalty and license expenses increased profit margin by approximately percentage point 
a reduction in freight expense due to a higher mix of direct imports to customers and renegotiated shipping rates increased profit margin by approximately percentage point 
these increases in profit margin were partially offset by a reduction in cost credits received due to a decrease in goods returned to vendors in fiscal  which decreased profit margin by approximately percentage points 
the increases were further reduced by a rise in distribution handling cost in europe causing a percentage point decrease in profit margin and an increase of obsolete and scrap inventory expense decreased profit margin by half of a percentage point 
there was an increase in the gross profit margin of approximately percentage point due to the saitek acquisition  as saitek s products historically have generated a higher gross profit margin than mad catz 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal years ended march  and were as follows in thousands march  of march  of net sales net sales change change sales and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles total operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll  commissions  participation at trade shows and travel costs for our worldwide sales and marketing staff  advertising and costs of operating our gameshark 
com website 
the increase in sales and marketing expense of is mainly due to the saitek acquisition 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales is due to an increase in the fixed portion of these expenses in a period in which sales declined on a year over year basis 
excluding the impact of the saitek acquisition  sales and marketing expenses declined  largely due to decreased cooperative advertising expenses which are based on sales volume  partially offset by higher salary expenses relating to an increase in the mad catz european sales force and the hiring of a new director of marketing in the united states 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits for our executive and administrative personnel  facilities costs and professional services  such as legal and accounting 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of is primarily due to the saitek acquisition  which accounted for of the increase 
also contributing to the increase were higher accruals pursuant to the executive and non executive incentive compensation plans adopted by the board of directors  higher consulting fees due to our first year of management testing in compliance with sarbanes oxley and higher professional fees related to our post acquisition integration of the saitek acquisition 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in general and administrative expenses due to lower legal expenses resulting from less litigation activity during fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs of developing and enhancing new and existing products in addition to the costs of developing games 
the increase in research and development is primarily a result of the acquisition of saitek  partially offset by decreased software development costs as we had no software game titles in development during fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased due to the acquisitions of joytech and saitek 
interest expense  foreign exchange gain and other income interest expense  foreign exchange gain and other income for fiscal years ended march  and was as follows in thousands march  of march  of net sales net sales change change interest expense foreign exchange gain other income interest expense in fiscal increased from the prior year due to an increase in total debt outstanding attributable to financing the saitek acquisition  partly offset by a decline in the average balance of our line of credit for working capital needs and a decline in the line of credit interest rate during the period 
the increase in foreign exchange gain in fiscal compared to fiscal results primarily from the gain in relative value between the british pound  the functional currency of our mce entity  and the euro  the currency used by a significant number of its customers 
the currency fluctuations against the us dollar during the year also contributed to this gain 
other income primarily consists of advertising income from our gameshark 
com website and royalties paid by an unrelated third party to distribute our products in australia 
the increase in other income is primarily due to increased sales to the unrelated third party distributor 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for fiscal years ended march  and was as follows in thousands march  effective march  effective tax rate tax rate change change the company s effective tax rate is a blended rate for different jurisdictions in which the company operates 
our effective tax rate fluctuates depending on the composition of our taxable income between the various jurisdictions in which we do business  including our canadian subsidiary and specific saitek subsidiaries  for which we provide full valuation allowances against their losses 
the increase in effective tax rate in fiscal versus fiscal is a direct reflection of having a higher mix of business in higher tax rate jurisdictions  as well as an increase in expenses at our canadian holding company  which are not deductible for us financial reporting or tax purposes
