item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to the company s results of operations and financial condition as of  and for each of the three years ended  september this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included herein 
non gaap financial measures no non gaap financial measure should be considered as a substitute for any related financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  the company believes the use of non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information with which to evaluate its financial performance  or assist in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
the company also believes such non gaap financial measures are alternative indicators of performance used by investors  lenders  rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a publishing business or its ability to meet debt service requirements 
operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow  which is defined as operating income before depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and other assets and equity in earnings of associated companies  and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow divided by operating revenue represent non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
the company believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information because of their focus on results from operations before depreciation  amortization  impairment charges and earnings from equity investments 
reconciliations of operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to operating income loss and operating income loss margin  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are included in the table below thousands percent of revenue percent of revenue percent of revenue operating cash flow less depreciation and amortization less impairment of goodwill and other assets  nm  plus equity in earnings of associated companies less reduction in investment in tni  nm operating income loss  nm   adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share  which are defined as income loss available to common stockholders and earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude unusual matters and those of a substantially non recurring nature  are non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below

index to financial statements information by identifying matters that are not indicative of core business operating results or are of a substantially non recurring nature 
reconciliations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings loss per common share to income loss available to common stockholders and earnings loss per common share  respectively  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are set forth below under the caption overall results 
same property comparisons certain information below  as noted  is presented on a same property basis  which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures consummated in the current or prior year 
the company believes such comparisons provide meaningful supplemental information for an understanding of changes in its revenue and operating expenses 
same property comparisons exclude tni and mni 
the company owns of tni and also owns of the capital stock of mni  both of which are reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of the company s accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of its goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets  the company makes a determination of the fair value of its business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the publishing industry 
an impairment charge will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
the required valuation methodology and underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the company analyzes its goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at the end of its fiscal year  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  for a more detailed explanation of the company s intangible assets 
such indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate and operating or cash flow losses related to such assets 
due primarily to the continuing  and increasing difference between its stock price and the per share carrying value of its net assets  the company analyzed the carrying value of its net assets as of march  and again as of september  deterioration in the company s revenue and the overall recessionary operating environment for the company and other publishing companies were also factors in the timing of the analyses 
the company concluded the fair value of its business did not exceed the carrying value of its net assets as of march  and again as of september  
table of contents 
index to financial statements as a result  in the company recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill by  the company also recorded pretax  non cash charges of  and  to reduce the carrying value of nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets  respectively 
 of additional pretax charges were recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the company s investment in tni 
the company also recorded additional  pretax non cash charges of  to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
the company recorded  of income tax benefit related to these charges 
the company reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
the company assesses recovery of these assets by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group with their carrying amount 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
the company also periodically evaluates its determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets 
any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact the cash flows of the company 
however  a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share 
the company tested such assets for impairment  and concluded no adjustments to the useful lives of such assets were required 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans the company evaluates its liability for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon computations made by consulting actuaries  incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors 
if the company used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods 
increases in market interest rates  which may impact plan assumptions  generally result in lower service costs for current employees  higher interest expense and lower liabilities 
actual returns on plan assets that are lower than the plan assumptions will generally result in decreases in a plan s funded status 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
recent changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions can result in significant variability in the company s effective income tax rate 
the company files income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  the company is subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believes its positions taken regarding its filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
however  the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material  either positively or negatively  to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined 
the company does not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to its consolidated financial position or cash flows 
revenue recognition advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related online site 
circulation revenue is recorded as newspapers are distributed over the subscription term 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for publications or advance payments for advertising

index to financial statements uninsured risks the company is self insured for health care  workers compensation and certain long term disability costs of its employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
the company accrues its estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts 
an increasing frequency of large claims or deterioration in overall claim experience could increase the volatility of expenses for such self insured risks 
the company s reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries 
the amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry

the pulitzer notes mature in april the company is actively engaged in discussions with the noteholders  and to the extent their approval may also be required  the lenders  to extend or refinance the pulitzer notes 
the company has also initiated discussions with the lenders related to changes to the credit agreement to maintain sufficient long term liquidity 
however  the timing and ultimate outcome of such discussions cannot be determined at this time due in part  to the abnormal condition of the domestic credit markets and the overall recessionary operating environment in which the company  pulitzer  and other publishing companies are currently operating 
continuing instability or further disruptions of these markets could prohibit or make it more difficult for the company to access new capital  increase the cost of capital or limit its ability to refinance existing indebtedness

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates restricted cash and investments interest rate risk in the company s restricted cash and investments is managed by investing only in short term securities 
only us government and related securities are permitted 
debt the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to libor 
a basis point increase to libor would decrease income from continuing operations before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately  based on  of floating rate debt outstanding at september   after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  and excluding debt subject to interest rate collars described below and debt of mni 
such interest rates may also decrease 
at september   the company has outstanding interest rate swaps in the notional amount of  the interest rate swaps have original terms of three to five years  carry interest rates from to plus the applicable libor margin and effectively fix the company s interest rate on debt in the amount  and for the time periods  of such instruments 
in november  interest rate swaps in the notional amounts of  expired 
in  the company executed interest rate collars in the notional amount of  the collars have a two year term and limit libor to an average floor of and a cap of 
such collars effectively limit the range of the company s exposure to interest rates to libor greater than the floor and less than the cap in either case plus the applicable libor margin for the time period of such instruments 
at september   after consideration of the interest rate swaps described above  approximately of the principal amount of the company s debt is subject to floating interest rates 
the interest rate collars described above limit the company s exposure to interest rates on an additional of the principal amount of its debt 
certain of the company s interest earning assets  including those in employee benefit plans  also function as a natural hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on debt 
commodities certain materials used by the company are exposed to commodity price changes 
the company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
the company is a participant in a buying cooperative with other publishing companies  primarily for acquisition of newsprint 
the company is also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink and energy costs 
between november and december  north american newsprint manufacturers implemented  or attempted to implement  as many as price increases totaling up to per metric ton on standard pound newsprint 
in october  november and december  several suppliers delayed or rescinded several of such price increases 
north american newsprint suppliers took significant steps in to curtail newsprint production capacity in an effort to balance supply capacity with declining demand trends and additional capacity reductions have been announced for curtailment activities include permanent  indefinite  and temporary shutdown of newsprint production facilities 
however  the significant 
table of contents 
index to financial statements decline in north american newsprint demand and consumption appears to be greater than the total newsprint production restraints and may favorably impact pricing trends in in addition  and increases in raw material costs  energy costs and the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  all of which contributed to recent increases in newsprint prices  have recently reverted to significantly lower levels  which may mitigate future increases in newsprint costs  or lead to a decline in such costs 
the final extent of changes in price  if any  is subject to negotiation between such manufacturers and the company 
a per metric ton price increase for pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before income taxes of approximately  based on anticipated consumption in  excluding consumption of mni and tni and the impact of lifo accounting 
such prices may also decrease 
sensitivity to changes in value the company s fixed rate debt consists of the pulitzer notes  which are not traded on an active market and held by a small group of noteholders 
coupled with the volatility of substantially all domestic credit markets that exists in the current recession  the company is unable  as of september   to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of fixed rate debt of the company in one year from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the change in value  if determined  would likely be significant 
changes in the value of interest rate swaps and interest rate collars from movements in interest rates are not determinable  due to the number of variables involved in the pricing of such instruments 
however  increases in interest rates would generally result in increases in the fair value of such instruments
