we have been profitable every full quarter since we opened in december  except for the first quarter of our net interest margin for the last three years has been consistently strong 
this factor  coupled with gain on sale of loans and servicing income associated with sba and mortgage loan sales  represents a significant portion of the profit dynamics of our company 
we sold million of the guaranteed portion and million of the unguaranteed portion of sba a loans in  which added million and million  respectively  to revenue

due to increasing interest rates  mortgage loan activity slowed considerably in and remained at subdued levels in and in  the housing slowdown continued to decrease mortgage loan activity 
during  sba a guaranteed loan sales for were million  compared to million in  and million in net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our income from operations 
net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the volume of and interest rate earned on interest earning assets and the volume of and interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million in  compared to million in  and million in the growth in net interest income levels have been achieved as a result of strong asset mix  which consists primarily of loans at variable rates  as well as growth of our loan portfolio 
our net interest margin was in  compared to in  and in in the initial cycle of a flat rate environment following a rising rate environment  the net interest margin will slightly compress due to longer term  lower rate time deposits maturing and repricing at a higher rate 
in a flat rate environment followed by a falling rate environment  the net interest margin will compress  mostly in the first six months  due to assets repricing more frequently than deposits 
although the yield on interest earning assets decreased by basis points for  the yield on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points for the same period 
the following is a summation of various yields for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december    and loans produced a yield of in  in  and in the decrease in loan yields has been the result of a decreasing interest rate environment and higher nonaccrual loans 
yield on investments  federal funds sold and us agencies  increased to in  compared to in  and in the increase in investment yields is a result of an increase in average federal funds rate from in to in total interest earning assets yielded in  in  and in cost of interest bearing deposits increased to in  compared to in  and in the increase is a result of the growth in higher rate interest bearing deposits compared to the other interest bearing deposits 
cost of other borrowings  fhlb advances  and junior subordinated debt borrowings  increased to in  compared to in and in contributing to the increase in the cost of borrowings was the slight increase in junior subordinated debt rates 
our goal is to maintain at least of our assets as interest earning assets

provision for loan loss the allowance for loan losses represents our management s best estimate of probable losses in our loan portfolio 
we have a monitoring system to identify impaired and or potential problem loans 
this system assists in the periodic evaluation of impairment and determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses required 
our monitoring system and allowance for loan losses methodology has evolved over a period of years  and loan classifications have been incorporated into the determination of our allowance for loan losses 
our monitoring system and allowance methodology include an assessment of individual classified loans  as well as applying loss factors to all loans not individually classified 
classified loans are reviewed individually to estimate the amount of probable loss that needs to be included in our allowance 
these reviews include analysis of financial information as well as evaluation of collateral securing the credit 
the analysis considers general factors such as changes in lending policies and procedures  economic trends  loan volume trends  changes in lending management and staff  trends in delinquencies  nonaccruals and charge offs  changes in loan review and board oversight  the effects of competition  legal and regulatory requirements  and factors inherent to each loan pool

we had million of nonperforming loans as of december   of which million was guaranteed by the sba  compared to million of nonperforming loans as of december   of which million was guaranteed by the sba  and million of nonperforming loans as of december   of which million was sba guaranteed 
the majority of nonperforming assets are sba loans  which represent million of the net exposure 
the remaining million of conventional non accrual loans consists of five loans 
of the two most significant of these loans  one is a million construction loan for single family residences located in victorville  ca 
ten homes have sold and closed escrow and there are five homes in escrow 
the remaining homes are completed and unsold 
we feel that there is approximately  in loss exposure on the victorville project 
the other is a land development loan for million located in folsom  ca  where we do not anticipate a loss 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  net charge offs were million in  thousand in  and thousand in non interest income non interest income is an important revenue source for us 
non interest income consists of service charges and fees  gain on sale of loans and other assets  and loan servicing  broker and other loan related income 
non interest income was in  compared to million in  and million in the primary contributor to the decrease in non interest income from to was the decrease in the sba servicing income

at december   we were servicing approximately million of the guaranteed portion of a loans previously sold in the secondary market with a weighted average servicing and i o rate of 
the decrease in servicing income has resulted from the declining fair value of the servicing and i o assets to account for an increase in the prepayments experienced in our sba loan portfolio  as well as a decrease in ongoing servicing income resulting from the lower servicing rate 
non interest expense non interest expenses consist of salaries and benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment  processing  office expense and professional costs such as legal and auditing  marketing and regulatory fees 
these expenses are reviewed and controlled to maintain cost effective levels of operation

occupancy expense was million in  compared to million in  and million in furniture and equipment expense was million in  compared to million in  and million in contributing to these increases are the costs related to the opening of the san marcos branch in  the solana beach and ontario branches in  and the carlsbad branch in legal and professional expenses were million in and million in and the increase in legal and professional expenses from to is the result of increased external and internal audit fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  and legal fees associated with employment agreements  stock repurchases  and our employee stock option program 
regulatory assessments were thousand in  compared to thousand in  and thousand in in november  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic finalized a rule intended to match an institution s deposit insurance premium to the risk an institution poses to the deposit insurance fund 
the final regulations adopt a new base schedule of rates that the fdic board could adjust up or down  depending on the revenue needs of the insurance fund 
during the third quarter of  we were assessed at the new deposit insurance rate retroactive to march  we anticipate regulatory assessment expenses of approximately thousand per quarter going forward at the current deposit levels 
loan funding expenses were million in  compared to million in  and million in the increase in loan funding expense is a result of the continued growth in our loan portfolio 
income taxes for  the tax expense was million  for an effective rate of  for  the tax expense was million  for an effective rate of  and for the tax expense was million  for an effective rate of 
the decrease in the effective rate for was largely due to larger enterprise zone deductions in than in deferred tax assets totaled million at december   million at december   and million at december  over half of the deferred tax asset is due to the tax deductibility timing difference of the provision for loan losses 
financial condition general as of december   total assets increased to billion  compared to billion as of december  total gross loans increased to billion as of december   or  compared to billion as of december  deposits grew to billion as of december   compared to billion as of december  assets total assets were billion at december   compared to billion at december   a increase 
the increase was due to a million increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  and an increase in gross loans  including loans held for sale  outstanding of million 
asset growth is expected to continue due to the expansion of our branches  growth of the sba wholesale lending unit  and growth of the inland empire loan production unit 
total loans and loans held for sale  excluding deferred loan fees and allowance for loan loss  were billion at december   compared to billion at december   an increase 
much of the increase is due to increases in construction loans and sba loans 
our loan portfolio composition is primarily construction  commercial  sba  and real estate secured loans 
sba a loans  of which we are an active originator  consisting of both commercial and real estate loans  comprise approximately of loans outstanding at december  and  and as of december  approximately of the loan portfolio is in real estate secured loans as of december   compared to and for comparable periods in and  respectively 
at december   approximately of the loans were commercial loans  compared to approximately at december  even though there is softness in the residential loan market  the rate of loan growth for our bank is projected to be strong due to the addition of the inland empire loan production unit  the wholesale sba program  and growth of our branch system

at december   the sba servicing asset was million  the sba i o strip receivable was million  and the cash surrender value of life insurance was million 
loan portfolio moderate loan demand in resulted in a increase in commercial loans  a increase in construction lending  a decrease in real estate lending  and a increase in sba loans 
we originated brokered loans  totaling million in  compared with million in  and million in sales of mortgage loans totaled million in there were no sales of mortgage loans in and the servicing portfolio  which consists of sba loans sold to other investors  was million as of december   compared to million as of december   and million as of december  the majority of our loans have floating rates tied to wall street journal or other market rate indicators 
this serves to lessen the risk from movement in interest rates  particularly rate increases 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing interest  and other real estate owned oreo 
we had million of nonperforming assets as of december  of which million was guaranteed by the sba  compared to million of nonperforming assets as of december  of which million was guaranteed by the sba  and million of nonperforming assets as of december   of which million was government guaranteed

these loans are graded in the classified loan grades of substandard or doubtful or loss and include most nonperforming loans 
each classified loan is monitored at least monthly and more frequently  as necessary

risk management the investment of our funds is primarily in loans  where a greater degree of risk is normally assumed  than in other forms of investments 
sound underwriting of loans and continuing evaluations of the underlying collateral and performance of our borrowers are an integral part in the maintenance of a high level of quality in our total assets

these allocations are based upon loan type and loan classification  as well as market conditions for the underlying real estate and other collateral  trends in the real estate market  economic uncertainties  and other risks where it is probable that losses may be incurred 
in general  there are no loss allocations established for the government guaranteed portion of loans

as conditions change  our level of provision for loan loss and allowance for loan losses may change 
during the year ended december   we charged off million net of recoveries and provided million to the provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   we charged off thousand net of recoveries to the allowance while providing million to the provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   we charged off thousand net of recoveries and provided million to the provision for loan losses 
although we believe that we use the best information available to make determinations of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
during   and  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were only   and  respectively 
we have established loss allocations for each homogeneous category based upon loan type  as well as specific allocations for special mention and classified loans 
certain loan types may not have incurred charge offs or have historically had minimal losses  but it is probable that losses may be incurred 
we consider trends in delinquencies  potential charge offs by loan type  market for underlying real estate or other collateral  trends in industry types  economic changes and other risks 
accounting for the allowance for loan losses non homogenous exposures  representing individual credit exposures  are evaluated based upon the borrower s overall financial condition  resources  and payment record  the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors  and  if appropriate  the realizable value of any collateral 
the allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that begins with estimates of probable losses in the portfolio based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted in the loan s contractual effective rate  the secondary market value of the loan and the discounted fair value of collateral 
this analysis includes all special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss rated loans 
the credit administration review and expertise in analyzing and working out these loans is critical to the accuracy of this process 
each portfolio of homogeneous loans is collectively evaluated for loss potential 
the allowance for loan losses is established via a process that begins with estimates of probable incurred losses in the portfolio  based upon various statistical analyses 
these include historical credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
the analysis considers general factors such as changes in lending policies and procedures  economic trends  loan volume trends  changes in lending management and staff  trends in delinquencies  nonaccruals and charge offs  changes in loan review and board oversight  the effects of competition  legal and regulatory requirements  and factors inherent to each loan pool

servicing asset and interest only strips receivable servicing assets are recognized when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period which the change occurs 
the fair value of servicing assets is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at estimated future current market rates for the expected life of the loans 
we use industry prepayment statistics in estimating the expected life of the loan 
sba a loans can be sold for a premium or for par 
when an sba a loan is sold for a premium  the originator is required to retain at least interest on the sold portion of the loan 
the interest is considered the contractual servicing fee for the loan 
when an sba a loan is sold for par  the originator generally retains a much larger interest than the required contractual servicing 
the premium represents what the buyer is willing to pay the originator for the difference between the rates passed through to the buyer in a premium sale versus a par sale 
when we feel that the premium is not sufficient to compensate us for the future income resulting from the higher retained interest in a par sale  we will sell the loan at par versus a premium 
the servicing assets represent the value of the contractual servicing fee less costs to service in the sba industry have been considered basis points 
therefore  the servicing asset value is based upon the contractual servicing fee of generally  less servicing costs of basis points 
when the interest rate retained exceeds the contractual servicing fee  generally for sba a loans  the excess over is considered the i o 
at december    and  we had i o strips of million  million  and million respectively  which approximate fair value 
fair value is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows from the i o strips using assumptions similar to those used in valuing servicing assets 
in addition  we obtain a third party valuation on a quarterly basis 
the net servicing asset decreased to million as of december   compared to million as of december   and million as of december  the decrease reflects the decline in serviced assets from million at december  to million at december   the increase in discount rates used to value the servicing assets  and an increase in the prepayment assumptions 
the valuation of the servicing asset reflects estimates of the expected life of the underlying loans  which may be adversely affected by higher than expected levels of pay offs in periods of lower rates or charge offs in periods of economic difficulty 
in addition  when property values increase due to general economic conditions  borrowers have refinancing opportunities available to them which may result in higher prepayment rates

investments financial assets federal home loan bank fhlb stock and fnma mortgage backed security  was million at december  and million at december  federal reserve bank and fhlb stock  which are not included in the investment category  was million at december  we had million in fed funds sold at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  at the date of purchase  we are required to classify equity and debt securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
at each annual reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments classified as held to maturity are measured at amortized cost in the financial statements and can be so classified only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
for  the ratio of average interest earning assets to average total assets was  for it was and for it was 
our goal is to maintain at least of our assets as interest earning 
for the ratio remained below that level due to the sba servicing asset  the related sba interest only strip receivable  and the cash surrender value of life insurance 
even though these assets are not considered interest bearing for net interest margin purposes  they do produce  or are related to  income that is part of non interest income 
other assets premises and equipment  accrued interest  and deferred tax assets are the major components of other assets 
the changes in these items are as follows premises and equipment were million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively 
the decrease has mainly been due to upgrades to information technology systems and expansion of the number of branches and loan production offices offset by depreciation 
accrued interest was million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively 
the increase in accrued interest is a direct result of the increase in loans including loans held for sale 
average loan balances increased to billion for  compared to million for  and million for deferred tax assets were million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively 
over half of the deferred tax asset is due to the tax deductibility timing difference of the provision for loan loss 
deposits sources of funds we offer a variety of deposit accounts  having a wide range of interest rates and terms  consisting of demand  savings  money market  and time accounts 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies  customer service  and referrals to attract and retain these deposits 
deposits were billion at december   compared to billion at december   a million or increase 
demand deposits decreased million  money market and now accounts increased million  savings decreased million  and certificate of deposits cd s increased million  of which million were brokered deposits 
non interest bearing demand deposits comprised approximately of deposits at december   compared to at december  the loan to deposit ratio increased to at december  from at december  at december   approximately of deposits had balances of  or more and none of our customers excluding brokered deposits had balances that exceeded of our bank s deposits 
brokered cd deposits were million at december  and million at december  we prefer core deposits as a source of funds for our loan portfolio 
consequently  we take steps to attract solid core accounts while at the same time maintaining a reasonable funding cost 
the core deposit base has grown as a result of the addition of one branch in  two branches in  one branch in  and the continued deposit increases at our seven other branches 
we will continue to solicit core deposits to diminish reliance on volatile funds 
the increase in certificates of deposits is due to cd promotions during    and to fund the rapid loan growth  as well as the creation of a money desk department in and acquisition of brokered cd deposits in and certificates of deposits balances in the money desk department are deposits from other financial institutions 
as of december  these deposits totaled million 
the following table is a summary of our deposits by type and their percentage of distribution december  december  amount percent amount percent deposit composition dollars in thousands non interest bearing demand money market and now savings time deposits  under  time deposits   and over total deposits on november   the fdic finalized a rule intended to match an institution s deposit insurance premium to the risk an institution poses to the deposit insurance fund 
the final regulations adopt a new base schedule of rates that the fdic board could adjust up or down  depending on the revenue needs of the insurance fund 
the base rates range from to basis points for healthy banks  based on supervisory ratings and financial ratios  and debt ratings for large banks 
the new assessment rates were effective on january  and will vary between five and seven cents per of domestic deposits 
borrowings and junior subordinated debt we use fhlb borrowings to fund loan demand and to manage liquidity in light of deposit flows 
our borrowing capacity can be used to borrow under various fhlb loan programs  including adjustable and fixed rate financing  for periods ranging from one day to years  with a variety of interest rate structures available 
the borrowing capacity has no commitment fees or cost  requires minimum levels of investment in fhlb stock we receive dividend income on our investment in fhlb stock  can be withdrawn by the fhlb if there is any significant change in our financial or operating condition  and is conditional upon our compliance with certain agreements covering advances  collateral maintenance  eligibility  and documentation 
we are required to pledge a certain amount of loans with the fhlb for collateralization purposes 
as of december   million in loans  with an outstanding balance of million  was pledged for an aggregate borrowing line of million 
as of december   million in loans  with an outstanding balance of million  was pledged for an aggregate borrowing line of million

our borrowing capacity at the fhlb as of december  was million 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies are permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that will  subject to certain conditions  qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
the subordinated debentures are subordinated to all of our existing and future borrowings

as of december  we have included million of the net junior subordinated debt in our tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes 
as of december  and we have included million of the net junior subordinated debt in our tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes 
the remaining amount qualifies for tier ii capital treatment 
capital it is our goal to maintain capital levels within the regulatory well capitalized category 
we update our multiple year capital plan annually in conjunction with the preparation of the annual budget 
capital levels are always a primary concern of the federal regulatory authorities  and we submit capital plans to them when requested 
it is our strategy to maintain an adequate level of capital  which by definition excludes excessive as well as inadequate capital 
total capital was million at december  and million at december  for  the million  or increase  consisted of million of net income  million on the exercise of stock options  thousand of stock based compensation expense  a reduction of million for cash dividends  and a reduction of million for the repurchase and retirement of common stock 
for  the million  or increase  consisted of million of net income  a reduction of thousand in other comprehensive income  million on the exercise of stock options  million of stock based compensation expense  and million of proceeds from a private placement stock offering 
our average equity to average assets ratio was   and at december    and  respectively 
during  our board of directors authorized three cash dividends 
the first cash dividend was authorized in may  a per share cash dividend payable on july  to shareholders of record as of july  the second cash dividend was authorized in august  a per share cash dividend payable on october  to shareholders of record as of october  the third cash dividend was authorized in november  a per share cash dividend payable on january  to shareholders of record as of january  whether or not stock dividends  or any cash dividends  will be paid in the future will be determined by our board of directors after consideration of various factors 
our company s and our bank s profitability and regulatory capital ratios  in addition to other financial conditions  will be key factors considered by our board of directors in making such determinations regarding the payment of dividends 
total risk based capital was and tier one leverage capital was at december   compared to and at december  at december  and our bank was within the regulatory well capitalized category 
at the end of and  all bank capital ratios were above all current federal capital guidelines for a well capitalized bank 
our management considers capital requirements as part of our strategic planning process 
the strategic plan calls for continuing increases in assets and liabilities  and the capital required may therefore be in excess of retained earnings 
the ability to obtain capital is dependent upon the capital markets as well as performance of our company 
our management regularly evaluates sources of capital and the timing required to meet our strategic objectives 
the following tables present the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions and the capital ratios for our company and our bank at december    and minimum required for capital adequacy purposes actual ratio december  temecula valley bancorp tier leverage tier risk based capital total risk based capital minimum required for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions actual ratio december temecula valley bank tier leverage tier risk based capital total risk based capital in december  the federal banking agencies issued final guidance to reinforce sound risk management practices for bank holding companies and banks in commercial real estate cre loans 
the guidance establishes cre concentration thresholds as criteria for examiners to identify cre concentration that may warrant further analysis 
the implementation of these guidelines could result in increased reserves and capital costs for banks with cre concentration 
we believe that our cre portfolio as of december  does not have the risks associated with high cre concentration due to mitigating factors  including low loan to value ratios  adequate debt coverage ratios  and a wide variety of property types 
liquidity management our cash position is determined on a daily basis 
on a monthly basis  our board reviews our liquidity position 
one analysis measures the liquidity gap 
our guidelines state a positive liquidity gap position should be maintained 
at december   the liquidity gap position was 
another analysis measures an industry standard liquidity ratio 
our guidelines state a ratio or more should be maintained 
at december  the ratio was 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from growth in customer deposits and financing activities which includes federal funds lines of credit at correspondent banks and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
we maintain federal funds lines of credit of million for short term liquidity 
in addition  we have created a borrowing capacity at the fhlb that fluctuates with loan balances pledged as collateral 
at december   our borrowing capacity with the fhlb was million and at december  was million 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  and sales and participations of eligible loans 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of deposits  interest paid on deposits and borrowings  originations of loans  and payment of operating expenses 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate 
at december   we were not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
banks are in the business of managing money 
consequently  funds management is essential to the ongoing profitability of a bank 
a bank must attract funds at a reasonable rate and deploy the funds at an appropriate rate of return  while taking into account risk factors  interest rates  short and long term liquidity positions  and profitability needs 
liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed monthly by our board of directors 
we experienced net cash used by operating activities of million during the  million during  and million during net cash provided by investing activities of million during  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million during  and million during the change in was primarily the result of the purchase of the unguaranteed portion of a loans and the decreased loan growth in the current year compared to strong growth in the prior year 
we experienced net cash provided by financing activities of million during  million during  and million during the change in was primarily the result of the repayment of a junior subordinated debt security  repurchase and retirement of common stock  offset by a lower increase in time deposits 
the liquidity of our parent company is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by our bank  subject to restrictions set forth by california banking law as well as other regulatory instructions 
the bank paid million in dividends to the company in for the year ended december  and  no dividends were paid by our bank to our company 
contractual obligations and commitments at december   we had commitments to extend credit of million and obligations under letters of credit of million 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
commitments are generally variable rate  and many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
as such  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we use the same credit underwriting policies in granting or accepting such commitments or contingent obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments  which consist of evaluating customers creditworthiness individually 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the financial performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
when deemed necessary  we hold appropriate collateral supporting those commitments 
we do not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions

in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon our financial results 
certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and are considered critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant accounting policies followed by our company are presented in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses  stock based compensation expense  sba servicing assets  and sba i o strips to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of our board 
we are most affected by interest rate risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk  are not significant to us in the normal course of our business activities 
market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
asset liability management interest rate risk irr and credit risk are the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon our net interest income nii 
changes in the nii are the result of changes in the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
we realize a significant portion of our income from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets  and the interest incurred on deposits and borrowings 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits  and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices 
the majority of the adjustable rate loans are tied to the wall street journal prime rate and reprice immediately 
the exception is a loans  which reprice on the first day of the subsequent quarter after a change in prime 
as of december   approximately of our deposits were time deposits with a stated maturity generally one year or less and a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   of our junior subordinated debt was floating rate with a remaining term of years 
changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect our interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizon  is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by our board 
we do not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  but instead maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools which enable us to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
our primary tool in managing interest rate risk is the effect of interest rate shocks on the net interest income 
the following shows our projected net interest income sensitivity for based on asset and liability levels using the december  net interest income as a starting point 
for purposes of this table  there is assumed to be zero growth in loans  investments  deposits  or other components of the balance sheet 
at december   our internal prime rate was and wall street journal prime rate was changes in projected net change from change from rates interest income base case base case dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp in the model  a rising rate environment will increase net interest income nii from a flat rate environment 
a lower rate environment will decrease net interest income 
the analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon various assumptions 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategy 
while the assumptions are developed upon current economic and market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions our board might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
