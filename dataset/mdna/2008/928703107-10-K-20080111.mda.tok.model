critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

for those contracts accounted for under sop no 
 the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts when losses become evident 
accumulated unbilled costs on contracts are carried in inventory at the lower of actual cost or estimated realizable value 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued allowance for uncollectible accounts the establishment of an allowance requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding potential losses on receivable balances 
allowances for accounts receivable are maintained based upon historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history 
the company also makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based upon ongoing credit evaluations  and might assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
however  since a reliable prediction of future changes in the financial stability of customers is not possible  the company cannot guarantee that allowances will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly higher or lower than the allowance established  it would require a related charge or credit to earnings 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing using fair value methodologies 
the company performs its annual impairment testing during its second fiscal quarter  or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the impairment test may result in charges to earnings in the second fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
the testing process includes the comparison of the company s business units multiples of sales and ebitda to those multiples of its business units competitors 
although it is believed the assumptions and estimates made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact financial results 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost  and depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line or accelerated methods at rates calculated to allocate the cost of the assets over their period of use 
intangible assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 these assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  the accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
capitalized software the company s software technology personnel are involved in the development and acquisition of internal use software to be used in its enterprise resource planning system and software used in its operating segments  some of which are customer accessible 
the company accounts for the capitalization of software in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
subsequent to the preliminary project planning and approval stage  all appropriate costs are capitalized until the point at which the software is ready for its intended use 
subsequent to the software being used in operations  the capitalized costs are transferred from costs in process to completed property  plant and equipment  and are accounted for as such 
all post implementation costs  such as maintenance  training and minor upgrades that do not result in additional functionality  are expensed as incurred 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued the capitalization process involves judgment as to what types of projects and tasks are capitalizable 
although the company believes the decisions made in the past concerning the accounting treatment of these software costs have been reasonable and appropriate  different decisions could materially impact financial results 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance when the financial statements are prepared  the company estimates its income taxes based on the various jurisdictions in which business is conducted 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide income tax provision 
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions are based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
the recognition of these provisions for income taxes is recorded in the period in which it is determined that such taxes are due 
if in a later period it is determined that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary  a reversal of the liability is recognized 
as a result  the ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease the effective tax rate and materially affect the company s operating results 
this also requires the company to estimate its current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are reflected on the balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent it is believed that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
when a valuation allowance is increased or decreased  a corresponding tax expense or benefit is recorded in the statement of operations 
the deferred tax asset at october  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was recorded to reflect uncertainties about whether the company will be able to utilize some of its deferred tax assets consisting primarily of foreign net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income for the applicable jurisdictions and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be realizable 
securitization program the company accounts for the securitization of accounts receivable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets an amendment of sfas no 
at the time a participation interest in the receivables is sold  that interest is removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
the outstanding balance of the undivided interest sold to three rivers funding corporation trfco  an asset backed commercial paper conduit sponsored by mellon bank  na  was million at october  and million at october   respectively 
accordingly  the trade receivables included on the october  and october  balance sheets have been reduced to reflect the participation interest sold 
trfco has no recourse to the company beyond its interest in the pool of receivables owned by volt funding  a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of the company for any of the sold receivables 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued primary casualty insurance program the company is insured with highly rated insurance companies under a program that provides primary workers compensation  employer s liability  general liability and automobile liability insurance under a loss sensitive program 
in certain mandated states  the company purchases workers compensation insurance through participation in state funds  and the experience rated premiums in these state plans relieve the company of any additional liability 
in the loss sensitive program  initial premium accruals are established based upon the underlying exposure  such as the amount and type of labor utilized  number of vehicles  etc 
the company establishes accruals utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims  including an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
this process also includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate premium liability 
in preparing the estimates  the company considers the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party actuaries  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
the insurance policies have various premium rating plans that establish the ultimate premium to be paid 
adjustments to premiums are based upon the level of claims incurred at a future date up to three years after the end of the respective policy year 
for each policy year  management evaluates the accrual and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
the ultimate premium cost may be greater or less than the established accrual 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
in the event it is determined that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate  the company would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which such determination is made 
in fiscal and  as a result of its review of its insurance accruals  the company reduced cost of sales by approximately million and million  respectively  to reduce its workers compensation accruals due to its working closely with customers to better manage workers compensation costs  and to the improved regulatory environment within several states 
the company is anticipating a slight increase to workers compensation costs during fiscal and thereafter 
the company also reduced cost of sales by approximately million and million  respectively  to recognize a reduction in general liability insurance costs as a result of retrospective adjustments related to the company s positive claims experience 
medical insurance program the company is self insured for the majority of its medical benefit programs 
the company remains insured for a portion of its medical program primarily hmos as well as the entire dental program 
the company provides the self insured medical benefits through an arrangement with a third party administrator 
however  the liability for the self insured benefits is limited by the purchase of stop loss insurance 
the contributed and withheld funds and related liabilities for the self insured program together with unpaid premiums for the insured programs are held in a c employee welfare benefit trust 
these amounts  other than the current provisions  do not appear on the balance sheet of the company 
in order to establish the self insurance reserves  the company utilized actuarial estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical data 
the provision for future payments is initially adjusted by the enrollment levels in the various plans 
periodically  the resulting liabilities are monitored and adjusted as warranted by changing circumstances 
should the amount of claims occurring exceed what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  liabilities might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded by the company

the company s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company s internal management structure  which is based on operating activities 
the company evaluates performance based upon several factors  of which the primary financial measure is segment operating profit 
the company defines operating profit as pre tax income  before general corporate expenses  interest income and expense  and other non operating income and expense items 
operating profit provides management  investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze operating performance of each business segment against historical and competitors data  although historical results  including operating profit  may not be indicative of future results  as operating profit is highly contingent on many factors  including the state of the economy and customer preferences 
several historical seasonal factors usually affect the sales and profits of the company 
the staffing services segment s sales and operating profit are always lowest in the company s first fiscal quarter due to the thanksgiving  christmas and new year holidays  as well as certain customer facilities closing for one to two weeks 
during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year  this segment benefits from a reduction of payroll taxes when the annual tax contributions for higher salaried employees have been met  and customers increase the use of the company s administrative and industrial labor during the summer vacation period 
in addition  the telephone directory segment s datanational division publishes more directories during the second half of the fiscal year

the telephone directory segment sales and operating profits increased in fiscal from the prior fiscal year  with operating profits reaching an historical high for the segment 
the million increase in operating profit was due to the sales increase and the increase in gross percentages due to the mix of telephone directories delivered in the year 
in the telecommunications services segment  sales increased slightly in fiscal from the fiscal year 
operating results improved by million  as the segment recorded its first operating profit in six years due to the ramping up of a major fiber optic contract in the latter half of fiscal the gross margin percentages improved in fiscal due to the mix of jobs completed during the period 
overhead costs decreased in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the computer systems segment s sales and operating profits increased in fiscal from the prior fiscal year  with segment sales reaching an historical high 
gross margin percentages increased in fiscal due to the mix of the various revenue components  and overhead costs increased in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the company has focused  and will continue to focus  on aggressively increasing its market share while attempting to maintain margins in order to increase profits 
despite an increase in costs to solidify and expand their presence in their respective markets  the segments have emphasized cost containment measures  along with improved credit and collections procedures designed to improve the company s cash flow

the increased gross margin percentage was primarily due to the mix of jobs completed in the current year as compared to the prior year  specifically the higher margins recognized from the construction and engineering s new fiber optic  utility and government jobs 
the improvement in margins was partially offset by an increase in workers compensation costs of approximately percentage points as a percentage of direct labor as compared to the prior year  even though the workers compensation rates are still lower than historical levels within this segment 
the results of the segment continue to be affected by the decline in capital spending by telephone companies caused by the consolidation within the segment s telecommunications industry wire line customer base and an increasing shift by consumers to wireless communications and alternatives
