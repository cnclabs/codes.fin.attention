this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements reflect our current view with respect to future events and financial performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under cautionary statement included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report  that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results 
overview we are the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations 
our products and services enable nonprofit organizations to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve communications with constituents  manage finances and optimize internal operations 
we have focused solely on the nonprofit market since our incorporation in and have developed our suite of products and services based upon our extensive knowledge of the operating challenges facing nonprofit organizations 
at the end of  we had approximately  customers 
our customers operate in multiple verticals within the nonprofit market  including education  foundations  health and human services  religion  arts and cultural  public and societal benefits  environment and animal welfare and international foreign affairs 
we derive revenue from selling perpetual licenses or charging for the use of our software products and providing a broad offering of services  including consulting  training  installation  implementation  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training and implementation are generally not essential to the functionality of our software products and are sold separately 
furthermore  we derive revenue from providing hosting services  performing donor prospect research engagements  selling lists of potential donors  providing benchmarking studies and data modeling services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to our revenue recognition  our allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  stock based compensation and provision for income taxes  valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we are not aware of any circumstances in the past that have caused these estimates and assumptions to be materially wrong 
furthermore  we are not currently aware of any material changes in our business that might cause these assumptions or estimates to differ significantly 
in our discussion below of deferred taxes  the most significant asset subject to such assumptions and estimates  we have described the sensitivity of these assumptions or estimates to potential deviations in actual results 
actual results could differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily by selling perpetual licenses or charging for the use of our software products and providing support  training  consulting  technical and other professional services for those products 
we make available certain software products for use in hosted application arrangements without licensing perpetual rights to the software hosted applications 
additionally we provide hosting services to customers who have purchased perpetual rights to certain of our software products hosting services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statements of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sops and  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no

 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and the sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual license rights to software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we deem acceptance of an agreement to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted 
our typical license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions  if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond its customary payment terms 
we deem collection probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we postpone recognition of the revenue until cash collection 
we sell software licenses with maintenance and  often times  professional services 
we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
fair value for the maintenance services associated with our software licenses is based upon renewal rates stated in our agreements  which vary according to the level of the maintenance program 
fair value of professional services and other products and services is based on sales of these products and services to other customers when sold on a stand alone basis 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
as we develop new products  we may experience difficulty in determining vsoe regarding the fair value of those new products 
this would result in the deferral of revenue on those transactions until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or until vsoe is established 
our services  which include consulting  installation and implementation services  are generally billed based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
for small service engagements  less than approximately  we frequently contract for and bill based on a fixed fee plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
we recognize this revenue upon completion of the work performed 
when our services include software customization  these services are provided to support customer requests for assistance in creating special reports and other minor enhancements that will assist with efforts to improve operational efficiency and or to support business process improvements 
these services are not essential to the functionality of our software and rarely 
table of contents 
index to financial statements exceed three months in duration 
we recognize revenue as these services are performed 
when we enter into larger fixed price contracts  we recognize revenue on a percent complete basis 
we recognize analytic services revenue from donor prospect research engagements  sales of lists of potential donors  benchmarking studies and data modeling service engagements upon delivery 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class  at a per attendee price  or at a packaged price for several attendees  and revenue is recognized only upon the customer attending and completing training 
additionally  we sell a fixed rate program  which permits customers to attend unlimited training over a specified contract period  typically one year  subject to certain restrictions  and revenue is recognized ratably over this contract period 
we recognize revenue from maintenance services ratably over the contract term  which is principally one year 
maintenance revenue also includes the right to unspecified product upgrades on an if and when available basis 
certain support services are sold in prepaid units of time and recognized as revenue upon their usage 
subscription revenue includes revenue associated with hosted applications  hosting services  data enrichment services  data management services and online training programs 
subscription based revenue and any related set up fees are recognized ratably over the service period of the contract 
to the extent that our customers are billed and or pay for the above described services in advance of delivery  the amounts are recorded in deferred revenue 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customers a day right of return and maintain a reserve for returns 
we estimate the amount of this reserve based on historical experience 
provisions for sales returns are charged against the related revenue items 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
any necessary provision is reflected in general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we use the undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of our risks and required investment returns at the time the impairment assessment is made 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we test goodwill for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value  which could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill is assigned to various reporting units 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the determination of the fair value of the stock options and stock appreciation rights is made using an option pricing model and requires us to use significant judgment to make estimates regarding the life of the award  volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate and the dividend yield of our stock over the life of the award 
changes to these estimates would result in different fair values of awards 
sfas no 
r requires us to estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited and recognize expense only for those awards that ultimately vest 
significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to compensation expense for estimated forfeitures 
compensation expense in a period could be impacted  favorably or unfavorably  by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to grants made after the adoption date and existing grants which were partially unvested at that date 
compensation expense for grants outstanding on the date of adoption are recognized over the remaining service period using the grant date fair values and amortization methods determined previously for the sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  pro forma disclosures 
provision for income tax and valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in a net deferred tax asset  which is included on our consolidated balance sheets 
the final tax outcome of these matters might be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  benefits and accruals 
any difference could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
prior to october   we were organized as an s corporation under the internal revenue code and  therefore  were not subject to federal income taxes 
in addition  we were not subject to income tax in many of the states in which we operated as a result of our s corporation status 
we historically made distributions to our stockholders to cover the stockholders anticipated tax liability 
in connection with our recapitalization  we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements converted our us taxable status from an s corporation to a c corporation 
accordingly  since october  we have been subject to federal and state income taxes 
upon the conversion and in connection with the recapitalization  we recorded a one time benefit of million to establish a deferred tax asset 
we must assess the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
except with respect to certain state income tax credits  we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  and  because we expect to be able to utilize our entire net deferred tax asset 
the ability to utilize our net deferred tax asset is solely dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
based on current estimates of revenue and expenses  we expect future taxable income will be more than sufficient to recover the annual amount of additional tax deductions permitted 
even if actual results are significantly below our current estimates  the recovery still remains likely and no valuation allowance would be necessary 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
to the extent that the final results differ from these estimated amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and could have an impact on the deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at an amount based upon a us federal income tax rate of 
if our projected taxable income falls and our tax rate decreases  we will adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount reflecting a reduced expected us federal income tax rate 
if such change is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  fin on january  under fin we must recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as tax expense 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions and in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and  therefore  the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain 
these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by us 
although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters  we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any particular period

this method results in the recognition of more expense in the earlier periods of vesting when compared with the straight line method of amortization  which results in equal amounts of expense in all vesting periods 
furthermore  there have been no new grants of stock options since the decrease in stock option expense is partially offset by an increase in compensation expense from restricted stock awards due to an increase in number of awards granted and their associated amortization 
additionally  grants of stock appreciation rights  which began in the fourth quarter of  contributed to an increase in stock based compensation expense for compared to the total amount of compensation costs related to non vested awards not yet recognized was  as of december  this amount will be recognized over a weighted average period of years

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  certain of our options were accounted for as variable awards under the provisions of apb no 
 which required us to record deferred compensation  and recognize compensation expense over the requisite vesting period  for the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock at each reporting date 
the increase in stock based compensation expense related to stock options in compared to is due the recognition of expense related to the unamortized portion of the fair value of the awards existing at the adoption of sfas no

the treatment of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is the same under sfas no 
r and apb therefore  the increase in stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards in is from the impact of a full year of expense in from awards granted in late amortization amortization expense is allocated according to the nature of the respective identifiable intangible asset and  to the extent associated directly with revenue  we allocate amortization expense to the respective cost of revenue

table of contents 
index to financial statements significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to the timing differences or a change in a valuation reserve is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
in and  we increased our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million and million  respectively  for state credits that are expected to expire unused 
in  we recognized an income tax benefit of million related to changes in state income tax credits 
our deferred tax asset at december  included state income tax credits  net of federal taxes at  of approximately million that expire between and we established a full valuation allowance against these credits when the asset was recorded because  based on information available at that time  it was not deemed probable that these credits would be realized 
during  as a result of profitable results in and  expectations of future profitability and utilization of all related state net operating losses  we released million of the valuation allowance related to these state income tax credits which resulted in a credit to income tax expense for additionally  certain other state tax credits whose use was previously restricted to reducing state franchise taxes became available to offset state income tax as a result of a clarification in enacted tax law during accordingly  a deferred tax asset was established during in the amount of million  net of federal taxes at  related to the associated future reduction of state income taxes which resulted in an additional credit to income tax expense for a valuation allowance was established for million of the million representing the portion of the credits not deemed more likely than not to be utilized which resulted in a debit to income tax expense for the net effect of these items related to state income tax credits was a decrease in our income tax expense of million 
we continue to evaluate the realizability of the remaining state tax credits and any further adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period we determine it is more likely than not any of the remaining credits will be utilized 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at an amount based upon a us federal income tax rate of and appropriate statutory tax rates of various foreign  state and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
if our tax rates change in the future  we may adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount reflecting those income tax rates 
if such change is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a million reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of january   the date of adoption  was million  of which million would impact our effective rate if recognized

we have taken positions in certain taxing jurisdictions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may significantly decrease within the next twelve months
