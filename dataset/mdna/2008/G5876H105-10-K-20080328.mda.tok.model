item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed under item a risk factors 
these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading global semiconductor provider of high performance analog  mixed signal  digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits 
our diverse product portfolio includes storage  switching  transceiver  cellular and handheld  wireless  pc connectivity  gateways  communications controller and power management solutions that serve diverse applications used in business enterprises  consumer electronics and emerging markets 
we are a fabless integrated circuit company  which means that we rely on independent  third party contractors to perform manufacturing  assembly and test functions 
this approach allows us to focus on designing  developing and marketing our products and significantly reduces the amount of capital we need to invest in manufacturing products 
in february  we acquired the semiconductor design business of utstarcom  inc for million  including contingent consideration of million subsequently recognized when milestones were achieved 
this business designs and supplies chipsets for personal handy phone applications 
in may  we acquired the printer semiconductor business of avago technologies limited for million  including earnout considerations of million subsequently recognized during fiscal and fiscal based on the achievement of a certain level of revenue 
this business designs and develops system on chip and system level solutions for both inkjet and laser jet printer systems 
in november  we completed the acquisition of the communications and application processor business of intel corporation for approximately million 
the communications and application processor business of intel designs and develops cellular baseband processors for multi mode  multi band wireless handheld devices such as cellular handsets  pdas and smartphones 
in addition  we have also completed several smaller acquisitions over the last fiscal years 
we offer our customers a wide range of high performance analog  mixed signal  digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits 
our products can be utilized in a wide array of enterprise applications including hard disk drives  high speed networking equipment  pcs  wlan solutions for soho and residential gateway solutions  and consumer applications such as cell phones  printers  digital cameras  mp devices  speakers  game consoles and pdas 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to one significant customer 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to three significant customers  each of which accounted for or more of our net revenue during the period 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to four significant customers  each of which accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
also  in fiscal  and  one distributor accounted for less than  less than and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
in addition  most of our sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
sales to customers in asia represented approximately  and of our net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of our customers are located in asia  we expect that most of our revenue will continue to be represented by sales to our customers in that region 
substantially all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  which may cause us to experience a delay between the time we incur expenses and the time revenue is generated from these expenditures 
we expect to increase our research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenditures as we seek to expand our operations 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders and shipments will vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and future quarters may be adversely affected 
our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january in a week year  each fiscal quarter consists of weeks 
the additional week in a week year is added to the fourth quarter  making such quarter consist of weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks while fiscal years and were comprised of weeks 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we account for our revenues under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
under this provision  we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
however  some of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and rights of return on product unsold by the distributors 
product revenue on sales made through distributors with rights of return and price protection is deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers 
our sales to direct customers are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
we generally allow customers to cancel or change purchase orders with limited notice prior to the scheduled shipment dates and from time to time we also may request a customer to accept a shipment of product before the original requested delivery date  in which case revenue is not recognized until there is written confirmation from the customer accepting early shipment  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
additionally  collection is not deemed to be reasonably assured if customers receive extended payment terms 
as a result  revenue on sales to customers with payment terms substantially greater than our normal payment terms is deferred and is recognized as revenue when payments become due 
deferred revenue less the related cost of the inventories is reported as deferred income 
the provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales is recorded in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
actual returns could differ from these estimates 
we also enter into development agreements with some of our customers 
under these development agreements product revenue is recognized under the proportionate performance method 
revenue is recognized as related costs to complete the contract are incurred 
these costs are included in research and development expense 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables apply to sales arrangements with multiple arrangements that include a combination of hardware  software and or services 
for multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on fair value 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
if the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  no revenue is recognized 
undelivered elements typically are software warranty and maintenance services 
in arrangements that include a combination of hardware and software products that are also sold separately  where software is more than incidental and essential to the functionality of the product being sold  the company follows the guidance in eitf issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  accounts for the entire arrangement as a sale of software and software related items and follows the revenue recognition criteria in sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
revenue from licensed software is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue from post contract customer support and any other future deliverables is deferred and earned over the support period or as contract elements are delivered 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards to employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes previous accounting guidance under accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
under sfas r  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost has to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this may reduce future net cash flows from operations and increase future net financing cash flows 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance regarding the interaction of sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb and related guidance  under the accelerated method of amortization 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  our results of operations include compensation costs of unvested options granted prior to january   and options granted subsequent to that date 
for grants prior to january   we amortize stock based compensation expense under the accelerated method 
for grants from january   we amortize stock based compensation expense ratably over the vesting term 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  our stock based compensation increased from million in fiscal to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
we have estimated the fair value of each award as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable 
the black scholes model considers  among other factors  the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
we established the expected term for employee options and awards  as well as expected forfeiture rates  based on the historical settlement experience and after giving consideration to vesting schedules 
assumptions for option exercises and pre vesting terminations of options were stratified by employee groups with sufficiently distinct behavior patterns 
under sfas  expected terms were based on similar assumptions for all employees  taken as a whole 
the risk factor interest rate which we apply to grants quarterly is based on the average rate of the prior quarter as published by the us treasury for five year us treasury constant maturities 
expected volatility under sfas r was developed based on the average of our historical daily stock price volatility 
although the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r and sab  the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our awards as it does not consider other factors important to those share based payment awards  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements  and limited transferability 
sfas r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
from january   stock based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense was recorded only for those stock based awards that are expected to vest 
previously under apb  previously recognized expense was reversed for the portion of awards forfeited prior to vesting as and when forfeitures occurred 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented deferred compensation as a separate component of stockholders equity 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  on january   we eliminated unamortized deferred compensation totaling million on that date with a corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
accounting for income taxes 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our judgments are based on the relative weight of both positive and negative evidence regarding future taxable income  and may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  tax planning strategies or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holiday benefits in each geographic region  the availability of tax credits and carryforwards  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin the adoption of fin did not result in any reclassifications of uncertain income tax liabilities and did not have a cumulative impact to retained earnings 
prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the best estimate of known tax contingencies 
fin no 
requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
fin permits us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of success upon settlement 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and related regulations 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  the availability of tax credits and carryforwards  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  and the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the internal revenue service notified our us subsidiaries that fiscal through would be audited and would include an audit of section a and payroll tax issues arising out of the stock option investigation 
in fiscal  we accrued million of section a liabilities for each of the restated years including interest and penalties  accrued payroll taxes including interest and penalties  where applicable 
we elected to join and completed the irs program announcement and its california equivalent 
through the close of fiscal we paid million for section a liabilities under the available programs  including interest and penalties where applicable 
during fiscal  based on development of our irs payroll tax audit  we accrued an additional penalty of million related to the conversion of incentive stock options into nonstatutory stock options due to the mispricing of the original option grant 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
the company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
investments 
investments designated as available for sale securities under sfas no 
 accounting for investment in certain debt and equity securities  are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on quoted market prices for financial instruments with similar characteristics 
unrealized gains and losses of our available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
additionally  we assess whether an other than temporary impairment loss on our available for sale securities has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are recorded as an impairment of investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
in general  investments with original maturities of greater than ninety days and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with maturities beyond one year may also be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such investments represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
we also invest in auction rate securities that are typically over collateralized by pools of loans originated under the federal family education loan program  or ffelp  and are guaranteed by the us department of education  and insured 
in addition  all auction rate securities held are rated by one or more of the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa at the time of purchase 
historically  all auction rate securities were classified as short term investments because we have been able to liquidate these at our direction on seven day  twenty eight day or thirty five day auction cycles 
when auction rate securities fail to clear at auction  which occurred with respect to a portion of our securities in february and to all of our auction rate securities in march  and we are unable to estimate when the impacted auction rate securities will clear at the next auction  we classify these as long term  consistent with the stated contractual maturities of the securities 
we believe that we have the ability to hold these securities for longer than a period of twelve months 
the stated or contractual maturities for these securities generally are between to years 
a failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
accounts receivable and allowances 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the realization of our accounts receivable and our results of operations 
the accounts receivable allowance recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of february  is million 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
inventory acquired under the supply agreement with intel are at prices above what a market participant could obtain from independent foundries and assembly test subcontractors  therefore  we write down inventory on hand to fair value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross margin at the time the related inventory is sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in charges for inventory excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal compared to fiscal is largely due to higher inventory balances as well as increased volatility in our demand forecast during fiscal valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we generally assess long lived and intangible assets on a quarterly basis 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that certain of the acquisition related intangibles associated with our acquisition of the utstarcom business and the intel communication and applications processor business were impaired primarily due to revised lower revenue forecasts associated with products incorporating such purchased intangibles 
we measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values  which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows 
we determined the fair value of the acquisition related intangible assets based on the most current financial forecast available 
the discount rate used to discount net cash flows to their present values was which was determined after consideration of our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the amount of the purchased intangibles written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to impairment was million 
we intend to continue to perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we are required to perform annual assessments of goodwill impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger a goodwill impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and v a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
the annual impairment test required under sfas was completed in the fourth quarter and did not identify any impairment of goodwill 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there can be no assurance these actions or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future  which may adversely impact gross margins 
we are aggressively defending these litigation matters and believe no material adverse outcome will result 
however  given uncertainties associated with any litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a probable loss or probable range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in certain companies 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  is million 
results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
years ended february  january  january  net revenue operating costs and expenses cost of goods sold research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization and write off of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and other acquired in process research and development restructuring total operating costs and expenses operating loss income interest and other income interest expense loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes loss income before change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax effect net loss income years ended february  and january  net revenue years ended february  january  change in net revenue   net revenue consists primarily of product revenue from sales of our semiconductor devices  and to a much lesser extent  development revenue derived from development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances and rebates 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a significant increase in volume shipments of our cellular and handset products  storage socs  wireless products and printer semiconductor solution products 
the increase in net revenue for cellular and handset products was due to a full year of revenue from the acquisition of the applications and communications processor business from intel corporation in november additionally  the increases in net revenue were primarily due to increased acceptance of our storage soc products by hard disk drive manufacturers and market share gains in the pc desktop and consumer product markets with our storage soc products and volume shipments of our wireless products from new design wins in consumer applications 
the net revenue increase in printer semiconductor solution products was also due to a full year of revenue from initial product shipments from our acquisition of the printer semiconductor business from avago in may net revenue derived from development contracts decreased in fiscal in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue compared to fiscal  and represented less than of net revenue for each year 
cost of goods sold years ended february  january  change in cost of goods sold   of net revenue gross margin cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and testing of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  product warranty costs  royalties and compensation and associated costs relating to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel  including stock based compensation and excess and obsolescence provisions and purchase accounting adjustments 
gross margin is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower gross margins from the cellular and handset products which commenced shipment in november as a result of the acquisition of the communications and applications processor business from intel  and due to higher inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
the inventory excess and obsolescence provision increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  respectively 
the increase in excess and obsolescence was due to the mix and quantities on hand compared to forecasted demand for such products on hand including communications and applications processor products and wireless products 
the cellular and handset inventory that we were contractually obligated to purchase under a supply agreement with intel were recorded at estimated fair value as required under purchase accounting 
although we have met the contractual obligations under the original supply agreement and transitioned certain products to our fabrication partners  we anticipate that we will continue to source certain legacy application processor cellular and handset inventory from intel pursuant to the terms of an amendment to the supply agreement 
we recorded such inventory at what we believe to be above market cost  which will adversely impact our gross margins relative to periods where we primarily purchased inventory at the minimum committed level 
the intel supply agreement required us to purchase inventory earlier than anticipated product shipments to our customers resulting in higher levels of inventory and associated carrying costs 
as a result  the higher levels of inventory increase our risk of holding excess and obsolete inventory 
our gross margins may also fluctuate in future periods due to  among other things  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing of production ramps of new products  increased pricing pressures from our customers and competitors  particularly in the consumer product markets that we are targeting  charges for obsolete or potentially excess inventory  changes in the costs charged by our manufacturing and test subcontractors  the introduction of new products with lower margins  product warranty costs and changes in the amount of development revenue recognized 
research and development and other years ended february  january  change in research and development and other   of net revenue research and development and other expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  stock based compensation expenses  prototype costs  depreciation and amortization expense  patent investigation and filing fees  costs associated with contract development work and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to additional development personnel to support the growth of our business as well as additional personnel related to our acquisitions of the communications and applications processor business of intel in november and the printer semiconductor business from avago in may which together resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
in addition  research and development costs increased due to additional stock based compensation expenses of million 
additionally  we incurred increased depreciation and amortization expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses  increased costs of million for prototype and related product tape out costs for new product initiatives  increased costs of million for tooling and engineering equipment expenses  increased costs of million for patent filing fees to protect newly developed intellectual property and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
research and development related costs for the year ended february  were million  as compared to million for the year ended january   an increase of million or selling and marketing years ended february  january  change in selling and marketing   of net revenue selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to sales and marketing personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  sales commissions  promotional and other marketing expenses  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in selling and marketing expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
in addition  selling and marketing expense increased due to increased stock based compensation expenses of million 
we also incurred higher commission costs of million due primarily to the increase in sales and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
general and administrative years ended february  january  change in general and administrative   of net revenue general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to general and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  fees for professional services and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher attorney and professional fees of million associated with our internal review by a special committee of the board of directors related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting matters 
general and administrative expense in fiscal also included million accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to anticipated payments pursuant to a tentative settlement in connection with derivative lawsuits related to historical stock option practices 
in addition  general and administrative expense increased due to the net hiring of additional administrative personnel  which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
partially offsetting the increase in general and administrative expense was a decrease in stock based compensation expenses of million and a million gain from the sale of an asset under construction 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional general and administrative personnel to support our worldwide operations 
amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other years ended february  january  change in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other of net revenue in fiscal  we made two acquisitions in which we acquired intangible assets which are being amortized over their estimated economic lives of one to seven years 
in fiscal  we made five acquisitions in which we acquired intangible assets which are being amortized over their estimated economic lives of one to eight years 
the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the effects of a full year of amortization from the acquisitions made in fiscal as well as amortization of intangible assets from fiscal acquisitions 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
accordingly  we also assessed the recoverability of the acquisition related intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances could be recovered through their respective estimated undiscounted future net cash flows 
we determined that certain of the acquisition related intangibles associated with our acquisition of the utstarcom business and the intel communication and applications processor business were impaired primarily due to the revised lower revenue forecasts associated with products incorporation such purchased intangibles 
we measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values  which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows 
the amount of the purchased intangibles written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to impairment was million 
acquired in process research and development years ended february  january  change in acquired in process research and development  of net revenue in connection with the acquisition of the communications and application processor business of intel corporation on november   we purchased in process research and development iprd of approximately million 
the amounts allocated to iprd were determined based on our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired using valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were charged to expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal the projects that qualify for iprd had not reached technical feasibility and no future use existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 amounts assigned to iprd meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
the value assigned to in process research and technology was determined by considering the importance of products under development to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the fair values of iprd were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect additional risks related to the product s development and success as well as the product s stage of completion 
discount rates of to were used for valuing the iprd 
at the time of the acquisition  there were three significant projects in process that were approximately complete with estimated aggregate costs to complete of million 
the projects were completed during fiscal the estimates used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
restructuring years ended february  january  change in restructuring  of net revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan which included reductions in workforce in all functions of the organization worldwide in order to reduce our cost structure 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded relating to severance and benefits to terminated employees 
all expenses associated with our restructuring plan are included in restructuring in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
for further discussion on our restructuring plan  please refer to note  restructuring 
interest and other income years ended february  january  change in interest and other income   of net revenue interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  and gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities 
the increase in interest and other income is due primarily to a one time benefit of million credited to other income to the reflect the release of unused credits arising from differences in the original estimate used in purchase accounting and actual product mix and yields from the supply agreement with intel 
partially offsetting the increase in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal was lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances for comparable periods as well as a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense years ended february  january  change in interest expense   of net revenue interest expense consists primarily of interest paid on debt and capital lease obligations 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the effects of a full year of interest expense on a term loan obligation and supply agreement incurred in november see note for further discussion on the term loan obligation and note for more information on the intel supply agreement 
provision for income taxes years ended february  january  change in provision for income taxes   of net revenue our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in the fiscal effective tax rate compared to fiscal was primarily due to foreign subsidiary net operating losses which were made available by restructuring of certain foreign entities as well as a reduction in the unrecognized tax benefits due to closure of foreign audits and lapsing of statutes of limitations 
we continued to incur significant non tax deductible expenses such as stock based compensation  acquisition related expenses and intangible amortization resulting in lower profit before tax in jurisdictions where we are not able to utilize the tax benefits 
in addition  the tax benefits associated with our tax holidays vary year to year based on the relative profitability in israel  singapore and switzerland 
during fiscal  our us and one of our foreign subsidiaries underwent and completed corporate income tax audits of years through and years through  respectively 
the foreign audit closed with no material adverse impact on our financial statements  and the irs completed its field work of the us subsidiaries with no income tax adjustments 
the report is under review b the irs national office and we expect to receive a final determination within the next year 
however  the payroll tax portion of the us audit remains open with regard to stock based compensation and related items 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax effect years ended february  january  change in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax effect of net income during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to estimating forfeitures in our adoption of sfas r 
years ended january  and january  net revenue years ended january  january  change in net revenue   net revenue consists primarily of product revenue from sales of our semiconductor devices  and to a much lesser extent  development revenue derived from development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a significant increase in volume shipments of our storage socs  which increased by million  printer semiconductor solutions and wireless products  which increased by million  cellular and handheld products  which increased by million  and hard disk drive controller products  which increased by million 
the increases in net revenue were primarily due to increased acceptance of our storage soc products by hard disk drive manufacturers  and increased market share gained in the pc desktop and consumer product markets with our storage soc products  volume shipments of our wireless products from new design wins 
the net revenue increase of printer semiconductor solutions was from initial shipments commencing in may with our acquisition of the printer semiconductor business from avago 
the increase in cellular and handheld products was from initial shipment of products in november from the acquisition of the communications and applications processor business from intel corporation 
the increase in hard disk drive controller products was a result of our initial product shipments in november after the acquisition of the hard disk drive controller business from qlogic 
net revenue derived from development contracts decreased in fiscal in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue compared to fiscal  and represented less than of net revenue for each year 
cost of goods sold years ended january  january  change in cost of goods sold   of net revenue gross margin cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and test of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  product warranty costs  royalties and compensation and associated costs relating to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel  including stock based compensation 
gross margin is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher inventory excess and obsolescence provision of million  increased stock based compensation costs of million  product costs associated with inventory that was acquired from our acquisitions  higher overhead costs of million and higher royalties of million 
the increase in excess and obsolescence provision was due to the mix and quantities of product on hand compared to forecasted demand for such products on hand 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was a result of our adoption of sfas r 
the increase in overhead costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the additional personnel  facility and related operating costs from our acquisitions during fiscal the increase in royalties in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to higher sales of products that integrated licensed technology 
our gross margins may fluctuate in future periods due to  among other things  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing of production ramps of new products  increased pricing pressures from our customers and competitors particularly in the consumer markets we are targeting  charges for obsolete or potentially excess inventory and changes in the costs charged by our manufacturing and test subcontractors 
research and development and other years ended january  january  change in research and development and other   of net revenue research and development and other expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  prototype costs  depreciation and amortization expense  patent investigation and filing fees  costs associated with contract development work and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional development personnel including personnel related to our acquisitions of the hard disk and tape drive controller business of qlogic in november  the semiconductor division of utstarcom in february  the printer asic division of avago in may and the communications and applications processor business of intel in november which together resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
in addition  research and development costs increased due to additional stock based compensation expenses of million as a result of our adoption of sfas r 
additionally  we incurred increased depreciation and amortization expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses  increased costs of million for prototype and related product tape out costs for new product initiatives  increased costs of million for tooling and engineering equipment expenses  increased costs of million for patent filing fees to protect newly developed intellectual property and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations

general and administrative expense also increased by million due to the use of various outside services 
amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other years ended january  january  change in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other of net revenue in fiscal  we made five acquisitions in which we acquired intangible assets which are being amortized over their estimate economic lives of one to eight years 
the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal compared to fiscal is partially offset by the absence of amortization of acquired intangible assets from historical acquisitions  which were fully amortized at the end of fiscal acquired in process research and development years ended january  january  change in acquired in process research and development   of net revenue in connection with the acquisition of the communications and application processor business of intel corporation on november   we purchased in process research and development iprd of approximately million 
the amounts allocated to iprd were determined based on our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired using valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were charged to expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal the projects that qualify for iprd had not reached technical feasibility and no future use existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 amounts assigned to iprd meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
the value assigned to in process research and technology was determined by considering the importance of products under development to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the fair values of iprd were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect additional risks related to the product s development and success as well as the product s stage of completion 
discount rates of to were used for valuing the iprd 
at the time of the acquisition  there were three significant projects in process that were approximately complete with estimated aggregate costs to complete of million 
the projects were completed during fiscal in connection with the acquisition of the hard disk and tape drive controller business of qlogic corporation on november   we purchased iprd valued at million 
the estimates used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results

provision for income taxes years ended january  january  change in provision for income taxes   of net revenue our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in fiscal and effective rates were primarily due to non tax deductible expenses  mainly stock based compensation  acquisition related expenses  and charges related to asset impairment resulting in a lower profit before tax in jurisdictions where we are unable to utilize tax benefits 
for fiscal and  the increases of and  respectively  was directly related to nondeductible officer compensation  penalties and interest expense 
during fiscal  our german and israel subsidiaries underwent and completed corporate tax audits of years through and years through  respectively 
during fiscal  the internal revenue service irs completed an income tax audit for the fiscal years ended february   february  and january  of our us consolidated return 
the audits closed with no material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
since the close of fiscal the irs has commenced an audit of the us consolidated returns for the fiscal years  and the irs has focused on stock based compensation and related items 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax effect years ended january  january  change in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax effect of net income during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to estimating forfeitures in our adoption of sfas r 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity as of february  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities  cash generated by operations and cash assumed in acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the cash inflows from operations in fiscal were primarily due to changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and other  million of depreciation and amortization expense and million of stock based compensation 
offsetting positive non cash charges was million of fair market value adjustments to intel inventory sold 
significant working capital changes contributing to positive cash flows in fiscal included a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to the utilization of prepaid foundry capacity and prepaid wafers 
also contributing to positive cash flow was an increase in deferred income due to the increased levels of inventory at distributors due to the increase in revenue 
significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flows in fiscal included an increase inventories of million to support increased revenue levels and from purchases of inventory under the supply agreement for which we plan to sell over periods in excess of one year 
the number of days in inventory has increased at the end of fiscal to days from days at the end of fiscal due to the higher comparable inventory balance at the end of each respective fiscal year 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the cash inflows from operations in fiscal were primarily the result of our generation of income during the period and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and other  million of depreciation and amortization expense  million of stock based compensation and million of acquired in process research and development 
significant working capital changes contributing to positive cash flows in fiscal included an increase of million in accounts payable resulting primarily from amounts due to our suppliers relating to increased inventory purchases during fiscal as well as higher overall spending activity related to our expanding operations  an increase of million in accrued employee compensation resulting from the increase in number of employees and related benefit accruals  an increase of million in income tax payable resulting from taxable income for fiscal and an increase of million in deferred income resulting from an increase in the number of distributors as well as increased shipments of product to our distributors 
significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flows in fiscal included an increase in prepaid and other assets of million due primarily to million in payments in connection with a capacity reservation agreement with a foundry and a million receivable from a foundry for reimbursements under a capacity reservation agreement 
also contributing to working capital changes offsetting positive cash flow in the fiscal was an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily due to higher net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal accounts receivable increased and the days sales outstanding  or dso  metric  which is calculated on a quarterly basis  increased to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal many of our larger customers have regularly scheduled payment dates with some of the dates falling immediately before or after our fiscal year end 
as a result  our accounts receivable balance and dso may fluctuate depending on the timing of large payments by our customers 
accrued liabilities and other also increased by million in fiscal due to higher accruals for legal fees  royalties  interest expense and an accrual for contingent acquisition payment 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for fiscal the cash inflows from operations in fiscal were primarily the result of our generation of income during the period and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and other  million of depreciation and amortization expense and million of amortization of stock based compensation

significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flows in fiscal included an increase in prepaid and other assets of million due primarily to million in payments in connection with a capacity reservation agreement with a foundry  a million security deposit for long term assets under construction  and a million receivable from a foundry for reimbursements under a capacity reservation agreement 
also contributing to working capital changes offsetting positive cash flow in fiscal was an increase in inventory of million  primarily a result of increased wafer starts to meet forecasted demand 
as a result of the increase in inventory  the number of days in inventory  which is calculated on a quarterly basis  increased to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal in addition  accounts receivable increased million primarily due to higher net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal although accounts receivable has increased  the days sales outstanding  or dso  metric  which is calculated on a quarterly basis  decreased to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal many of our larger customers have regularly scheduled payment dates with some of the dates falling immediately before or after our fiscal year end 
as a result  our accounts receivable balance and dso may fluctuate depending on the timing of large payments by our customers 
due to the nature of our business  we experience working capital needs for accounts receivable and inventory 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis with net thirty to sixty day payment terms 
if our sales levels were to increase as they have in prior fiscal years  it is likely that our levels of accounts receivable would also increase 
our levels of accounts receivable would also increase if customers delayed their payments or if we offered extended payment terms to our customers 
additionally  in order to maintain an adequate supply of product for our customers  we must carry a certain level of inventory 
our inventory level may vary based primarily upon orders received from our customers and our forecast of demand for these products  as well as the initial production ramp for significant design wins 
other considerations in determining inventory levels may include the product life cycle stage of our products  foundry lead times and available capacity and competitive situations in the marketplace 
these considerations are balanced against risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
our minimum purchase commitments to intel may also contribute to higher inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal and net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million partially offset by sales and maturities of investments of million

contractual obligations and commitments in connection with the acquisition of the intel s communications and application processor business icap business  we entered into a product supply agreement with intel 
we have met the contractual obligations under the original supply agreement 
although we have transitioned certain products to our fabrication partners  we anticipate that we will continue to source certain legacy application processor cellular and handset inventory from intel 
under terms of an amendment to the supply agreement  we have committed to purchase a minimum number of wafers through december as of february   we recorded million in prepaid assets for prepayment of wafers and had non cancellable purchase orders outstanding of million 
under our manufacturing relationships with all other foundries  cancellation of all outstanding purchase orders are allowed but require repayment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation 
as of february   these foundries had incurred approximately million of manufacturing expenses on our outstanding purchase orders 
on february  and as amended on march   we entered into an agreement with a foundry to reserve and secure foundry fabrication capacity for a fixed number of wafers at agreed upon prices for a period of five and a half years beginning on october  in return  we agreed to pay the foundry million over a period of eighteen months 
the amendment extends the term of the agreement and the agreed upon pricing terms until december  as of february   payments totaling million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets have been made and approximately million of the prepayment has been utilized as of february  at february   there are no outstanding commitments under the agreement 
as of february   we had approximately million of other outstanding non cancelable purchase orders for capital purchase obligations 
as a result of our facility move in february  we obtained a sublease on one of our facilities that had a non cancellable lease 
actual sublease income approximated the estimated sublease income  but is less than our actual lease commitment  resulting in future negative cash flow over the remaining term of the sublease of approximately million as of february  at february   cash payments of million  net of sublease income had been made in connection with this charge 
approximately million was accrued for this facilities consolidation charge as of february  of which million is current and million is long term  payable through in may  we completed the acquisition of the printer semiconductor business of avago 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we paid million in exchange for certain assets and intellectual property of avago and were committed to two additional contingent payments in cash of million and million upon the achievement of certain levels of revenue 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded contingent consideration and additional goodwill for the first contingent payment of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded the second contingent payment of million based on the achievement of certain levels of revenue during fiscal we currently intend to fund our short and long term capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as well as cash generated by operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital requirements  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
however  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the timing and extent of research and development projects  costs of making improvements to facilities and increases in operating expenses  which are all subject to uncertainty 
to the extent that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
we may enter into additional acquisitions or other strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current shareholders 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
as of february   our investment portfolio included million of auction rate securities  which are primarily backed by student loans originated under the federal family education loan program  or ffelp  and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
in addition  all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
most of these auction rate securities were scheduled to reset subsequent to february  in march  our auction rate securities failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
in the near term  we will not be able to access these funds associated with the failed auctions until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as a result  we have classified million of the auction rate securities as long term investments as of february  this amount represents the entire balance of the auction rate securities as of february  and had not been sold by the company subsequent to the end of fiscal we believe that we have the ability to hold these securities for longer than a period of twelve months 
while the recent auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  or other business requirements 
we have determined that no other than temporary impairment losses existed as of february  as all holdings had successful auctions in the periods leading up to that date 
however  if the issuer of the auction rate securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the auction rate securities  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of february  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total contractual obligations operating leases     capital lease obligations    purchase commitments to foundries  capital purchase obligations  long term debt obligations   total contractual cash obligations    included in operating lease commitments are lease payments for computer aided software license agreements and airplane lease commitments 
in addition to the above commitments and contingencies  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin there is also a recorded liability for potential penalties and interest of million and million  respectively as of february  we are uncertain when these amounts may be settled 
accruals will continue to be made and reversals will also be made as statutes lapse 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of february   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
prospective capital needs we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from exercise of employee stock options will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next months 
additionally  we are named as defendants to several litigation actions and have received a wells notice from the sec 
an unfavorable outcome in such actions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  including potential impacts to certain covenants under our existing credit agreement 
in the event that we may need or desire to raise additional funds to prepay our term loan obligation or consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  we could raise such funds by electing to sell equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
our existing credit agreement however limits our ability to borrow additional funds 
certain covenants would have to be met 
because one of the eligibility requirements for use of a form s filing is that an issuer must have timely filed all reports required to be filed with the sec during the preceding twelve calendar months  we currently cannot register securities on form s and would be required register these securities using a form s registration statement  which can be more complex  time consuming and expensive 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
also variable rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities including money market funds  corporate debt securities  federal  state  county and municipal debt securities and auction rate securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of february  in thousands 
this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
expected fiscal year maturity date total fair value variable rate    average interest rate fixed rate    average interest rate as of february   our investment portfolio included million of auction rate securities  which are investments with contractual maturities generally between to years 
they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  preferred stock  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset every seven to days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by student loans originated under the federal family education loan program  or ffelp  and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
in addition  all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
most of these auction rate securities were scheduled to reset subsequent to february  as of february   million of our auction rate securities have failed auctions  and we expect that the remaining auction rate securities will fail  due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
in the event we need to access these funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as a result  we have classified million of the auction rate securities as long term investments as of february  this amount represents the balance of the auction rate securities as of february  that had not been sold by us subsequent to the end of fiscal we believe that we have the ability to hold these securities for longer than a period of twelve months 
we determined that no other than temporary impairment losses existed as of february  as all holdings had successful auctions 
however  if the issuer of the auction rate securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the auction rate securities  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of february  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our term debt bears interest at the higher of the lender s prime rate or per annum above the federal funds effective rate  as defined in the agreement  plus a margin 
in the case of eurodollar loans  amounts borrowed bear interest at a rate equal to the adjusted london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a margin 
such margins are subject to reductions or increases depending on our future credit rating if obtained 
we pay interest and principal amounts equal to of the aggregate principal amount of loans on a quarterly basis on the last business day of each march  june  september and december 
the interest rate as of february  was 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments  which totaled million at february   are included in other non current assets in the accompanying balance sheets and are accounted for under the cost method because our ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of these companies 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
foreign currency exchange risk 
substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses to date have been denominated in united states dollars  and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
occasionally  we will enter into short term forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures for purchases denominated in foreign currencies such as the singapore dollar and the new israeli shekel 
we do not enter into any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
