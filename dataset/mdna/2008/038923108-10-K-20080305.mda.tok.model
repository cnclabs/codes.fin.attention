item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation that was formed in june to invest in multi family and commercial real estate related bridge  junior participating interests in first mortgages  mezzanine loans  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we also invest in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size of our asset portfolio 
credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximizing the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
as the size of the portfolio increases  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income may be held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
unlike other subsidiaries of a reit  the income of a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes 
we recorded a million provision for income taxes related to the assets that are held in taxable reit subsidiaries for the year ended december  on july   acm  our manager  contributed million of structured finance assets  encumbered by million of borrowings in exchange for an equity interest in our operating partnership represented by  units of limited partnership interest and  warrants to acquire additional units of limited partnership interest 
in addition  certain employees of acm became our employees 
we are externally managed and advised by acm and pay acm a management fee in accordance with a management agreement 
acm originates  underwrites and services all structured finance assets on behalf of our operating partnership 
concurrently with acm s asset contribution  we consummated a private placement of million units  each consisting of five shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock  for per unit  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
gross proceeds from the private placement combined with the concurrent equity contribution by acm totaled approximately million in equity capital 
on april   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses 
on may   we issued and sold  additional shares of common stock  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount pursuant to the exercise of a 
table of contents portion of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters of our initial public offering 
additionally  as of december   we issued  shares of common stock from the exercise of warrants originally issued as a component of units on july   for proceeds of million 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily through interest received from making real estate related bridge  mezzanine and junior participation loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately   and of our total revenues in   and  respectively 
interest income is also derived from profits of equity participation interests 
in  and interest income from participation interests represented approximately   and of total revenues  respectively 
we also derive interest income from our investments in mortgage related securities 
interest on these investments represented less than of our total revenues in  and in addition  we derived operating revenue from income from swap derivative which represented income from interest rate swaps on junior subordinated notes relating to trust preferred securities 
in  income from swap derivative represented less than of our total revenues 
there was no such revenue in and additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan structuring and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented less than of our total revenues in  and income from equity affiliates and gain on sale of loans and real estate we derive income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are recorded under either the equity or cost method of accounting as appropriate 
we record our share of net income and losses from the underlying properties on a single line item in the consolidated income statements as income from equity affiliates 
in  and  income from equity affiliates totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we also may derive income from the gain on sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate for our own investment and  upon stabilization  dispose at an anticipated return and real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
no such income has been recorded to date 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
loans and investments statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas requires that at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  
table of contents available for sale  or trading depending on ability and intent 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value  while securities and investments held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
we do not have any trading securities at this time 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
loans are considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of collateral on an individual loan basis 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by selecting the most appropriate valuation methodology  or methodologies  among several generally available and accepted in the commercial real estate industry 
the determination of the most appropriate valuation methodology is based on the key characteristics of the collateral type 
these methodologies include the evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  and estimated sales value of the collateral computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for each loan is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
we established a million allowance for loan losses at december  related to two multifamily loans in our portfolio with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
at december   no impairment had been identified and no valuation allowance had been established 
repurchase obligations in certain circumstances  we have financed the purchase of investments from a counterparty through a repurchase agreement with that same counterparty 
we currently record these investments in the same manner as other investments financed with repurchase agreements  with the investment recorded as an asset and the related borrowing under the repurchase agreement as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
interest income earned on the investments and interest expense incurred on the repurchase obligations are reported separately on the consolidated income statement 
these transactions may not qualify as a purchase by us under fsp fas which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we would be required to present the net investment on our balance sheet as a derivative with the corresponding change in fair value of the derivative being recorded in the income statement 
the value of the derivative would reflect not only changes in the value of the underlying investment  but also changes in the value of the underlying credit provided by the counterparty 
see note summary of significant accounting policies recently issued accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
capitalized interest we capitalize interest in accordance with sfas no 
capitalization of interest costs in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method 
this statement amended sfas no 

table of contents capitalization of interest costs to include investments equity  loans and advances accounted for by the equity method as qualifying assets of the investor while the investee has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations  provided that the investee s activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets for its operations 
one of our joint ventures  which is accounted for using the equity method  has used funds to acquire qualifying assets for its planned principal operations 
during  the joint venture sold both of the acquired properties and we discontinued the capitalization of interest on its remaining investment in the joint venture as activities required under sfas no 
ceased to continue 
we capitalized million  million  and million of interest during the year ended december   and  respectively  relating to this investment 
revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and available for sale securities 
in many instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  and deferred interest upon maturity 
in some cases interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising at the loan purchase or origination 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or available for sale security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination regarding collectibility  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess cash flows being distributed and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
variable interest entities in december  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r as a revision to fin no 
 which requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary pb 
the pb is the party that absorbs a majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or a majority of the expected returns 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our loans and investments and investments in equity affiliates to determine whether they are vies 
this evaluation resulted in us determining that our bridge loans  junior participation loans  mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments and investments in equity affiliates were potential variable interests 
for each of these investments  we have evaluated the sufficiency of the fair value of the entities equity investments at risk to absorb losses  that as a group the holders of the equity investments at risk have a the direct or indirect ability through voting rights to make decisions about the entities significant activities  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity and their obligations are not protected directly or indirectly  c the right to receive the expected residual return of the entity and their rights are not capped  the voting rights of some of these investors are proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity  their rights to receive the expected returns of the equity  or both  and that substantially all of the entities activities do not involve or are not conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
as of december   we have identified loans and investments which were made to entities determined to be vies 
however  for the vies identified  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiaries and as such the vies should not be consolidated in our financial statements 
for all other investments  we have determined they are not vies 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
a summary of our identified vies is presented in note of our consolidated financial statements  which appear in financial statements and supplementary data 

table of contents derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with sfas no 
 the carrying values of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged liabilities are reflected at their fair value 
as of december  we have retained the services of chatham financial corporation  a statement on auditing standards no 
sas  service organizations compliant  third party financial services company to determine these fair values 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see interest rate risk in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  set forth in item a hereof 
recently issued accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial condition or results of operations  see note summary of significant accounting policies recently issued accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements  set forth in item hereof

restricted cash increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  restricted cash is kept on deposit with the trustees for our collateralized debt obligations cdos  and primarily represents proceeds from loan repayments which will be used to purchase replacement loans as collateral for the cdos 
the increase was primarily due to proceeds received near the end of the year from the full satisfaction of loans held in the cdo for which funds had not yet been reinvested into other appropriate investments 
we sold all of our mortgage related securities during the quarter ended march  these securities had a balance of million at december  and had been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months 
the securities recovered their fair value in conjunction with a change in interest rates at which time we sold the securities and recorded a gain of  these securities were pledged as collateral for borrowings under a repurchase agreement and the proceeds of the sale were utilized to repay the repurchase agreement 
during  we purchased  shares of common stock of cbre realty finance  inc  a commercial real estate specialty finance company  which had a fair value of million  at december  we also have a margin loan agreement with a financial institution related to the purchases of this security

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for further description of this transaction 
other assets increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to funding additional cash collateral for a portion of our interest rate swaps whose value has declined as a result of reductions in the libor rate  as well as an increase in the fair value of other interest rate swaps that hedge our exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between the three month libor and one month libor rates 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information relating to our derivatives 
deferred revenue totaled million at december  representing a deferred gain recognized on the transfer of control of the west rd street property of one of our equity affiliates 
the transaction was structured to provide a tax deferral for an estimated period of seven years 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for further description of this transaction 
other liabilities increased million from million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million unrealized loss on the fair value of our interest rate swaps  due to a reduction in libor rates  with a corresponding offset to other comprehensive loss 
the increase also included a million margin loan related to the purchase of investment securities  a million deferred gain on the sale of of the economic interest in the property of one of our investment in equity affiliates  and an increase in accrued interest expense for cdos due to the issuance of our third cdo at the end of on june   we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses

provision for loan losses totaled million for the year ended december  and there was no provision for loan losses for the year ended december  the provision recorded was based on our normal quarterly loan review at december   where it was determined that two multi family loans were impaired

management fee expense increased million  or  to million in from million in these amounts represent compensation in the form of base management fees and incentive compensation management fees as provided for in the management agreement with our manager 
the base management fee expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to increased stockholders equity directly attributable to greater undistributed profits and capital raised from the june public offering of our common stock over the same period in the incentive compensation management fee expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due in part to the recognition of million of interest income from profits and equity interests and million of income from equity affiliates during as compared to million of interest income from profits and equity interest and million of income from equity investments in income from equity affiliates income from equity affiliates increased million to million in from million for this increase was due to a million and million gain recognized on the sale of properties within one of our equity affiliates  and million of income from excess proceeds received from the sale and refinancing of certain properties in the portfolio of another of our investments in equity affiliates

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future loans and investments  fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders as well as other general business needs 
our primary sources of 
table of contents funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity offerings  debt facilities and cash flows from operations 
our equity sources consist of funds raised from our private equity offering in july  net proceeds from our initial public offering of our common stock in april  net proceeds from our public offering of our common stock in june and depending on market conditions  proceeds from capital market transactions including the future issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
our debt facilities include the issuance of floating rate notes resulting from our cdos  the issuance of junior subordinated notes to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred securities and borrowings under credit agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities include interest income from our loan and investment portfolio reduced by interest expense on our debt facilities  cash from equity participation interests  repayments of outstanding loans and investments and funds from junior loan participation arrangements 
we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term and long term liquidity needs 
our loans and investments are financed under existing credit facilities and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to renew our sources of financing on substantially similar terms or at all  it would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our significant capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements  including expected new lending and investment opportunities 
equity offerings our authorized capital provides for the issuance of up to million shares of common stock  par value per share  and million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
in march  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under the act with respect to an aggregate of million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants  that may be sold by us from time to time pursuant to rule of the act 
on april   the commission declared this shelf registration statement effective 
in june  we sold  shares of our common stock registered on the shelf registration statement in a public offering at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses 
we used the proceeds to pay down debt and finance our loan and investment portfolio 
the underwriters did not exercise their over allotment option for additional shares 
at december   we had million available under this shelf registration and  shares outstanding 
debt facilities we also maintain liquidity through two term credit agreements  one of which has a revolving credit component  three master repurchase agreements  one working capital facility  and one bridge loan warehousing credit agreement with five different financial institutions 
in addition  we have issued three collateralized debt obligations cdos and nine separate junior subordinated notes 
london inter bank offered rate  or libor  refers to one month libor unless specifically stated 
as of december   these facilities had an aggregate capacity of billion and borrowings were approximately billion

repurchase agreements repurchase obligation financings provide us with a revolving component to our debt structure 
repurchase agreements provide stand alone financing for certain assets and interim  or warehouse financing  for assets that we plan to contribute to our cdos 
at december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these facilities was million

cdos we completed three separate cdos since by issuing to third party investors  tranches of investment grade collateralized debt obligations through newly formed wholly owned subsidiaries the issuers 
the issuers hold assets  consisting primarily of real estate related assets and cash which serve as collateral for the cdos 
the assets pledged as collateral for the cdos were contributed from our existing portfolio of assets 
by contributing these real estate assets to the various cdos  these transactions resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to the corresponding cdo assets and created capacity in our existing credit facilities 
the issuers issued tranches of investment grade floating rate notes of approximately million  million and million for cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii  respectively 
cdo iii also has a million revolving note which was not drawn upon at the time of issuance 
the revolving note facility has a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn portion of the facility 
the tranches were issued with floating rate coupons based on three month libor plus pricing of 
proceeds from the sale of the investment grade tranches issued in cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii of million  million and million  respectively  were used to repay higher costing outstanding debt under our repurchase agreements and notes payable 
the cdos may be replenished with substitute collateral for loans that are repaid during the first four years for cdo i and the first five years for cdo ii and cdo iii  subject to certain customary provisions 
thereafter  the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid 
proceeds from the repayment of assets which serve as collateral for the cdos must be retained in its structure as restricted cash until such collateral can be replaced and therefore not available to fund current cash needs 
if such cash is not used to replenish collateral  it could have a negative impact on our anticipated returns 
proceeds from cdo i and cdo ii are distributed quarterly with approximately million and million  respectively  being paid to investors as a reduction of the cdo liability 
for accounting purposes  cdos are consolidated in our financial statements 
at december   the outstanding note balance under cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii was million  million and million  respectively 
the recent turmoil in the structured finance markets  in particular the sub prime residential loan market  has negatively impacted the credit markets generally  and  as a result  investor demand for commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations has been substantially curtailed 
in recent years  we have relied to a substantial extent on cdo financings to obtain match funded financing for our investments 
until the market for commercial real estate cdos recovers  we may be unable to utilize cdos to finance our investments and we may need to utilize less favorable sources of financing to finance our investments on a long term basis 
there can be no assurance as to when demand for commercial real estate cdos will return or the terms of such securities investors will demand or whether we will be able to issue cdos to finance our investments on terms beneficial to us

table of contents agreement  increased the committed amount of the facility to million and extended the maturity date to september the repurchase agreement facility bears interest at pricing over libor 
see repurchase agreements discussed above 
the working capital facility  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  term and revolving credit agreements  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay interest monthly  based on pricing over libor 
the amount of our pricing over these rates varies depending upon the structure of the loan or investment financed pursuant to the specific agreement 
the working capital facility  term and revolving credit agreements  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay down borrowings under these facilities pro rata as principal payments on our loans and investments are received 
in addition  if upon maturity of a loan or investment we decide to grant the borrower an extension option  the financial institutions have the option to extend the borrowings or request payment in full on the outstanding borrowings of the loan or investment extended 
the financial institutions also have the right to request immediate payment of any outstanding borrowings on any loan or investment that is at least days delinquent 
cash flow from operations we continually monitor our cash position to determine the best use of funds to both maximize our return on funds while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity 
historically  in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations has generally been used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
when making distributions  we have borrowed the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities 
to date  all distributions have been funded in this manner 
all funds borrowed to make distributions have been repaid by funds generated from operations 
however  in order to maintain adequate liquidity within our credit facilities for their primary purpose of funding our new loans and investments  we may begin to accumulate cash generated from operations to make the distributions 
restrictive covenants each of the credit facilities contains various financial covenants and restrictions  including minimum net worth and debt to equity ratios 
in addition to the financial terms and capacities described above  our credit facilities generally contain covenants that prohibit us from effecting a change in control  disposing of or encumbering assets being financed and restrict us from making any material amendment to our underwriting guidelines without approval of the lender 
if we violate these covenants in any of our credit facilities  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of these covenants may result in our being unable to borrow unused amounts under our credit facilities  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under these credit facilities

the base management fee is not calculated based on the manager s performance or the types of assets its selects for investment on our behalf  but it is affected by the performance of these assets because it is based on the value of our operating partnership s equity 
we incurred million and million in base management fees for services rendered in and  respectively 
incentive compensation 
pursuant to the management agreement  our manager is also entitled to receive incentive compensation in an amount equal to of the amount by which a our operating partnership s funds from operations per operating partnership unit  adjusted for certain gains and losses  exceeds 
table of contents b the product of x the greater of per annum or the ten year us treasury rate plus  and y the weighted average of i  ii the offering price per share of our common stock including any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of warrants or options in any subsequent offerings adjusted for any prior capital dividends or distributions  and iii the issue price per operating partnership unit for subsequent contributions to our operating partnership  multiplied by the weighted average of our operating partnership s outstanding operating partnership units 
in  our manager earned a total of million of incentive compensation which includes million recorded as management fee expense and million recorded as prepaid management fees related to the incentive management fee on the deferred gain recognized on the transfer of control of the west rd street property of one of our equity affiliates 
our manager has elected to receive these payments in the form of  shares of common stock with the remainder paid in cash totaling million 
in  our manager earned a total of million of incentive compensation and elected to receive it partially in cash totaling million and partially in  shares of common stock 
we pay the annual incentive compensation in four installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive compensation are subject to recalculation and potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year 
subject to the ownership limitations in our charter  at least of this incentive compensation is payable to our manager in shares of our common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last days of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive compensation is being paid 
the incentive compensation is accrued as it is earned 
in accordance with issue b of eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the expense incurred for incentive compensation paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive compensation paid to our manager in the form of common stock in accordance with issue a of eitf which discusses how to measure at the measurement date when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  the expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the annual incentive compensation is determined 
in the event that the annual incentive compensation calculated as of the measurement date is less than the four quarterly installments of the annual incentive compensation paid in advance  our manager will refund the amount of such overpayment in cash and we would record a negative incentive compensation expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined

if  without cause  we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement for any other reason  including a change of control of us  we are required to pay a termination fee equal to two times the base management fee and incentive compensation paid for the month period preceding the termination 
inflation in and  inflation and changing prices did not have a material effect on our net income and revenue 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
however  the significant decline in interest rates during the latter part of 
table of contents triggered libor floors on certain of our variable rate interest earning assets 
this resulted in an increase in interest rate spreads as the rates we pay on variable rate interest bearing liabilities declined at a greater pace than the rates we earned on our variable rate interest earning assets 
additionally  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be affected

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk and interest rate risk 
market conditions we are subject to market changes in the debt and secondary mortgage markets 
these markets are currently experiencing disruptions  which could have a short term adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased risk adjusted premiums 
these conditions may increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of debt market disruptions by obtaining adequate debt facilities from a variety of financing sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in these efforts  that such debt facilities will be adequate or that the cost of such debt facilities will be at similar terms 
the secondary mortgage markets are also currently experiencing disruptions resulting from reduced investor demand for collateralized debt obligations and increased investor yield requirements for these obligations 
in light of these conditions  we currently expect to finance our loan and investment portfolio with our current capital and debt facilities 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  events such as natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes  acts of war and or terrorism such as the events of september  and others that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investment  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property s debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
many of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
based on the loans and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would decrease our 
table of contents annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to various interest rate floors that are in effect at a rate that is above a increase in libor which would limit the effect of a increase  and increased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to various interest rate floors which limit the effect of a decrease on interest income and decreased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively converted a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a decrease 
as of december   a increase in libor would have increased our annual net income and cash flows in the subsequent twelve months by approximately million 
this is primarily due to our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
as of december   a decrease in libor would have decreased our annual net income and cash flows in the subsequent twelve months by approximately million 
this is primarily due to our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a decrease  partially offset by loans currently subject to interest rate floors and  therefore  not be subject to the full downward interest rate adjustment 
in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
during the quarter ended march   we sold our entire securities available for sale portfolio 
these securities which had been designated as held for sale were financed with a repurchase agreement  and the proceeds of the sale were utilized to repay the repurchase agreement 
in connection with our cdos described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the investor s return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
as of december  and  we had ten of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have combined notional values of billion and billion  respectively 
the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   and december   if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
in connection with the issuance of variable rate junior subordinate notes during  and  we entered into various interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps have total notional values of million and million  respectively  as of december  and december  the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december  and december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had twenty seven interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have a combined notional value of million 
as of december  we had eighteen interest rate swap agreements outstanding with combined notional values of million to hedge current and outstanding libor 
table of contents based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december  and december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes
