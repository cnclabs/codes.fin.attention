item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data on a consolidated basis in thousands years ended december  sales    cost of sales    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and engineering expenses   operating income    interest expense  interest income loss on extinguishment of debt other expense income income from continuing operations before income taxes  provision for income taxes    income from continuing operations    discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  net income    the following table sets forth the percent of sales by segment years ended december  imaging systems group surveillance systems group overview we are a leading designer and manufacturer of precision optical solutions for defense  aerospace  homeland security and high performance commercial applications 
these sophisticated solutions are typically found in applications that demand the finest optical surfaces  highest accuracy and tightest motion control tolerances 
application examples include weapon systems  long range surveillance cameras and highly precise imaging telescopes 
we typically sell our products to government institutions such as the us border patrol  army  navy  air force  and coast guard  or to large defense contractors for integration into larger platforms 
our products are sold to both end user communities and oems in a variety of markets that demand the precision and performance that our products and capabilities provide 
in december  we re aligned our company around our core market segments and announced our reorganization into two business units  the surveillance system group and the imaging systems group 
surveillance systems group the surveillance systems group designs  manufactures and sells highly precise camera systems for deployment on ground marine  and aerial vehicles 
the products are typically used in surveillance  reconnaissance  tracking and targeting applications 
our products can be grouped into two primary areas non stabilized camera systems and gyrostabilized camera systems 
non stabilized camera systems are often deployed as fixed mounts on poles or masts 
typical applications for non stabilized camera systems include border surveillance  port threat detection and perimeter security 
the survelliance systems group has design and manufacturing facilities in nashua  new hampshire and grass valley  california 
imaging systems group the imaging systems group designs  manufactures and sells optical and motion control subsystems and components for deployment in larger  integrated systems 
products in the imaging systems group include visible and infrared lenses  scanning systems  laser positioners  long range telescopes  stabilized sensor positioning systems  precision motion control components  and imaging optics 
the imaging systems group has design and manufacturing facilities in nashua  new hampshire  san diego  california  cullman  alabama  and rochester hills  michigan 
disposition of business on november   we sold our distributed products business for million in cash 
axsys recognized a million gain on the sale of the business net of million in income tax expense 
in addition  million of legal  audit and other transaction related costs were incurred in connection with the sale 
we believe that the sale of this non strategic business has allowed us to focus on our increasingly prominent and faster growing optics business 
in addition  a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down our outstanding debt  which we believe will give us more flexibility in pursuing strategic acquisitions in our core business 
acquisitions on april   axsys acquired cineflex  llc cineflex  a privately held manufacturer of high precision gyro stabilized aerial camera systems  for million in cash 
additional incremental cash payments of up to million are possible if certain revenue targets are exceeded as part of a three year earn out agreement 
in addition  a second contingent payment of up to of all revenues recognized from multi year orders in backlog at the end of the earn out period is possible if revenues in the fourth year from the acquisition date exceed million 
in connection with the acquisition we incurred million of legal  audit and other acquisition related costs 
cineflex is a technology leader in the design and manufacture of highly stable  multi sensor  multi axis surveillance platforms serving customers in federal and local government and in the motion picture and electronic news gathering industries 
at the time of acquisition  cineflex employed approximately people at its grass valley  california facility 
in connection with the acquisition of cineflex  we amended our credit agreement to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to may  and increased the commitment amount from million to million 
on april   we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase price 
as of december   we have repaid in full all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility with a combination of cash on hand and a portion from the net proceeds of the sale of our distributed products business 
on may   we acquired all of the stock of diop  a manufacturer of high end thermal camera systems and lenses  for million in cash plus million of legal  audit and other acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition 
the acquisition of diop brought us new  high value technologies  leveraged our existing infrared and motion control technologies and provided us with a new base of customers 
further  the combination of diop and axsys positioned us as a leading independent infrared lens manufacturer 
at the time of the acquisition  diop employed approximately people at its salem  new hampshire headquarters 
in connection with the acquisition of diop  on may   we also entered into a million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility consisted of a five year term loan a in the amount of million  a two year term loan b in the amount of million and a three year revolving line of credit in the maximum amount of million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided a portion of the consideration used to acquire diop 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  we used a portion of the net proceeds from a public stock offering to repay all of the amounts outstanding under the term loan b 
in addition to repaying term loan b  we also repaid in full the amount outstanding under the term loan a with a portion of the net proceeds of the stock offering 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  however  million of the revolving credit facility was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
facilities during  we sold our buildings located in nashua  new hampshire for million and cullman  alabama for million 
concurrent with the sales  we entered into year operating leases 
each lease is renewable at our option for an additional five years 
as part of the sale and leaseback  we have no continuing involvement aside from the lease agreement 
the million difference between the sales proceeds received net of thousand closing costs and the book value of assets sold was deferred and is being amortized over the life of the initial lease terms 
on april   we purchased a  square foot building and acres of land in nashua  new hampshire for million 
this facility serves as a consolidated manufacturing facility that supports both of our reporting segments 
the relocation and the closure of the two existing facilities was completed in the fourth quarter of during  total pre tax costs associated with the relocation and facilities closures were approximately million  with an additional million of capital expenditures 
these costs included equipment relocation  employee training and facility improvements 
in addition  we recognized a million in expense for the cancellation of the existing salem facility lease 
share based compensation expense effective january   we were required to record the expense of share based payment transactions pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
under the modified prospective method  we were not required to restate the prior year financial statements or include in the current year any expenses related to stock option grants vested as of december  during the first quarter of  we reviewed our equity compensation program to determine the most appropriate equity award vehicles based on our objectives and new accounting and regulatory rules 
stock ownership guidelines  award types and award amounts were also reviewed to ensure market competitiveness 
as a result of this review  we began granting a mix of restricted stock and stock options to all eligible employees and directors 
prior to january   only stock option awards were granted 
the impact of sfas r on our operations is discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
public stock offering on september   we issued and sold  shares of common stock at the public offering price of per share 
gross proceeds from the stock offering were million 
after underwriting discounts and commissions  we received million 
we utilized million to repay all of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  including accrued interest and fees  and million to pay expenses related to the stock offering  and we used the remaining million for working capital and general corporate purposes 
significant customers bae systems  an aerospace and defense systems suppliers  represented of our net sales in  of our net sales in and of our net sales in raytheon company  an aerospace and defense systems supplier  represented of our net sales in and of our net sales in while both bae and raytheon  who are prime contractors with the us government  do constitute a significant portion of our business  we do not currently believe that these are at risk businesses 
backlog and orders axsys received new orders of million in  ending the year with record backlog of million  of which will be shipped beyond months 
our backlog increased by million  or  compared to our ending backlog of million as of december  results of segment operations the following tables and discussion set forth selected financial information from continuing operations on a segment basis for the years ended december   and imaging systems group table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales    gross profit    operating income    fiscal results versus fiscal results sales in the imaging systems group increased for the year ended december  compared to the increase in sales was primarily due to our growing participation in large scale programs such as the us army s thermal weapons sight program 
in addition  we are continuing to experience additional revenue growth from our involvement in the development of next generation targeting  navigation and surveillance systems used in the defense  space and homeland security markets 
we believe that our participation in these growing worldwide markets will continue to increase and in turn drive our revenue growth within the imaging systems group 
gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  declined when compared to the infrared lens business  which was acquired in recent years  continues to develop from its roots as a specialty design shop into a large scale manufacturer 
this transformation has enabled us to participate in large military programs  which are competitive in nature and tend to carry lower margins than other programs within this reporting segment 
operating income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the imaging systems group was able to leverage its operating expenses and increase its operating margins year over year even with the gross margin pressures we experienced 
fiscal results versus fiscal results sales in the imaging systems group increased for the year ended december  compared to the growth in sales was primarily due to increased demand for our infrared product lines 
some of the increase was also due to a full year of revenues in from diop  which was acquired in may of in addition  we had organic growth in large military programs such as the stryker assault vehicle during increasing sales of our targeting and navigation products used within the aerospace and defense markets also contributed to overall revenue growth in gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  remained comparable to the higher sales volume during did not generate incremental margin as the recently acquired infrared business began its transformation into a large scale manufacturing facility and secured participation on a number of large military programs 
in addition  increasing germanium costs impacted our profitability on firm fixed price contracts 
operating income increased million for the year ended december  compared to largely as a result of revenue growth and our ability to hold operating expenses relatively flat year over year 
surveillance systems group table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales    gross profit    operating income    fiscal results versus fiscal results sales in the surveillance systems group increased for the year ended december  compared to the increase in sales was in part due to the addition of a product line related to our acquisition of cineflex  the gyrostabilized camera system 
gyrostabilized sales accounted for approximately of the total sales increase in the surveillance group during  while simultaneously increasing our participation within a growing commercial market 
increased revenues in were also attributable to strong organic growth among our infrared camera product lines 
with the increasing threat of terrorism and the need for stronger border control around the world  the demand for our cameras will continue to grow 
gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  increased when compared to our gyrostabilized camera system product lines are currently used exclusively in commercial applications  which generally carry higher margins than our military product lines 
operating income increased million for the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of higher sales volume and gross margin improvements  offset partially by additional operating expenses of million associated with the operation of cineflex  which was acquired in april of fiscal results versus fiscal results sales in the surveillance systems group increased for the year ended december  compared to the growth in sales was primarily due to a full year of revenues in from the diop acquisition completed in our increased participation in programs involving border surveillance  port threat detection and perimeter security also contributed to the increased revenues in gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  decreased by when compared to this decrease was due to higher material costs associated with the lenses in our infrared camera products and an overall increase in facility and overhead costs necessary to support the growing business 
operating income increased million for the year ended december  compared to operating income benefited from revenue growth  which was partially offset by increased investment in research and development and sales and marketing efforts in order to foster future growth opportunities 
operating expenses table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses  research  development and engineering expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  spending during increased by when compared to spending in the increase in spending was primarily due to the acquisition of cineflex in april  which added approximately million of operating expense in we also increased spending over a number of expense categories such as compensation  commissions and marketing to support the overall growth of the business 
sg a spending during was higher than spending during several factors contributed to the increases 
the adoption of sfas r added million of additional compensation expense in additional costs associated with having diop for a full year compared to eight months in were estimated to be million 
we incurred million of move related expenses associated with the consolidation of two manufacturing facilities and an additional million across several expense categories associated with the general growth of the business 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses in increased by million and million compared to and  respectively 
we continue to enhance existing products and develop new products to ensure competitiveness in the imaging market place 
other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense of million in was due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which was used to fund a portion of the cineflex acquisition 
interest expense declined to thousand in compared to primarily due to lower overall borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
interest expense of million in was due to million in term loans incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of diop 
interest income 
interest income was million in the year ended december  and and million in interest income was primarily composed of income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase from was primarily due to overall higher interest rates on higher than average cash on hand 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in conjunction with our prepayment of the principal and accrued interest on the million term loan a and the million term loan b during  we incurred a charge of million for the write off of loan origination fees and for the early termination of the related interest rate swap agreement 
other income and expense  net 
net other expense in was million compared to net other income of thousand in and thousand in other income and expense were composed primarily of the gains and losses incurred as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses and the disposal of capital equipment

net income 
we had net income of million  or per diluted share  in  net income of million  or per diluted share  in and net income of million  or per diluted share  in in addition  we issued  shares of common stock through a public stock offering in september  which impacted earnings per share 
liquidity and capital resources axsys strategy to enhance stockholder value is dependent on our ability to take advantage of both internal and external business opportunities as they arise 
maximizing the utilization of our cash resources is crucial to the successful execution of our strategy 
during  we took several key steps in support of our strategy 
on april   we amended our credit agreement to increase our revolving line of credit from million to million 
during the second quarter of  we also completed the sale leaseback of our nashua  new hampshire and cullman  alabama facilities  which generated net proceeds of million 
on november   we sold our distributed products business  which generated million in cash 
in addition  we have also continued to focus on profitability and working capital management to increase cash flow from operations 
we have already begun to invest in new growth opportunities  including the acquisition of cineflex and increased spending on research and development and capital equipment that is critical to increased production capacity 
on april   in connection with the acquisition of cineflex  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase price 
we have repaid the entire million of the borrowings  leaving no borrowings outstanding at december  while the borrowings were outstanding  we paid a weighted average interest rate of on these borrowings 
our revolving credit facility remains available through may  subject to optional prepayment in accordance with its terms 
we may elect to have any borrowing under the revolving credit facility bear interest either at the bank s prime rate or the libor rate plus a margin of to basis points  depending on our consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio 
we have the option of selecting the month  month  month or month libor rate 
up to million of the revolving credit facility may be utilized to issue letters of credit 
as of december   million of the revolving credit facility was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including covenants regarding minimum ebitda  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants required under our credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility were secured by a lien on all our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  as well as a pledge of the stcok of our subsidiaries 
with our existing cash balance  anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  management believes that axsys has sufficient liquidity to finance its operations  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  including at least the next twelve months

in addition  net income includes income from our discontinued operations  net of tax  of million  which included a net gain on the sale of our distributed products business of million 
in  we utilized million of cash to fund changes in our operating assets and liabilities from continuing operations 
this increase was driven by the utilization of million of cash to fund an increase in our inventories  which was needed to support growth from our new gimbal product line and long lead time orders within our imaging systems group 
in addition  we utilized million to fund a decrease in accrued liabilities related to a reduction in excess billings over costs associated with some projects accounted for under the percentage of completion method partically offset by additional compensation related expenses 
we also used million of cash to fund changes in other assets and other liabilities primarily due to purchase of demonstration equipment used in our surveillance system group 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenues caused by growth within our surveillance systems group 
in addition  a million decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of improved collection efforts and cash in advance of sales within the surveillance systems group

we also utilized million of cash to fund an increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of unbilled receivables generated by service contracts and excess of cost over billings on percentage of completion accounting 
additional cash outflows of million were primarily for the utilization of loss contract reserves  legal and consulting costs associated with environmental activities and the reduction of deferred income as we completed some long lead time orders 
during  cash provided by discontinued operations totaled million 
this consists of cash generated from our distributed products business in and cash used for environmental clean up activities at various formerly owned sites 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in during  we utilized million of cash to purchase the assets of cineflex 
we received million in proceeds from the sale of the manufacturing facilities in nashua  new hampshire and cullman  alabama as part of sale leaseback transactions

off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any special purpose entities 
contracts and commitments we have entered into certain contractual obligations that will result in material cash outlays over the next several years 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for capital leases  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases      purchase obligations   other long term obligations  total      as of december   we had operating lease commitments for all of our facilities 
in addition  our operating lease commitments included leases on some office equipment 
as of december   we had various purchase obligations  which include uninvoiced inventory receipts  capital equipment commitments  long distance phone service and other commitments 
incorporated in other long term obligations are commitments related to environmental remediation plans and employee benefit obligations 
we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at three sites  which include one site that is in the final stage of monitoring 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
as of december   we determined that it was probable that we would incur approximately million of remediation and monitoring costs  of which million is included in current liabilities and million is in other long term liabilities 
as of december   we were contingently liable for million under outstanding letters of credit 
we have issued letters of credit for certain business transactions including insurance programs and a letter of credit in lieu of escrow account on our recently divested distributed products business

the plan is an unfunded plan with an annual payout of approximately million 
during  we sold our buildings located in nashua  new hampshire and cullman  alabama 
concurrent with the sale  we entered into year operating leases with the buyer 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory allowances  contingencies  bad debts  warranties  environmental remediation efforts and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventory valuation and the adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts  long term loss contract reserves and environmental contingencies 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture or distribute products that are sold to end users  equipment integrators and oems 
some of our contracts are subject to customer acceptance and generally the customer will inspect and accept the product at our facility prior to shipment 
generally  legal title passes to the customer upon shipment 
however  occasionally product is shipped fob destination 
when the product is shipped fob destination  revenues are not recognized until the customer receives the product 
our policy is to recognize revenues when a product is either shipped to or received by the customer based on the terms of the specific sale 
however  certain long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
revenues and estimated gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor  materials and overhead 
these contracts require judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
contract changes are included when the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we may receive progress payments that exceed costs incurred on these long term contracts 
such advances are recognized as billings in excess of costs and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income results from advance payments from our customers on both military and commercial contracts as well as advance billings to our customers for the cost of beryllium  known as material only billings 
these advance payments and material only billings are deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue only when the associated finished product is shipped 
generally  our customer contracts are completed within one year of receiving the order 
however  occasionally  longer lead time orders are received and we monitor these contracts periodically to determine if our actual costs are comparable to our cost estimates used at the time of order acceptance 
if we determine that our actual costs are significantly exceeding our original estimates  we will record a loss contract reserve 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically review the aging of our accounts receivable over days to identify potentially uncollectible accounts and establish an allowance based on experience and discussion with customers 
historically  our estimated allowance has approximated actual write offs 
however  actual write offs could differ from our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change for example  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
accounts receivable are written off only when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on current requirements and historical usage 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  some of our markets are characterized by rapid technological change or frequent new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine our inventory to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize those costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
historically  our estimate of inventory reserves has approximated actual results 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the cost of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as part of the purchase price allocation for our acquired businesses  identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights  or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
the values assigned to acquired identifiable intangible assets are determined  as of the date of acquisition  based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after tax cash flows from those assets over their lives  including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales  less a cost of capital charge  all of which is discounted to present value 
the value assigned to goodwill equals the amount of the purchase price of the business acquired in excess of the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable acquired assets  both tangible and intangible  less liabilities assumed 
we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas requires that goodwill be tested  at a minimum  annually for each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow valuation approach  which is dependent on estimates for future operating results  working capital changes  and capital expenditures  as well as expected growth rates for cash flows and long term interest rates 
a decline in future operating results or a change in our discount rate in the future could result in a change in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and result in an impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental contingencies 
we are currently involved in two environmental remediation projects and one site that is in the final stage of monitoring all of which relates to discontinued operations 
we accrue for environmental contingencies when responsibility for cleanup is determined and costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when costs are not probable and cannot be reasonably estimated  no accrual is made 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside environmental consultants handling these matters and are based upon an analysis of the anticipated remediation plans 
we do not anticipate these projects will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
although our estimates to date have proven to be accurate  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is established based on an analysis of historical data and is reviewed by management on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity and frequency of claims  medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results from operations could be impacted 
share based compensation 
we elected to use a black scholes merton option pricing model to value stock options that were granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the model includes various assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions are based on historical information regarding grants  exercises and cancellations 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of axsys 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense could have varied 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate the income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not more than likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased during any period  we include this amount as an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recognized against net deferred assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of the taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our results of operations 
axsys recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adopted fin on january  and use this guidance to record these liabilities refer to note for additional information 
axsys adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal sfas provides a common fair value hierarchy for companies to follow in determining fair value measurements in the preparation of financial statements and expands disclosure requirements relating to how fair value measurements were developed 
sfas clarifies the principal that fair value should be based on the assumptions that the marketplace would use when pricing an asset or liability  rather than company specific data 
the company is currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on its results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal the company is currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  and sfas no 
 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
these new standards will significantly change the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling or minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
in comparison to current practice in us generally accepted accounting principles  the most significant changes to business combination accounting pursuant to sfas r include requirements to recognize  with certain exceptions  percent of the fair values of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity 
measure acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination at fair value on the acquisition date 
recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings 
with certain exceptions  recognize preacquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values 
capitalize in process research and development assets acquired 
expense  as incurred  acquisition related transaction costs 
capitalize acquisition related restructuring costs only if the criteria in sfas are met as of the acquisition date 
recognize changes that result from a business combination transaction in an acquirer s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals as adjustments to income tax expense 
the premise of sfas is based on the economic entity concept of consolidated financial statements 
under the economic entity concept  all residual economic interest holders in an entity have an equity interest in the consolidated entity  even if the residual interest is relative to only a portion of the entity ie  a residual interest in a subsidiary 
therefore  sfas requires that a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary be displayed in the consolidated statement of financial position as a separate component of equity because the noncontrolling interests meet the definition of equity of the consolidated entity 
sfas r is required to be adopted concurrently with sfas and is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
the company is currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on its results of operations and financial position
