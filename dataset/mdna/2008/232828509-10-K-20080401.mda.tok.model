item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the discussion under selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents overview cytrx corporation we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing human therapeutic products based primarily upon our small molecule molecular chaperone amplification technology 
molecular chaperone proteins occur normally in human cells and are key components of the body s defenses against potentially toxic mis folded cellular proteins 
since damaged toxic proteins called aggregates are thought to play a role in many diseases  we believe that amplification of molecular chaperone proteins could have therapeutic efficacy for a broad range of indications 
currently  we are using our chaperone amplification technology to develop treatments for neurodegenerative disorders and diabetic complications 
we have relied primarily upon selling equity securities and upon proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants and  to a much lesser extent  upon payments from our strategic partners and licensees  to generate funds needed to finance our business and operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  including million held by rxi 
we believe that cytrx s current resources will be sufficient to support our currently planned level of operations into the second half of this estimate is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million  including approximately million for our clinical program for arimoclomol for als and related studies  approximately million for our planned phase ii clinical trial of arimoclomol in stroke patients and phase ii clinical trial of iroxanadine for diabetic ulcers  approximately million for equipping and operating our research laboratory in san diego  california  and approximately million for other general and administrative expenses 
management believes that rxi s current resources will be sufficient to support its currently planned level of operations into the second quarter of as described in the risk factor above  these projected expenditures are based upon numerous assumptions and subject to many uncertainties  and our actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections 
we have no significant revenue  and we expect to have no significant revenue and to continue to incur significant losses over the next several years 
our net losses may increase from current levels primarily due to expenses related to our ongoing and planned clinical trials  research and development programs  possible technology acquisitions  and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate  therefore  that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our separation from rxi pharmaceuticals corporation rxi pharmaceuticals corporation  or rxi  was founded in april by us and four researchers in the field of rnai  including dr 
craig mello  recipient of the nobel prize for medicine for his co discovery of rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring mechanism for the regulation of gene expression that has the potential to selectively inhibit the activity of any human gene 
as evidenced by kim and rossi s review published in march in nature reviews genetics  it is believed that this inhibition may potentially treat human diseases by silencing genes that lead to disease 
in january  we transferred to rxi substantially all of our rnai related technologies and assets  and rxi began operating on a stand alone basis for the purpose of accelerating the discovery of rnai therapeutics previously sponsored by us 
rxi s initial focus is on developing rnai based product candidates for treating neurological and metabolic disorders and cancer 
until recently  we owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of rxi and our consolidated financial statements  including our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  included in this annual report  reflected of the assets  liabilities and results of operations of rxi  and the interest of the minority shareholders was recorded as minority interest 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend  payable to our stockholders as of march   the record date  of one share of rxi common stock for each approximately shares of our common stock held by such stockholders 
the dividend was paid on march  the rxi shares distributed by us to our stockholders constituted approximately of the currently outstanding rxi shares  so we currently own approximately of the outstanding shares of rxi common stock 
for periods beginning with the first quarter of  if cytrx owns more than but less than of the outstanding shares of rxi  cytrx will account for its investment in rxi using the equity method 
under the equity method  cytrx will record its pro rata share of the gains or losses of rxi against its historical basis investment in rxi 
research and development expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  with research and development expenses representing approximately  and of our total expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents research and development expenses are further discussed below under critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations 
our currently projected expenditures for include approximately million for our clinical program for arimoclomol for als and related studies  approximately million for our planned clinical trial of arimoclomol in stroke patients and our clinical trial of iroxanadine for diabetic ulcers 
the actual cost of our clinical programs could differ significantly from our current projections due to any additional requirements or delays imposed by the fda in connection with our planned trials  or if actual costs are higher than current management estimates for other reasons 
in the event that actual costs of our clinical program  or any of our other ongoing research activities  are significantly higher than our current estimates  we may be required to significantly modify our planned level of operations 
there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including our molecular chaperone amplification technology and rxi s rnai related technologies 
the successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any product candidate  due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to advance product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of our products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock options  impairment of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  accrued liabilities and certain expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition biopharmaceutical revenues consist of license fees from strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies as well as service and grant revenues 
service revenues consist of contract research and laboratory consulting 
grant revenues consist of government and private grants 
monies received for license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
milestone payments will be recognized upon achievement of the milestone as long as the milestone is deemed substantive and we have no other performance obligations related to the milestone and collectability is reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt  or recognized upon termination of the agreement and all related obligations 
deferred revenue represents amounts received prior to revenue recognition 
revenues from contract research  government grants  and consulting fees are recognized over the respective contract periods as the services are performed  provided there is persuasive evidence or an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
once all conditions of the grant are met and no contingencies remain outstanding  the revenue is recognized as grant fee revenue and an earned but unbilled revenue receivable is recorded 
in august  we received approximately million in proceeds from the privately funded als charitable remainder trust alscrt in exchange for the commitment to continue research and development of arimoclomol and other potential treatments for als and a one percent royalty in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol 
under the arrangement  we retain the rights to any products or intellectual property funded by the arrangement and the proceeds of the transaction are non refundable 
further  the alscrt has no obligation to provide any further funding to us 
we have concluded that due to the research and development components of the transaction that it is properly accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 research and development arrangements 
accordingly  we have recorded the value received under the arrangement as deferred service revenue and will recognize service revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition  meaning that service revenue is recognized on a dollar for dollar basis for each dollar of expense incurred for the research and development of arimoclomol and other potential als treatments 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended related to the services provided 
we adjust our estimates of expense incurred for this research and development on a quarterly basis 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  of service revenue related to this transaction 
any significant change in als related research and development expense in any particular quarterly or annual period will result in a change in the recognition of revenue for that period and consequently affect the comparability or revenue from period to period 
the amount of deferred revenue  current portion is the amount of deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized in the next twelve months and is subject to fluctuation based upon management s estimates 
management s estimates include an evaluation of what pre clinical and clinical trials are necessary  the timing of when trials will be performed and the estimated clinical trial expenses 
these estimates are subject to changes and could have a significant effect on the amount and timing of when the deferred revenues are recognized 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for direct and overhead related research expenses and are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies  including licenses  that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
technology developed for use in its products is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  include obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we recognize expenses for these activities based on a variety of factors  including actual and estimated labor hours  clinical site initiation activities  patient enrollment rates  estimates of external costs and other activity based factors 
we believe that this method best approximates the 
table of contents efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
if our estimates are incorrect  clinical trial expenses recorded in any particular period could vary 
stock based compensation our share based employee compensation plans are described in note of the notes to our financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r  which requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with stock option grants and other equity instruments to employees in the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all grants after the effective date and to the unvested portion of stock options outstanding as of the effective date 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method and use the black scholes valuation model for valuing share based payments 
we will continue to account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees  in accordance with sfas r  emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services and eitf  accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees  as amended 
our statement of operations as of and for the years ended december  and reflects the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our results of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations for all awards granted to employees 
under apb  when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans equals or exceeds the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans is less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period 
non employee share based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
in certain circumstances  option grants to non employees are immediately vested and have no future performance requirements by the non employee and the total share based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date 
the fair value of each cytrx and rxi common stock option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses certain assumptions related to risk free interest rates  expected volatility  expected life of the common stock options and future dividends 
compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the black scholes option pricing model  based on an expected forfeiture rate that is adjusted for actual experience 
if our black scholes option pricing model assumptions or our actual or estimated forfeiture rate are different in the future  that could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  for impairment on an annual basis  as of december  or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of such assets below their carrying values 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
if our estimates used in the determination of either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods are not accurate as compared to actual future results we may be required to record an impairment charge 
earnings per share basic and diluted loss per common share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
common share equivalents which consist of options and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share since the effect would be antidilutive 
common share equivalents which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future  and which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share  totaled approximately million shares  million shares and million shares at december   and  respectively 
in connection with our adjustment to the exercise terms of certain outstanding warrants to purchase common stock on march  and january   we recorded deemed dividends of  and million  respectively 
these deemed dividends are reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of and the year ended to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 

table of contents quarterly financial data the following table sets forth unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each quarter during our most recent two fiscal years 
this quarterly information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered 
the quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
quarters ended march june september december in thousands  except per share data total revenues net loss deemed dividend for anti dilution adjustments made to outstanding common stock warrants net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock total revenues net loss deemed dividend for anti dilution adjustments made to outstanding common stock warrants net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock quarterly and yearly loss per share amounts are computed independently of each other 
therefore  the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not equal the per share amounts for the year 
in  we adopted sfas r  and in and we incurred million and million  respectively  in employee non cash compensation expenses 
no corresponding expense was recorded in in connection with our adjustment to the exercise terms of certain outstanding warrants to purchase common stock on march  and january   we recorded deemed dividends of  and million  respectively 
these deemed dividends are reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of and the year ended to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statements of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 
fourth quarter adjustment during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded adjustments for i additional compensation expense of  related to previously granted non employee stock options  ii additional compensation expense of  related to stock options previously granted to directors and iii additional general and administrative expense of  related to legal fees rendered during the third quarter 
management concluded the effect of these adjustments was not material to any previously reported quarterly period 
liquidity and capital resources general at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  including million held by rxi compared to million at december  our working capital totaled million and our total assets were million at december   compared to million and million  respectively  at december  as of march   we also had received approximately million in connection with the exercise of warrants and options since december  we have relied primarily upon selling equity securities and upon proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants and  to a much lesser extent  upon payments from our strategic partners and licensees  to generate funds needed to finance our business and operations 
we believe that our current resources will be sufficient to support our currently planned level of operations into the second half of this estimate is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million  including approximately million for our clinical program for arimoclomol for als and related studies  approximately million for our planned phase ii clinical trial of arimoclomol in stroke patients and phase ii clinical trial of iroxanadine for diabetic ulcers  approximately million for equipping and operating our research laboratory in san diego  california  and approximately million for other general and administrative expenses 
management believes that rxi s current resources will be sufficient to support its currently planned level of operations into the second quarter of we anticipate it will take a minimum of 
table of contents three years and possibly longer for us to generate recurring revenue  and we will be dependent on obtaining future financing until such time  if ever  as we can generate significant recurring revenue 
we have no commitments from third parties to provide us with any additional future financing  and may not be able to obtain future financing on favorable terms  or at all 
discussion of operating  investing and financing activities net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million of non cash revenue recognized under the agreement with alscrt and million for stock option and warrant expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash provided from operating activities for that period was million 
the cash provided from operating activities includes net proceeds of million received from alscrt reflected in august in connection with the sale of a one percent royalty interest in our worldwide sales of arimoclomol for als 
reflected in the net loss of million is million of revenue recognized in in connection with that sale 
the remaining million of the net proceeds from that sale were recorded as deferred revenues 
other non cash items included in our net loss necessary to reconcile cash provided from operating activities include million in stock option expense related to options granted to employees and consultants  of which million of expenses for employee options recorded under sfas r  which we adopted in  and accordingly no corresponding amount was recorded in earlier periods 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million  which resulted in net cash used in operating activities of million 
adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  were primarily  of stock option expense related to options granted to consultants  as well as a net change in assets and liabilities of  offset by the recording of  in depreciation and amortization 
for the year ended december   million was used in investing activities 
of this amount  million was used by rxi for the purchase of short term investments 
the other million was used for the purchase of equipment and furnishings  primarily associated with equipping the new san diego laboratory 
for the year ended december   only a small amount of cash was used in investing activities 
for the year ended december   the only significant investing activity was the redemption of an approximately million certificate of deposit 
other investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of small amounts of computers and laboratory equipment cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we raised million in a private placement of our common stock and an additional million from the exercise of previously outstanding stock options and warrants 
during  we raised million through a private placement of our common stock and an additional million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during the year ended december   we raised million through a private placement of common stock 
we believe that we have adequate working capital to allow us to operate at our currently planned levels into the second half of we may require additional capital in order to fund the completion of our clinical programs for arimoclomol for the treatment of als and for stroke recovery and iroxanadine for diabetic ulcers  and the other ongoing research and development related to our molecular chaperone amplification drug candidates 
we may incur substantial additional expense and our clinical programs may be delayed if the fda requires us to generate additional pre clinical or clinical data in connection with the clinical trials  or the fda requires us to revise significantly our planned protocols for our planned clinical trials 
we intend also to pursue other sources of capital  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
our ability to obtain future financings through joint ventures  product licensing arrangements  equity financings  gifts  and grants or otherwise is subject to market conditions and out ability to identify parties that are willing and able to enter into such arrangements on terms that are satisfactory to us 
depending upon the outcome of our fundraising efforts  the accompanying financial information may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results or future financial condition 
we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and there can be no assurance that we will become profitable 
even if we become profitable  we may not be able to sustain that profitability 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual obligations we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required  contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by a regulatory agency 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
these arrangements may be material individually  and in the unlikely event that milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
as a result of rxi s separation from cytrx in march see discussion in the our separation from rxi pharmaceuticals corporation section on page  each of cytrx and rxi will be responsible for their respective future contractual obligations  therefore  they are shown separately below 
cytrx s current contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows non cancelable cancelable operating employment research and license leases agreements subtotal development agreements subtotal in thousands total and thereafter total rxi s current contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows non cancelable cancelable operating employment research and license leases agreements subtotal development agreements subtotal in thousands total and thereafter total operating leases are primarily facility lease related obligations  as well as equipment and software lease obligations with third party vendors 

table of contents employment agreement obligations include management contracts  as well as scientific advisory board member compensation agreements 
certain agreements  which have been revised from time to time  provide for minimum salary levels  adjusted annually at the discretion of our compensation committee  as well as for minimum bonuses 
research and development obligations relate primarily to clinical trials 
most of these purchase obligations are cancelable 
license agreements generally relate to rxi s obligations with umms associated with rnai and  for future periods  represent minimum annual royalty payment obligations 
not included in the table are milestone payment amounts that may be required under rxi s license agreements  due to their contingent nature 
rxi has determined that a hypothetical product candidate attaining all possible product milestones would have aggregate potential milestone payments of million 
this hypothetical product analysis was undertaken since rxi has not yet named a lead product candidate 
rxi determined what would be a like product candidate based on its current research and ran an analysis of the milestone payments due under its current licenses for this hypothetical product 
as a part of this analysis  due to the fact that certain of its licenses are for technologies that are mutually exclusive  if any two licenses are mutually exclusive and only one would be applicable to any single product  rxi selected the milestone payments that would result in higher fees to include in its analysis 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had united states federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset against future taxable income  which expire in through as a result of a change in control that occurred in our shareholder base in july  approximately million in federal net operating loss carryforwards became limited in their availability to million annually 
management currently believes that the remaining million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  and the million in state net operating loss carryforwards  are unrestricted 
however  we are reviewing our recent equity transactions to determine if they may have resulted in any further restrictions on our net operating loss carryforwards 
additionally  due to the change in control  approximately million of research and development tax credits will not be available for utilization and were written off 
as of december   we also had research and development and orphan drug credits for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available for offset against future income taxes  which expire in through based on an assessment of all available evidence including  but not limited to  our limited operating history in our core business and lack of profitability  uncertainties of the commercial viability of our technology  the impact of government regulation and healthcare reform initiatives  and other risks normally associated with biotechnology companies  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards and credits will not be realized and  as a result  a deferred income tax valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets 
results of operations we recorded net losses of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recognized million in service revenues relating to our million sale to the alscrt of a one percent royalty interest in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol in august this compares to million in services revenues in the year ended december   of which million related to the sale of royalty interest sold to alscrt 
during and  we earned an immaterial amount of license fees and grant revenue 
in the year ended december   we earned an immaterial amount of service and license fee revenue 
all future licensing fees under our current licensing agreements are dependent upon successful development milestones being achieved by the licensor 
during fiscal  we are not anticipating the receipt of any significant service or licensing fees  although we estimate that we will recognize an additional million in service revenues from that arimoclomol royalty transaction 
we will continue to recognize the balance of the deferred revenue recorded from the royalty transaction with the als charitable remainder trust based on actual research and development costs incurred over the development period of our arimoclomol research 

table of contents research and development years ended december  in thousands research and development expense non cash research and development expense employee stock option expense research expenses are expenses incurred by us in the discovery of new information that will assist us in the creation and the development of new drugs or treatments 
development expenses are expenses incurred by us in our efforts to commercialize the findings generated through our research efforts 
research and development expenses incurred during  and relate primarily to i our phase ii clinical program for arimoclomol in als  ii our ongoing research and development related to other molecular chaperone amplification drug candidates  iii rxi s acquisition of technologies covered by the umms license agreements  iv our prior collaboration and invention disclosure agreement pursuant to which umms had agreed to disclose certain inventions to us and provide us with the right to acquire an option to negotiate exclusive licenses for those disclosed technologies  and v the small molecule drug discovery and development operations at our former massachusetts and new california laboratory 
all research and development costs related to the activities of rxi and our former laboratory were expensed 
as compensation to members of our scientific advisory board sab and consultants  and in connection with the acquisition of technology  we and rxi sometimes issue shares of common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever is more reliably measurable 
we recorded charges of million  million  and million in this regard during   and  respectively 
included in the research and development charges for were million of expense related to rxi s issuance of  shares of common stock to umms for certain license agreement rights and a new invention disclosure agreement and million for non qualifying stock options to sab members of rxi 
in  we recorded million of employee stock option expense as compared to million in and none in in  we expect our research and development expenses to increase primarily as a result of our clinical program with arimoclomol for als and related studies and our planned clinical trials of arimoclomol for stroke recovery and iroxanadine for diabetic ulcers 
additionally  rxi  our majority owned subsidiary  expects to increase their expenditures during related to their development of rnai therapeutics 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses stock  stock option and warrant expenses to non employees and consultants employee stock option expense general and administrative expenses include all administrative salaries and general corporate expenses  including legal expenses associated with the prosecution of our intellectual property 
our general and administrative expenses  excluding common stock  stock options and warrants issued  and excluding depreciation expense  were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses increased by million in as compared to primarily due to increased audit  legal and consulting fees and higher employment costs 
audit fees associated with our annual audit  compliance with the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act and rxi s registration statement relating to our partial spinoff of rxi increased by approximately million 
legal fees increased by approximately million primarily related to rxi s registration statement  increased patent work  license negotiation fees and other legal matters  including possible financing transactions 
recruiting and consulting fees increased by approximately million related to recruiting officers  financial and scientific personnel and consultants assisting with the preparation of rxi s registration statement on form s employment costs increased by approximately million related to wages and bonuses for additional personnel for rxi and annual increases for other employees 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by million in as compared to as a result of initial sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts  an increase in administrative salaries and legal expenses 
the legal expense increase of million was associated with maintenance of our patent portfolio and the formation of rxi 
in our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in consulting  audit and accounting system conversion expense 
we were required to comply with the attestation requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act for the first time for the year ended december   therefore  there are no corresponding expenses in in  our general and administrative salaries increased by million over the expense level as a result of a higher bonuses  additional regulatory and accounting personnel and annual salary increases 
from time to time  we issue shares of our common stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock to consultants and other service providers in exchange for services 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever we can measure more reliably 
we recorded no such charges during  million during and million during related primarily to common stock  stock options and warrants issued for licensing fees and in connection with the engagement and retention of financial  business development and scientific advisors 
since our adoption of sfas r during  we recorded million in fiscal and million in fiscal of employee stock option expense 
no corresponding expense existed in the increase in over primarily related to stock options granted by rxi to recruit and retain directors  officers and additional employees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
the depreciation expense reflects the depreciation of our fixed assets and the amortization expenses related to our molecular library  which was placed in service in march other income in june  we recognized million of income arising from a fee received pursuant to a change in control provision included in the purchase agreement for our sale of our animal pharmaceutical unit 
management concluded that the fee did not represent revenue generated from our normal course of our business  and accordingly we recorded this fee as other income 
interest income interest income was  in  as compared to  in and  in the variances between years are attributable primarily to the amount of funds available for investment each year and  to a lesser extent  changes in prevailing market rates 
minority interest in losses of subsidiary we recorded  in related to the minority interest in losses of our former cytrx laboratories subsidiary 
there was no minority interest in losses recorded in  since on june  we repurchased the minority interest from dr 
michael czech 
on september   we merged cytrx laboratories into cytrx 
we recorded million in related to the minority interest in losses of rxi 
until recently  we owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of rxi and our consolidated financial statements  including our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  included in this annual report  reflected of the assets and liabilities of rxi  and the ownership of the interests of the minority shareholders was recorded as minority interests 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend  payable to our stockholders as of march   the record date  of one share of rxi common stock for each approximately shares of our common stock held by such stockholders
