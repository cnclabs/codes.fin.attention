the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in estimating risk 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our financial statements could change 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has two basic components the specific allowance for impaired credits and the general allowance based on relevant risk factors 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for loans identified for impairment testing 
impairment testing includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  support available from financial guarantors and the fair market value of collateral 
these factors are combined to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
when impairment is identified  a specific reserve is established based on bankshares calculation of the loss embedded in the individual loan 
large groups of smaller balance and homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  bankshares does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment testing unless loans become days or more past due 
the general allowance is determined by aggregating un criticized loans non classified loans and loans identified for impairment testing for which no impairment was identified by loan type based on common purpose  collateral  repayment source or other credit characteristics 
we then apply allowance factors which in the judgment of management represent the expected losses over the life of the loans 
in determining those factors  we consider the following delinquencies and overall risk ratings  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of the borrowers management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit by individual credit size and by class of loans  quality of loan review system and the effect of external factors eg  competition and regulatory requirements 
this is the largest component of the overall allowance 
goodwill bankshares adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
based on the results of these tests  bankshares concluded that there was no impairment  and no write downs were recorded 
additionally  under sfas no 
 acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over its useful life 
the costs of other intangible assets  based on independent valuation and or internal valuations  are being amortized over their estimated lives not to exceed fifteen years 
share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options and nonvested shares  based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant and eliminates the choice to account for employee stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

bankshares adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method and as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 
compensation cost has been measured using the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period

this decrease is primarily attributable to the substantial increase the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the following table illustrates average balances of total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated  showing the average distribution of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and related income  expense and corresponding weighted average yields and rates 
the average balances used in these tables and other statistical data were calculated using daily average balances

the following table describes the impact on our interest income and expense resulting from changes in average balances and average rates for the periods indicated

the net interest income was adversely impacted by the lower earnings rates associated with earning assets and the significant increase in interest expense 
non performing assets performing loans with a specific allowance allocation 
as of december   impaired loans amounted to million  compared to an impaired loan balance of thousand as of december  the majority of the million is made up of two loans  one for million which is a series of equipment loans and a line of credit to a single borrower involved in real estate development activities  and one for million which is secured by a completed available for sale single family residence in northern virginia 
nonaccrual loans 
a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent days or more 
we closely monitor individual loans  and relationship officers are charged with working with customers to resolve potential credit issues in a timely manner with minimum exposure to us 
we maintain a policy of adding an appropriate amount to the allowance for loan losses to ensure an adequate reserve based on the portfolio composition  specific credit extended by alliance bank and general economic conditions 
on december   alliance bank had million in loans that were on nonaccrual compared to two loans that were on nonaccrual status totaling thousand at december  the increase relates substantially to four borrowing relationships with one of those representing five projects 
the largest relationship includes project loans totaling million as of december  which consists of two single family residential construction loans and three real estate land loans

we have allocated million and thousand  respectively  of our allowance for loan losses at december  and december  for specific non performing loans 
in  we had net charge offs of million compared to thousand in and thousand in as of december   there were no loans past due days and still accruing interest 
as part of our routine credit administration process  we engage an outside consulting firm to review our loan portfolio periodically 
the information from these reviews is used to monitor individual loans as well as to evaluate the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each period  management takes into consideration the historical loan losses experienced by the organization  current economic conditions affecting the borrowers ability to repay  the volume of loans  trends in delinquent  nonaccruing  and potential problem loans  and the quality of collateral securing loans 
after charging off all known losses which have been incurred in the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover its estimate of probable losses

however  management does not believe that the allowance for loan losses can be fragmented by category with any precision that would be useful to investors 
as such  the entire allowance is available for losses in any particular category  not withstanding this allocation 
the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses is based primarily upon those factors discussed above in computing the allowance for loan losses as a whole 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the allocation and actual results are not necessarily indicative of the exact category of potential loan losses

we believe that adopting the provisions of these accounting standards provides a more realistic long term view of our balance sheet and provides the opportunity to achieve our goal of reducing volatility in reported earnings

the bulk of the loss is the mark to market adjustments on liabilities 
as bankshares has downsized the total balance sheet  there has been a mismatch between assets and liabilities 
this mismatch is causing more volatility in the financial results than expected 
for the year ended december   the net loss on trading activity and fair value adjustments was million

deposits we have made a special effort to obtain deposits from title and mortgage loan closing companies  which generally provide a good source of non interest bearing deposits 
we have developed products and services using available technology that meet the needs of these customers 
the balances on deposit with us tend to fluctuate greatly during any given month  depending on transaction scheduling and overall market conditions 
these balances represent a substantial portion of our non interest bearing deposits 
these deposits are subject to significant reduction during slower real estate markets  as evidenced in late and in order to meet the withdrawal needs of these customers  we monitor our liquidity  investment securities and lines of credit on a constant basis 
we have sold and will in the future sell investment securities as a source of liquidity 
we seek deposits within our market area by paying competitive interest rates  offering high quality customer service and using technology to deliver deposit services effectively

certificates of deposit in were million  a decrease of million from the level of million 
as the business activity changes  and particularly if average title and mortgage loan closing deposits decline  we may occasionally use wholesale or brokered deposits

we used wholesale funding to offset funding gaps as necessary 
at december  and december   we had million of brokered deposits that relate to a state government program

this type of funding is a tool to support the growth of the bank and liquidity needs

the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb is a key source of funding for the organization 
during the periods presented we have used overnight advances daily rate credit to support our short term liquidity needs 
on a longer term basis we use fhlb advances to augment our funding portfolio

liquidity our overall asset liability strategy takes into account the need to maintain adequate liquidity to fund asset growth and deposit runoff 
our liquidity is impacted by the general growth of the bank  the growth of abmd  the growth of aia  title company balances  qualified intermediary balances and the national and local mortgage refinance market and the trading and investment portfolios 
we use a variety of tools to manage our liquidity 
these include pricing on loans and deposits  purchase or sale of investments  brokered deposits  the sale or participation of loans  and rates and fees on home mortgages 
in addition  we have a variety of credit facilities at our disposal 
our funding department monitors our overall position daily 
we can and will draw upon federal funds lines with correspondent banks  reverse repurchase agreement lines with correspondent banks and use fhlb advances 
our deposit customers frequently have lower deposit balances in the middle of each month 
the deposit balances generally rise toward the end of each month 
as such  we use wholesale funding techniques to support our overall balance sheet growth

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
in  we engaged a consulting firm to assist management in developing best practices in the alm process 
a core component of the project was the development of a more in depth alm model that measures nii and eve results on a monthly basis 
recent results indicate that we are positioned well for rising interest rates 
the board of directors has approved nii and eve metrics for policy measurement and as of the most recent model run december  we are in compliance with all policy metrics 
the short term interest rate model nii indicates we are asset sensitive 
the long term model eve indicates a stable to slightly declining eve in a rising interest rate environment 
net interest income sensitivity 
bankshares alm process evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
this analysis involves shocking the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of bankshares shorter term interest rate risk 
this analysis is accomplished by assuming a static balance sheet over a period of time with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under various rate scenarios 
these assumptions might include prepayments  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant by bankshares 
the alm results for december  are shown in the table below 
assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points  the results indicate bankshares would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by 
assuming a shift downward of basis points  bankshares would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months by 
the results in both a rising and declining interest rate environment are within the policy guidelines 
economic value of equity 
the economic value process models the cashflows of financial instruments to maturity 
the model incorporates growth and pricing assumptions to develop a baseline eve 
the interest rates used in the model are then shocked for an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the results of the shocked model are compared to the baseline results to determine the percentage change in eve under the various scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
bankshares is in compliance with the board approved eve guidelines in all scenarios 
the table below shows as of december  and alm model results under various interest rate shocks december  december  interest rate shocks nii eve nii eve bp bp bp bp interest rate gap 
in addition to the nii and eve models  management reviews our static gap position 
the cumulative negative gap position within one year was million  or of total assets  at december  while this measurement technique is common in the financial services industry  it has limitations and is not our sole tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
we do not believe this model accurately reflects bankshares true short and long term interest rate exposure 
as an example  million of the trading securities at december  are classified as greater than five years due to the contractual maturity of the instruments 
trading assets are easily marketed and can be liquidated in a short period of time 
as a result  it is reasonable to consider a portion of  or perhaps all of  the million of trading assets as the within three month category  which further suggests an asset sensitive position for bankshares 
the following table reflects our december  static interest rate gap position december  maturing or repricing within over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities trading securities loans held for sale loans interest bearing deposits federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market deposit accounts savings accounts iras time deposits  at fair value total interest bearing deposits fhlb long term advances  at fair value customer repurchase agreements other borrowings trust preferred capital notes total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap total assets interest rate risk management summary 
as part of our interest rate risk management  we typically use the investment portfolio to balance our interest rate exposure 
the pricing of deposits is adjusted within the market area to favor money market or certificates of deposit depending on the need for floating or fixed rate liabilities 
the pricing of loan products is a function of interest rate risk management strategies and the market conditions in the area 
in many cases  interest rate risk pricing desires are not consistent with the general market  which requires us to balance our interest rate risk through other products 
an example of this is that in a rising rate environment  the loan customer typically prefers fixed rate loans and banks typically desire floating rate loans 
in this example  we would add floating rate or adjustable securities or price certificates of deposit aggressively to balance the interest rate risk 
the interest sensitivity position does not measure the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of our investment securities portfolio 
rising interest rates will cause a decline in the market value of our investment securities 
a decline in the market value of the investment portfolio could make managing the net interest income exposure more difficult 
there is no guarantee that the risk management and balance sheet management strategies we employ will be effective in periods of rapid rate movements 
we believe our strategies are prudent and within policy guidelines in the base case of our modeling efforts as of december
