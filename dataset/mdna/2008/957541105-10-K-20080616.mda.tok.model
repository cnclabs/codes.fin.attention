item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references herein to the term fiscal year shall mean a year ended march of the year specified 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its osplant systems product lines  particularly the sale of niu products and related products 
niu products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company introduced its first cne products in fiscal and these products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
niu products and cne products are the two major products within the company s telecom equipment business 
telecom equipment constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal  which constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company realizes the majority of its revenues from the north american market 
the company is comprised of two segments telecom equipment and telecom service 
the telecom equipment segment of the company s business consists of two product lines  offering a broad range of products that facilitate the broadband transmission of high speed digital and analog data between a telephone company s central office and end user customers 
these two product lines are cne the company s family of broadband products enables high speed transport and networking of voice  data and video services 
the products allow service providers to deliver services  content  and applications over existing copper  fiber  and wireless infrastructures 
westell cne is typically installed in consumer residences as a key component of a broadband service package 
osplant systems the company s osplant systems product family consists of next generation outdoor cabinets  enclosures  power distribution  edge connectors  remote monitoring and ancillary network protection solutions 
these solutions are ideal for wireless backhaul and service delivery to enterprise markets as well as wireless carrier  mso and utility markets worldwide 
the power distribution and remote monitoring solutions are provided through the company s noran tel subsidiary 
the company s telecom service segment is comprised of a owned subsidiary  conferenceplus  inc conferenceplus provides audio  video  and web conferencing services 
businesses and individuals use these services to hold voice  video or web conferences with multiple participants 
conferenceplus sells its services directly to large customers  including fortune companies  and serves other customers indirectly through its private label reseller program 
the prices for the products within each market group vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria and are subject to change due to competition among telecommunications manufacturers and service providers 
increasing competition  in terms of the number of entrants and their size  and increasing size of the company s customers because of past mergers  continues to exert downward pressure on prices for the company s products 
the company s customer base is highly concentrated and comprised primarily of major us telecommunications service providers telephone companies  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to launch new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
the company is focusing on expanding its product offerings in the equipment segment from basic high speed broadband to more sophisticated applications such as voip  in premises networking  wireless wireline convergence  ip multimedia subsystem ims and fmc  video iptv and multifunctional broadband appliances 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which could adversely affect short term results of operations 
the company expects to increase spending in research and development and sales and marketing in fiscal year in an attempt to take advantage of these market opportunities 
in view of the company s current reliance on the telecommunications market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in the cne equipment segment  the company is focusing on the evolving broadband demand  which includes increased bandwidth  richer application sets and converged capabilities 
the company has introduced products for both the existing local telephone and fiber network including the ultraline  proline  versalink  and trilink  which are targeted at the home networking  soho and small business markets the company has multiple evaluations and is entering trials for trilink  trilink ims and ultraline series the company has increased its focus and marketing efforts on new customers such as msos and wireless carriers and is currently participating in field trials at one of the largest msos in north america 
the company expects the overall osplant systems market to increase due to the introduction of new products and new sales channels 
the company acquired of the common stock of noran tel  inc on january  with the addition of noran tel  the company has obtained a canadian market channel for some of its existing products  has added additional transmission products to offer in its existing sales channels and has gained new products in the areas of power distribution and remote monitoring 
the company also plans to invest in new product areas to compliment wireless and fiber applications 
recent developments regarding conferenceplus the company previously disclosed that it was pursuing strategic alternatives for its conferenceplus business unit 
on june   the company announced that it has decided not to pursue a divestiture of conferenceplus at this time 
conferenceplus was informed by its second largest customer that the customer intends to transfer all business to another conferencing provider 
the transition by this customer occurred in the first fiscal quarter of and is substantially complete 
the revenue from this customer was million in fiscal year conferenceplus may need to consider potential acquisition or restructuring activities to continue to meet expected operating results as a result of this customer loss 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies that have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company sells products primarily to various telecommunications providers and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables based on aging  historical experience and customer s financial condition 
historically  we have not had significant losses due to the inability for the company to collect delinquent accounts 
however  bankruptcy by a significant customer would have a material impact on our results of operations 
inventory reserves the company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reserve for obsolete and potential obsolete inventory 
the company also evaluates inventory valuation for lower of cost or market concerns 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into commitments for the purchase of inventory and long distance telephone services 
the commitments are at market rates 
should there be a dramatic decline in revenues the company may incur excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company has established reserves for potential losses on such commitments 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
goodwill and intangibles pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill of the reporting unit would be considered impaired 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss  the impaired fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
an impairment charge of approximately million was taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal year at the westell inc reporting unit 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
share based compensation effective april   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  and therefore did not restate prior periods 
sfas r requires the grant date fair value recognition of expense related to employee stock based compensations awards over the requisite service period

additionally  sfas no 
r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow instead of as an operating cash flow as required under previous accounting literature

the local currency for all subsidiaries has been designated as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities have been translated into u

 in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross margin net income loss net income loss per common share basic diluted the quarterly fluctuations in revenue are due primarily to fluctuations in the cne product line of the equipment segment 
these fluctuations are due to product mix between the modem and versalink products within cne  quantity shipped and generally declining sales prices 
the decrease in revenue in the december  quarter was due primarily to the company concluding shipping of cne products under a bellsouth agreement in october of quarterly gross margin was impacted primarily by price repression in the cne product line of the equipment segment 
the margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal was negatively impacted by million of excess and obsolete inventory expense recorded 
net income in the june  quarter was positively impacted by a million gain related to the recovery of product warranty costs from a vendor and negatively impacted by million in restructuring cost recorded relating to the company s outsourcing plan 
net income in the march  quarter was impacted by an additional restructuring charge of million 
in addition  the company recorded tax expense of million relating primarily to valuation allowance all deferred tax assets in that quarter 
the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
some factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include  but are note limited to  the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and profitability

the credit agreement is a three year revolving credit facility in an amount up to million that expires on june  the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by a guaranty from certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the company  and substantially all of the assets of the company 
any proceeds from the revolving loans would be used for working capital purposes  acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
the interest rate spread in the case of libor and base rate loans and the payment of the non use fees is dependent on the company s leverage ratio 
currently the revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest  at the company s option  at the london interbank offered rate libor plus or an alternative base rate 
the alternative base rate is the greater of the lasalle bank national association prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the company is also required to pay a non use fee of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving loans 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum tangible net worth test  a total leverage ratio test consolidated total debt to ebitda  and a limitation on capital expenditures for any fiscal year

the company believes cash on hand and generated from operations will satisfy its future cash requirements for the next twelve months
