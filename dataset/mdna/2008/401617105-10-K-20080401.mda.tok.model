executive summary the company the company s operations generated net earnings of million  or diluted earnings of per share  for the year ended february   compared to net earnings of million  or diluted earnings of per share  for the year ended february  total net revenues increased to  million for the year ended february   from  million for the year ended february  all of our business segments contributed to this growth 
the european segment was the largest contributor to the growth in revenues representing roughly half of the consolidated revenue growth 
the revenue growth also reflected higher comparable store sales and retail store expansion in the retail segment 
in addition  our wholesale segment increased revenues  driven by our new south korea operation and stronger product performance in our north american wholesale business  while our licensing business increased revenues across all key accessories categories and footwear 
gross margin increased basis points to for the year ended february   compared to the same prior year period 
the improvement in the overall gross margin was attributable to a higher mix of european net revenues  which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other businesses  higher mark ups in our wholesale segment  higher product margins in our retail segment and the recognition of gift card breakage 
this improvement was partially offset by the lower product margin in europe 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million for the year ended february  compared to million for the year ended february  this increase in sg a expenses was driven by investments in our new businesses  higher variable costs to support the higher sales in our existing businesses  higher performance based expenses and investments in infrastructure in europe 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expense decreased basis points to for the year ended february   compared to the prior year 
overall  the higher gross margin and the decrease in sg a spending as a percentage of net revenues  resulted in an increase in the company s operating margin to for the year ended february   up basis points from for the year ended february  net interest income increased million for the year ended february  primarily due to the early redemption of the company s secured notes of million at the end of and higher average invested cash balances 
the secured notes were redeemed in december resulting in million related to the write off of debt issuance costs and payment of redemption premium  which are included in interest expense for the year ended february  other expense was million for the year ended february   versus other income of million for the year ended february  other expense in the year ended february  was primarily due to net losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates on forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions 
other income in the prior year period comprised gains on sale of land and other long term investments 
our effective income tax rate increased basis points to for the year ended february  compared to in the prior year primarily due to a higher mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions and a change to the italian tax rate effective in fiscal that unfavorably impacted our net deferred tax asset position at the end of fiscal the company had million in cash and cash equivalents as of february   compared to million as of february  total debt  including capital lease obligations  as of february   was million  up million from million as of february  the increase in debt was driven primarily by the increase in short term borrowings from guess europe 
accounts receivable increased by million  or  to million at february   compared to million at february  the increase in accounts receivable primarily supported the revenue growth in europe  south korea and greater china 
accounts receivable also increased due to the acquisition of barn in january currency translation fluctuations accounted for million of the increase in accounts receivable 
inventory increased by million  or  to million as of february   compared to million as of february  approximately million of this increase was attributable to new businesses including focus  barn  our new south korea operation  our mexico and greater china operations and our new g by guess store concept 
the remaining inventory increase was related to anticipated sales growth in our existing european and north american operations 
currency fluctuations resulted in a higher translation impact on the current year s ending inventory of approximately million compared to the year ago amount 
retail our retail segment  comprising north american full priced retail and factory outlet stores and e commerce  generated net sales of million during the year ended february   an increase of from million in the prior year period 
this growth was driven by a comparable store sales increase of and a larger store base  which represented a net increase in average square footage compared to the year ended february  all of our product categories contributed to this growth 
retail earnings from operations increased by million to million for the year ended february   compared to million for the year ended february  this increase was primarily driven by higher sales volume  higher product margin and occupancy leverage  partially offset by increased investments in infrastructure to support our new g by guess brand concept and higher advertising expense 
operating margin increased basis points to in the year ended february   compared to in the year ended february  in the year ended february   we opened new stores and closed ten underperforming stores in the us and canada 
at february   we operated stores in the us and canada  comprised of full priced retail stores  factory outlet stores  marciano stores  guess accessories stores and g by guess stores 
this compares to stores as of february  we have continued to develop our new concept stores  which includes our marciano branded stores and our g by guess stores  and we believe that over time these concepts can grow to become significant chains in north america 
the marciano brand  a contemporary line that commands higher price points  is also available in approximately a quarter of our full price guess retail stores in the us and canada 
g by guess  which launched in early  is a new brand and store concept that offers a full line of apparel for women and men and a full line of accessories and footwear to support the lifestyle of this customer and is aimed to capture a market demographic that is younger and shops price points between our factory and full priced retail stores 
wholesale wholesale segment revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended february   from million for the year ended february  the increase in net revenues was primarily due to international expansion  including south korea which we began to operate directly in january  coupled with growth in the north american wholesale business 
earnings from operations for the wholesale segment improved by million  or  to million for the year ended february   from million for the prior year period 
this improvement was driven by increased sales in asia and north america and higher gross margin as a result of higher mark ups in the north american wholesale business  partially offset by increased spending on infrastructure to support the growth of the new businesses in asia 
operating margin increased basis points to in the year ended february   compared to for the year ended february  europe in europe  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended february   compared to million for the year ended february  the majority of the revenue growth was generated by the european wholesale business  driven by growth in both our existing accessories and apparel businesses and our acquisition of a equity interest in focus on december   the company s licensee for guess by marciano contemporary apparel for women and men in europe  the middle east and asia 
in addition  at february   we directly operated stores in europe  which includes the four stores acquired as part of the focus acquisition  compared to stores in the prior year 
earnings from operations from our european segment increased by million  or  to million for the year ended february   from million for the year ended february  operating margin decreased basis points to in the year ended february   compared to for the year ended february  due to lower product margin and increased spending to support the growth of our infrastructure in the european region  including our investment in the new european headquarters based in lugano  switzerland 
licensing our licensing business revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended february   from million for the year ended february  this increase was driven by growth in sales of several product categories  especially handbags  footwear and watches  and the increased recognition of licensing revenues as a result of the amortization of fixed cash rights payments received from licensees in connection with previously renegotiated contracts based on the periods these contracts represent 
the increase in net royalties was partially offset by the loss of royalty revenue from our guess by marciano and south korean licensees  both of which we now operate directly and are  therefore  no longer a part of the licensing segment 
licensing segment earnings from operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended february   from million for the year ended february  operating margin decreased basis points to for the year ended february  compared to for the year ended february  due to higher spending in advertising and higher performance based compensation expense for the year compared to the prior year period 
outside of the us and canada  in the year ended february   together with our partners we opened new stores  including in europe  in asia and eight stores in mexico  central and south america 
we ended the year with stores outside of the us and canada  of which were guess stores  were guess by marciano stores  and were guess accessories stores 
of the stores  were operated by the company and were operated by licensees or distributors 
this store count does not include jean and accessory concessions located in south korea and china because of their smaller store size in relation to our standard international store size 
corporate overhead corporate overhead increased by million  or  to million in the year ended february   from million for the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to increased performance based compensation costs  including share based payment expense 
application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  sales return allowances  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes  workers compensation accruals  litigation accruals  pension obligations and stock based compensation 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria is performed 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues  and are included in the allowance for accounts receivable 
historically  these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of the economic conditions 
during fiscal  the company renegotiated its arrangements with its major customers in the us to fix the percentage of sales that will be expensed as markdown allowances 
the negotiation of a fixed rate allows the company to process credit memos against the outstanding balance immediately which has resulted in a reduction of our outstanding markdown allowance accrual relative to the prior year 
sales returns reserves the company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience 
the company s policy allows retail customers a day period to return merchandise following the date of sale 
substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost primarily weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors its off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
an asset is considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of the amendment of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions 
the discount rate is an important element of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
refer to note for supplemental executive retirement plan related information 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on any remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and will revise estimates as appropriate 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized for the year ended december  included a compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  fas and b compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for new grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility 
implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the company s common stock 
the expected life used prior to november was based on the simplified method described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
for options granted beginning november  the expected term is determined based on historical trends 
the dividend yield for the one month period ended february  and prior years was zero 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized and approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend 
the expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data 
compensation expense for new stock options and nonvested stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
taxes the company adopted fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  in january fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense

the company has entered into certain forward contracts and swaps to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for certain of these hedges 
the company s objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flow due to the foreign currency risk usd canadian exchange rate associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases on a first dollar basis for specific months 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of goods sold in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold 
the company has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses 
gift card breakage the company completed its analysis of unredeemed electronic gift card liabilities in the quarter ended august  for the us retail business 
gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods 
beginning with the quarter ended august   these amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed 
the company determined a gift card breakage rate of approximately in the quarter ended august  based upon historical redemption patterns  which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late based upon historical redemption trends  the company recognizes estimated gift card breakage as a component of net revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions  over the period that remaining gift card values are redeemed 
as of february   the company has recognized million gift card breakage to revenue  of which million  or per diluted share  was a one time cumulative adjustment recognized in the quarter ended august  any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk approximately half of product sales and licensing revenue recorded for the year ended february  were denominated in united states dollars 
the company s primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in canada and europe 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts and currency swaps  to manage exchange risk on foreign currency transactions 
the company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency 
during the year ended february   the company purchased us dollar forward contracts in canada totaling us million to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases that were designated as cash flow hedges 
as of february   approximately us million were outstanding and are expected to mature over the next eleven months 
our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates 
these forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases over specific months 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of goods sold in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold 
an unrealized loss of approximately us million  net of tax  primarily relating to contracts that have already matured  has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at february  and will be recognized as a charge to cost of goods sold on a pre tax basis over the next five months 
at february   the unrealized gain of the remaining open forward contracts recorded on the balance sheet was approximately us million 
also  the company has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses 
for the year ended february   the company recorded losses for the canadian and euro foreign currency contracts of us million and us million  respectively  which has been included in other income and expenses 
at february   the company had canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase us million  expected to mature over the next eleven months and euro foreign currency contracts to purchase us million  expected to mature over the next nine months 
at february   the unrealized losses of these canadian and euro forward contracts were approximately million  primarily relating to the euro forward contracts  and were recorded in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
at february   a sensitivity analysis to changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the us dollar indicates that  if the us dollar had uniformly weakened by against all of the foreign exchange derivatives  the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by us million 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all of the foreign exchange derivatives  the fair value of these instruments would have increased by us million 
any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments would have been partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate 
at december   the company had canadian dollar currency exchange contracts to purchase us million and euro currency exchange contracts to purchase us million 
the value of those contracts at december  were us million and us million  respectively  resulting in a net unrealized loss of us million 
interest rate risk at february   approximately of the company s indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation which is covered by interest rate swap agreements resulting in a fixed interest rate of over the life of the lease obligation 
changes in the related interest rate that result in an unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the swap are reported in other income or expenses 
the change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap had an immaterial impact during the year ended february  substantially all of the company s remaining indebtedness  principally consisting of short term borrowings under the short term european borrowing agreements  is at variable rates of interest 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s results of operations in future periods 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended february  by approximately million 
the fair value of the company s debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the company s borrowing rate 
at february   the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value  as the interest rate on the company s debt approximates rates currently available to the company
