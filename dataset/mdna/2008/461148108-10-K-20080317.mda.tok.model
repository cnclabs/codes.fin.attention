item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
words such as believes  expects  anticipates and the like indicate forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include comments related to our projected revenue  gross margin  operating expense  profitability  income tax expense  effective tax rate  capital spending and cash balances  the adequacy of our cash balances to fund our operations  projected volatility in our financial results  projected customer requirements for new capacity and technology upgrades for our installed base of magnetic disk manufacturing equipment and when  and if  our customers will place orders for these products  projected change from period to period in the customers  and location of customers  that constitute the majority of our revenues  the length of development  marketing and deployment cycles for military customers  imaging instrumentation s ability to proliferate its technology into major military weapons programs and to develop and introduce commercial products  and the timing of delivery and or acceptance of our backlog for revenue 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements for a variety of reasons  including those set forth under risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview intevac s business consists of two reportable segments equipment intevac is a leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of high productivity lean manufacturing systems and has been producing lean thinking platforms since we are the leading supplier of magnetic media sputtering equipment to the hard disk drive industry and offer leading edge  high productivity etch systems to the semiconductor industry 
imaging instrumentation intevac is a leader in the development of compact  cost effective  high sensitivity digital optical products for the capture and display of low light images and the optical analysis of materials 
we provide sensors  cameras and systems for commercial applications in the inspection  medical  scientific and security industries and for government applications such as night vision and long range target identification 
equipment business in the early s we developed a system  the mdp  to deposit magnetic films and protective overcoats onto magnetic disks used in hard disk drives 
this system gained wide acceptance and by the late s was being used to manufacture approximately half of the disks used in hard disk drives worldwide 
in late  we introduced a new system  the lean 
the hard disk drive industry has gone through significant consolidation  and there are now only seven significant manufacturers of magnetic disks  some of whom also manufacture hard disk drives 
as a result of the small number of customers and the high average selling price of our products  our equipment revenues tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our equipment business has historically been subject to capital spending cycles 
for example  in the period from through the middle of  we sold million of disk manufacturing equipment 
in the period from the middle of thru  our disk equipment revenues averaged approximately million per year and consisted of the sale of a limited number of systems  technology upgrades  parts and service for the installed base of our systems 
in  our sales of disk manufacturing equipment grew to million in annual revenues 
in  shipments of new disk sputtering systems declined and our revenue from sales of disk manufacturing equipment dropped to million 
in the past we also manufactured both deposition and rapid thermal processing equipment used in the manufacture of flat panel displays 
in late  we sold our rapid thermal processing product line and stopped actively marketing our flat panel deposition product line 
from through  cumulative revenues from sales of flat panel display manufacturing systems totaled million 
revenues included million from selling a license to one of our flat panel patents and recognizing revenue on the last flat panel system we shipped 

table of contents imaging instrumentation business developing advanced products for the military involves long development cycles  as products move through successive multi year stages of technology demonstration  engineering and manufacturing product development  prototype production and then product deployment 
each stage in this process requires ongoing government funding 
historically  much of our imaging instrumentation business revenues have been derived from contract research and development  rather than product sales 
in  in order to shorten the time to market and to increase the number of markets for our imaging products  we began to fund development of imaging products for commercial markets 
in january  we completed the acquisition of the assets and certain liabilities of deltanu  llc  a company that pioneered development of miniature raman spectrometer systems 
in november we completed and acquisition of the assets and certain liabilities of creative display systems  llc  a company that specializes in high performance  micro display products for near eye and portable applications in defense and commercial markets 
as a result of these activities and the internal development of new products for military and commercial applications  the percentage of imaging instrumentation revenues derived from product sales grew from in to in and is expected to continue to increase in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of our annual report on form k 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial conditions and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in our consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
many of these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
nonetheless  based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with us gaap  and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates related to the collectibility of trade receivables  customer advances  cash  cash equivalents and investments  and prototype product costs 
we believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operation for a given period 
revenue recognition certain of our system sales with customer acceptance provisions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have previously met defined customer acceptance levels with the specific type of system  then we recognize revenue for the fair market value of the system upon shipment and transfer of title  and recognize revenue for the fair market value of installation and acceptance services when those services are completed 
we 
table of contents estimate the fair market value of the installation and acceptance services based on our actual historical experience of the relative cost of such installation and acceptance services 
for systems that have generally not been demonstrated to meet a particular customer s product specifications prior to shipment  revenue recognition is typically deferred until customer acceptance 
for example  while initial shipments of our lean system were recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance during  revenue was recognized upon shipment for the majority of leans shipped in  and the systems in backlog at december  are for a customer for whom we have met defined customer acceptance levels  and we expect to recognize revenue upon shipment 
we anticipate that we will recognize revenue on our newly developed systems in upon customer acceptance  until such systems meet defined customer acceptance levels 
in some instances  hardware that is not essential to the functioning of the system may be delivered after acceptance of the system 
in these cases  we estimate the fair market value of the non essential hardware as if it had been sold on a stand alone basis  and defer recognizing revenue on that value until the hardware is delivered 
revenues for systems without installation and acceptance provisions  as well as revenues from technology upgrades  spare parts  consumables and products built by the imaging instrumentation business are recognized when title passes to our customer 
in certain cases  technology upgrade sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  usually split between delivery of the parts and installation on the customer s systems 
in these cases  we recognize revenue for the fair market value of the parts upon shipment and transfer of title  and recognize revenue for the fair market value of installation services when those services are completed 
in certain cases  we sell limited rights to our intellectual property 
revenue from the sale of any intellectual property license will generally be recognized at the inception of the license term 
we perform best efforts research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts 
these contracts are a mixture of cost plus fixed fee cpff and firm fixed price ffp 
revenue on cpff contracts is recognized in accordance with contract terms  typically as costs are incurred 
revenue on ffp contracts is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
provisions for estimated losses on government sponsored research contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
inventories inventories are priced using average actual costs and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering changes and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
a cost to market reserve is established for work in progress and finished goods inventories when the value of the inventory plus the estimated cost to complete exceeds the net realizable value of the inventory 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
our warranty is per contract terms and for our systems the warranty typically ranges between and months from customer acceptance 
for systems sold through our distributor  we offer a month warranty 
the remainder of any warranty period is the responsibility of the distributor 
during this warranty period any defective non consumable parts are replaced and installed at no charge to the customer 
the warranty period on consumable parts is limited to their reasonable usable lives 
we use estimated repair or replacement costs along with our historical warranty experience to determine our warranty obligation 
we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
we also provide for estimated retrofit costs  which typically relate to design changes or improvements we identify 
on a case by case basis  we determine whether or not to retrofit systems in the field at no charge to the customer 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   million of the deferred tax asset was valued on the balance sheet  net of a valuation allowance of million 
this represents the amount of the deferred tax asset from which we expect to realize a benefit 
we cannot predict with certainty when  or if  we will realize the benefit of the portion of the deferred tax asset currently offset with a valuation allowance 
on a quarterly basis  we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the level of our projected earnings  the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  net operating loss carry forwards  availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis 
if actual results differ from the estimates  this could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  as our projected level of earnings changed throughout and we benefited from various tax planning strategies  we decreased the annual effective tax rate from at the end of the first quarter  to at the end of the second quarter  to at the end of the third quarter and to at the end of the fourth quarter 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

the decrease in equipment revenues in was due primarily to a reduction in the number of lean systems delivered 
in we delivered twenty nine lean systems versus forty six lean systems delivered in equipment revenue in also included four disk lubrication systems and a significant increase in revenue from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts 
we sold a d star flat panel technology license for million 
during  we also sold thirteen disk lubrication systems and had significant sales of disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts 
during  we sold twenty three lean systems  six mdp systems and fourteen disk lubrication systems 
revenues also included million of flat panel equipment and license sales 
the magnetic disk manufacturing industry consists of a small number of large manufacturers 
in seagate acquired maxtor  and in june  western digital announced the acquisition of komag  both of which further concentrated our customer base 
we currently have seven lean systems either shipped or in backlog  which are scheduled for revenue recognition during we expect equipment revenues in to be significantly lower than in  due to fewer shipments of lean systems 

table of contents imaging instrumentation revenues increased by to million in  which consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
the million in imaging instrumentation revenue consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
the increase in product revenue resulted from higher sales of digital night vision camera modules and commercial products 
product revenue included contributions from deltanu  which was acquired on january   and creative display systems  which was acquired on november  the increase in contract research and development revenue was the result of a higher volume of contracts and incremental revenue generated from contract close outs 
the million in imaging instrumentation revenues consisted of  of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
in  we expect the imaging instrumentation revenue to grow significantly  due primarily to increased product sales 
during  we expect over of our revenue to come from product sales 
substantial growth in future imaging instrumentation revenues is dependent on proliferation of our technology into major military weapons programs  the ability to obtain export licenses for foreign customers  obtaining production subcontracts for these programs  and development and sale of commercial products 
our backlog of orders at december  was million  as compared to a december  backlog of million 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging instrumentation backlog 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging instrumentation backlog 
backlog at december  includes two lean systems  as compared to twenty four lean systems in backlog at december  during the first two months of  we have received orders for five additional lean systems 
significant portions of our revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers 
in sales to seagate  our japanese distributor  matsubo  hitachi global storage technologies  and fuji electric each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
in  seagate  matsubo  and hitachi global storage technologies each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
in  seagate  matsubo  hitachi global storage technologies and maxtor each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
international sales totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively  accounting for   and of net revenues 
the decrease in international sales in was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from disk sputtering systems 
the increase in international sales in was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems 
substantially all of our international sales are to customers in asia  which includes products shipped to overseas operations of us companies 
our mix of domestic versus international sales will change from period to period depending on the location of our largest customers in each period

equipment gross margin improved to in from in our product mix  higher average selling prices and cost reduction programs all contributed to the higher gross margin for the year 
equipment gross margin in improved over the gross margin achieved in due primarily to product mix  higher average selling prices  cost reduction programs and increased volume 
we expect the gross margin for the equipment business in to be somewhat lower than in  primarily as a result of a reduction in volume 
gross margins in the equipment business will vary depending on a number of additional factors  including product mix  product cost  system configuration and pricing  factory utilization  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
imaging instrumentation gross margin improved to in from in the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from higher margins on development contracts  favorable adjustments related to contract closeouts and increased product sales 
the improvement in imaging instrumentation gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to a higher percentage of contract research and development revenue being derived from fully funded contracts  favorable adjustments related to closing out prior year government rate audits and increased product shipments 
we expect the gross margin for the imaging instrumentation business in to improve over  primarily as a result of the projected increase in product sales  which typically carry higher gross margins

all domestic sales and international sales of disk sputtering products in asia  with the exception of japan  are typically made by intevac s direct sales force  whereas sales in japan of disk sputtering products and other products are typically made by our japanese distributor  matsubo  who provides services such as sales  installation  warranty and customer support 
we also have subsidiaries in singapore and in hong kong  along with field offices in japan  malaysia  korea and shenzhen  china to support our equipment customers in asia 
selling  general and administrative costs for and included million and million of equity based compensation expense  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative spending in was primarily the result of increases in costs related to business development  customer service and support in both the equipment and imaging instrumentation businesses  legal expenses associated with the unaxis litigation and higher equity based compensation expense 
our selling  general and administrative headcount increased from at the end of to at the end of  and to at the end of the increase in selling  general and administrative spending in was primarily the result of increases in costs related to business development  customer service and support in the equipment business  legal expenses associated with the unaxis litigation and provisions for employee profit sharing and bonus plans 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in over the amount spent in due primarily to a projected increase in costs related to customer service and support for the equipment business and the addition of key business development personnel in the imaging instrumentation business
