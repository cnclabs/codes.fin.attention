overview paetec is a competitive communications services and solutions provider guided by the principle that delivering superior customer service is the key to competing successfully with other communications services providers 
paetec s primary business is providing large  medium sized and  to a lesser extent  small business end user customers in metropolitan areas with a package of integrated communications services that includes local and long distance voice  data  and broadband internet access services 
paetec holding had approximately  employees as of march  as of march   excluding the effect of the mcleodusa merger  paetec holding had in service  digital t transmission lines  which represented the equivalent of  telephone lines  for over  business customers in a service area encompassing of the top metropolitan statistical areas 
to supplement its internal growth  paetec has pursued an acquisition strategy that it believes would allow it to increase penetration of its existing markets  expand into new markets  achieve operating efficiencies and enhance its ability to sell and deliver value added services 
in accordance with this strategy  paetec has focused its acquisition efforts on other competitive carriers  on local and long distance providers  on enhanced service providers  on network integrators and on equipment solutions providers 
on february   paetec corp 
completed its combination with us lec corp 
before the combination  which was effected by two mergers  which we sometimes refer to as the mergers or collectively as the us lec merger  paetec holding corp 
was a wholly owned subsidiary of paetec corp 
formed by paetec corp 
to complete the us lec merger 
paetec holding had no operations or material assets before the us lec merger 
as a result of the us lec merger  paetec corp 
and us lec corp 
became wholly owned subsidiaries of paetec holding 
us lec corp 
is a provider of internet protocol  data and voice services to medium sized and large businesses and enterprises in eastern states and the district of columbia 
on october   paetec completed its acquisition of allworx corp  a privately held company  for million in an all cash transaction 
allworx develops  designs  markets and sells a complete phone and network system 
the allworx business provides manufacturing  distribution  and software and digital hardware engineering services that are designed to benefit small and medium sized businesses 
on february   paetec completed its business combination by merger with mcleodusa incorporated 
in accordance with the merger agreement  mcleodusa became a wholly owned subsidiary of paetec upon completion of the merger 
mcleodusa provides integrated communication services to small and medium sized enterprises  and  to a lesser extent  traditional telephone and internet access services to small business and residential customers 

table of contents each of the foregoing merger transactions was accounted for as a purchase of the applicable company by paetec using the purchase method of accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  the assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities of each company as of the effective time of the merger were or will be recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of paetec 
any excess of purchase price over the net fair values of such company s assets and liabilities was or will be recorded as goodwill 
consolidated financial statements of paetec after the effective time of each transaction reflect or will reflect those fair values and will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of the acquired company 
the results of operations of each acquired company have been or will be combined with the results of operations of paetec and have been or will be included in the results of operations of paetec beginning on the effective date of the applicable transaction 
following each transaction  the earnings of paetec reflect or will reflect the effect of any additional indebtedness and purchase accounting adjustments  including any increased interest expense and depreciation and amortization of acquired assets 
in connection with its acquisition of us lec  paetec obtained million of new senior secured credit facilities on february  and applied the proceeds of the facilities primarily to refinance or retire substantially all of the indebtedness of the two companies and to repurchase us lec s outstanding preferred stock 
in july  paetec amended its senior secured credit facilities and prepaid million principal amount of borrowings under those facilities with the proceeds of an offering of principal amount of its senior notes due and cash on hand 
in january  paetec obtained million of additional term loans under an incremental facility extended pursuant to its existing credit facilities agreement and applied a portion of the borrowings under that facility toward the redemption of all of mcleodusa s outstanding senior secured notes in connection with paetec s acquisition of mcleodusa 
trends affecting our business the telecommunications industry has remained highly competitive in an environment marked by overcapacity in some sectors and increased deregulation 
market forces and changes in government regulations have required  and may continue to require  us to reduce rates for some of the services we provide 
these trends may reduce our historical rate of revenue growth and continue to exert pressure on our operating margins 
we believe  however  that these reduced rates have been and in will continue to be offset by increased sales volume 
in addition  we believe that the relatively long term nature of our agreements with customers of our network services  which have an average initial term of three years  should reduce the likelihood that we will experience significant  rapid decreases in the rates we charge for our services 
wireless substitution 
as telecommunications customers increasingly use wireless forms of communication  such as hand held internet access devices and cell phones  the volume of traffic carried by traditional wireline telecommunications networks has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
although we believe this trend is most pronounced in the residential marketplace  wireless substitution also has had an adverse effect on the wireline usage patterns of the medium sized and large businesses and institutions we target 
we believe wireless substitution has led to a decrease in the average minutes of use generated by our customers 
to date  we have been able to offset this loss of revenue from existing customers through sales of services to new customers 
we believe that the transition to wireless based forms of communication will continue in the foreseeable future 
we attempt to respond to this trend by offering service levels and product packages that are not currently available using wireless alternatives 
converged voice and data traffic 
voice and data traffic historically have traveled over telecommunications networks using incompatible transmission formats 
this means that a telecommunications transmission circuit had to be designated to carry either data traffic or voice traffic 
as a result  excess capacity on a voice circuit could not be made available to reduce demand on a data circuit 
new technologies that allow voice and data traffic to travel interchangeably over the same network  commonly known as voice over internet protocols  or voip  technology  enables more efficient use of the telecommunications networks 
because we lease the majority of our transmission capacity  this increased efficiency has the potential to reduce significantly 
table of contents our cost of providing services to our customers 
in the coming years  we plan to continue installing equipment and transition our network to take full advantage of these new technologies 
service disruptions may accompany the transition to a new technology  which could adversely affect our revenues 
financial difficulties faced by many competitive communications carriers 
over the last five years  many competitive communications services providers have experienced financial difficulties 
these difficulties have led to the general perception that our industry is marred by instability and financial weakness 
this perception makes it harder for us to gain new customers  raise additional capital and negotiate with our vendors 
we have addressed this perception by maintaining cash balances that are generally in excess of our current needs and by limiting our growth activities so that we do not impair our short term cash flow 
industry consolidation 
our industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation in recent periods 
these transactions have created more significant competitors for paetec and have reduced the number of vendors from which paetec may purchase network elements it requires to operate its business 
we expect this trend to continue in the near future 
to compete more effectively in our industry  we plan to pursue our own acquisition strategy to increase our operating leverage  achieve economies of scale and broaden our name recognition 
revenue paetec derives revenue from sales of its network services  carrier services and integrated solutions services 
paetec derives most of its revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees that are generated principally by sales of its network services 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
monthly recurring fees are paid by paetec s end user customers and are billed in advance 
usage based fees consist of fees paid by paetec s network services customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when paetec terminates local calls made by their customers  and access fees paid by other carriers for long distance calls paetec originates or terminates for the other carrier 
the monthly recurring fees and usage based fees generated by sales of paetec s network services and carrier services to any customer tend to be relatively consistent from month to month  subject to changes in the calling patterns of the customer s business 
these fees generally are based on the number of digital t transmission lines used by the customer 
because paetec believes that the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines in service provides accurate information with respect to its future revenue  the company uses data with respect to the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines paetec has in service from period to period to assist it in evaluating revenue trends related to its network services and carrier services businesses 
network services 
paetec delivers integrated communications services  including local services  long distance services and data and internet services  to end users on a retail basis  which the company refers to as its network services 
revenue from network services represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for and paetec s network services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based fees 
in addition to usage based fees invoiced directly to the end user customers  usage based fees for paetec s network services also include the interstate and intrastate access fees the company receives from other communications providers when it originates or terminates long distance calls for those other providers to or from paetec s network services customers  and the reciprocal compensation fees paetec receives from some other local carriers when it terminates local calls made by the customers of the other local carriers 
paetec recognizes revenue during the period in which the revenue is earned 
paetec s network services also generate non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues  which it receives upon initiation of service 
paetec defers recognition of these revenues and amortizes them over the average contractual life  primarily three years 

table of contents carrier services 
paetec generates revenue from wholesale sales of communications services to other communications businesses  which the company refers to as its carrier services 
revenue from carrier services represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for and paetec s carrier services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based fees 
usage based fees for paetec s carrier services consist primarily of the interstate and intrastate access fees the company receives from other communications providers when it originates or terminates long distance calls for those other providers to or from paetec s carrier services customers  and the reciprocal compensation fees paetec receives from some other local carriers when it terminates to its carrier services customers local calls made by customers of other local carriers 
access fee and reciprocal compensation revenue generated by network services and carrier services 
paetec generates access fees when paetec s switching facilities provide a connection between a long distance carrier and an end user 
in accordance with a may fcc order  paetec has designed its interstate access rates to equal the interstate access rates charged by the competing incumbent carrier for functionally equivalent access services  including all applicable fixed and traffic sensitive charges 
in the may order  the fcc announced a new rule that limits the interstate access fees competitive carriers like paetec are able to collect from a long distance carrier in situations where the competitive carriers do not provide service directly to the end user 
this rule specifically targeted traffic that competitive carriers handle for wireless carriers and provided that competitive carriers could charge no more than incumbent carriers for these services 
state regulatory commissions historically have regulated the intrastate access rates imposed by incumbent carriers  but many states had subjected the intrastate access rates of competitive carriers to significantly less regulation 
there are some states in paetec s existing geographic markets that currently require a competitive carrier to mirror the intrastate access rates of the incumbent carrier in that state  and california and virginia recently adopted requirements requiring competitive carriers to step down their intrastate access rates over a limited period 
other state regulatory commissions have begun proceedings to investigate intrastate access rates of competitive carriers  and those ongoing proceedings may result in a change to the rates paetec assesses long distance carriers for use of the company s in state networks 
both the fcc and state regulatory commissions continue to review rules regarding the compensation local carriers pay to other local carriers for termination of local telephone calls as reciprocal compensation 
rates and terms for reciprocal compensation are based on agreements between paetec and other local carriers and are supported by federal and state regulatory and judicial rulings 
the company is engaged in continuing discussions with large incumbent carriers  among others  to perpetuate its contractual arrangements for reciprocal compensation in relevant service territories 
paetec has agreements in place with an increasing number of other local providers  including qwest in its region  that require such termination services to be provided on a bill and keep basis in which neither carrier compensates the other for local calls 
reciprocal compensation constituted of total revenue for and of total revenue for and most of paetec s reciprocal compensation for these periods was generated by paetec s carrier services 
all forms of intercarrier compensation  including exchange access and reciprocal compensation  are now the subject of a generic proceeding at the fcc designed to reform the way carriers and providers pay other carriers and providers for use of their respective networks 
a filing at the fcc  known as the missoula plan  was anticipated to be the blueprint for nationwide intercarrier compensation reform  but its fate remains uncertain 
if implemented  such a plan could have a substantial effect on paetec s access revenues  network capital expenditures and cost of sales 
instead of adopting a broad  all encompassing plan such as missoula  the fcc is considering proposals that address limited pieces of the intercarrier compensation regime 
recent proposals address phantom traffic  which refers to unidentifiable  and thus unbillable  network traffic 
a proposal submitted in would require every originating carrier to identify in its signaling information the calling party s telephone number and every intermediate carrier to transmit that information in its signaling without alteration so that the appropriate form and level of intercarrier compensation can be calculated and assessed 
the 
table of contents proposal also would require that in the absence of a mutual agreement between carriers to the contrary  most calls would be classified for purposes of intercarrier compensation based on the area code and exchange prefix of the calling and called parties 
this proposal  if adopted  could result in the application of terminating interstate switched access charges on voip traffic originated on a broadband connection  which could significantly increase the cost of providing certain ip based services 
paetec is currently evaluating the plan to assess its potential effect on the company 
any future mandated decreases in the company s access rates  or the determination that local exchange carriers may assess charges on broadband originated traffic  could further adversely affect the company s gross margins and operating cash flow with respect to its carrier services 
total access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation attributable to both network services and carrier services customers represented approximately of total revenue for  of total revenue for  and of total revenue for access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation  as a percentage of carrier services revenue  decreased to in from in and in access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation accounted for of network services revenue in each of  and the decreasing contribution of access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation to paetec s operating results over this three year period was principally due to a shift in product mix 
integrated solutions 
paetec derives revenue from sales to retail end user customers of telecommunications equipment and software and related services 
revenue from these integrated solutions represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for and a portion of paetec s integrated solutions revenue consists of fees its customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes revenue for equipment sales and system design and installation services upon delivery and acceptance of the underlying equipment 
paetec derives an additional component of its integrated solutions revenue through selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery of the software 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for training the end user in the proper use of paetec s telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees on a pro rata basis over the length of the underlying maintenance contract 
paetec recognizes training fees after it fulfills the training obligation 
cost of sales paetec provides its network services and carrier services by using electronic network components that it owns and telephone and data transmission lines that it leases from other telecommunications carriers 
paetec s cost of sales for these services consists primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
paetec s leased transport charges are the payments it makes to lease the telephone and data transmission lines that the company uses to connect its customers to its network and to connect its network to the networks of other carriers 
usage costs for local and long distance are the costs that paetec incurs for calls made by its customers 
cost of sales for paetec s integrated solutions also includes the costs it incurs in designing systems and purchasing and installing equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses paetec s selling  general and administrative expenses include selling and marketing  customer service  billing  corporate administration  engineering personnel and other personnel costs 
as paetec continues to expand its business  paetec expects that it will incur increased selling and marketing costs  which primarily reflect salaries of the company s direct sales force and commissions paid to its direct sales force and sales agents 

table of contents withdrawn initial public offering and related terminated senior secured credit facility expenses on september   paetec withdrew its registration statement filed with the sec on april  related to a proposed initial public offering of common stock 
as a result  paetec wrote off approximately million of costs related to the withdrawn initial public offering and associated withdrawn new senior secured credit facility during leveraged recapitalization related costs on june   paetec completed a leveraged recapitalization to eliminate all outstanding shares of its series a convertible redeemable preferred stock before the optional redemption rights of the holders of those shares became effective in february  as well as the associated approval rights of the holders of those shares and the additional approval rights of the former stockholders of campuslink communications systems  inc among other recapitalization transactions  paetec repurchased all outstanding shares of its series a convertible redeemable preferred stock and specified outstanding shares of its class a common stock for a purchase price payable in cash 
paetec funded the purchase price in part with proceeds of borrowings under new senior secured credit facilities 
immediately before the series a preferred stock repurchase  specified shares of the series a preferred stock were converted into class a common stock in accordance with the existing terms of the series a preferred stock 
in addition  as part of the leveraged recapitalization  holders of paetec s class b common stock agreed to convert all of the outstanding shares of class b common stock into an equal number of shares of class a common stock and a right to receive a total of  additional shares of class a common stock in connection with the conversion 
the leveraged recapitalization also included paetec s cash repurchase of specified options to purchase class a common stock issued in connection with paetec s acquisition by merger of campuslink communications 
to induce specified initial stockholders of paetec to provide the consents  approvals  waivers  releases and other agreements necessary to complete the other leveraged recapitalization transactions  paetec issued and sold  shares of class a common stock for no additional consideration to these initial stockholders 
paetec used the proceeds from the new senior secured credit facilities  in part  to pay some or all of the total cash required to complete the leveraged recapitalization transactions and to pay off or refinance substantially all of the company s then existing debt  including its then existing senior secured credit facility and capital leases 
paetec s board of directors approved the grant of equity based and cash incentive awards to some senior executives for services in connection with the leveraged recapitalization and to promote the retention of the executives following the completion of the leveraged recapitalization 
these awards included total cash bonuses of million and grants of restricted stock units for  shares of class a common stock  which vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant 
the cash bonuses were paid upon completion of the leveraged recapitalization and were subject to specified repayment provisions that could have resulted in an executive s repayment of some or all of the bonus upon the occurrence of specified events during the full calendar months following the month in which the bonuses were paid 
in august  paetec entered into agreements with each executive who had received one of these cash bonuses  under which paetec agreed to terminate the repayment provisions to which the bonuses were originally subject 
these termination agreements were entered into to induce the executives to take actions or enter into or consent to agreements related to the execution of the merger agreement  including amendments to severance agreements and consents to incentive plan amendments that would preclude the completion of the mergers from triggering potential accelerated payments or accelerated vesting of equity awards held by the executives 
as a result of these cash bonus transactions  paetec recorded a charge of million  which is included in income from operations for series a repurchase as part of the leveraged recapitalization  the series a preferred stockholders converted  outstanding shares of series a preferred stock into  shares of class a common stock immediately before paetec s repurchase of the remaining  outstanding shares of series a preferred stock  including accrued

the fair value of these shares of class a common stock at june  of million was recorded as an inducement expense and included in leveraged recapitalization related costs in paetec s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for fair value of common stock paetec determined the illiquid  non marketable fair value of its class a common stock as of june  based upon its capitalization structure after the leveraged recapitalization using the class a common stock price negotiated as part of the leveraged recapitalization 
paetec assessed the reasonableness of this price by performing an internal valuation analysis similar to the periodic analysis applied to determine the fair value of the class a common stock from time to time in connection with granting stock options to employees 
this analysis used paetec s projected future cash flows  discounted at a rate that reflects both paetec s weighted average cost of capital and the lack of liquidity of the class a common stock  and an implied market value analysis based on the stock price performance of comparable public peers within the competitive carrier industry 
based on this analysis  paetec determined that the illiquid  non marketable fair value of the class a common stock was equal to per share on june  paetec determined the liquid  marketable fair value of the class a common stock at june  based upon its capitalization structure immediately before the leveraged recapitalization  using the class a common stock price negotiated as part of the leveraged recapitalization 
paetec assessed the reasonableness of this price by performing an internal valuation analysis similar to the periodic analysis applied to determine the fair value of the class a common stock from time to time in connection with granting stock options to employees 
however  this analysis used paetec s projected future cash flows  discounted at a rate that reflects paetec s weighted average cost of capital  and did not include a discount for the lack of liquidity of the class a common stock  and an implied market value analysis based on the stock price performance of comparable public peers within the competitive carrier industry 
based on this analysis  paetec determined that the liquid  marketable fair value of the class a common stock based upon its capitalization structure immediately before the leveraged recapitalization was per share

table of contents adjusted ebitda presentation adjusted ebitda  as defined by paetec for the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis   represents net income loss before interest expense  provision for benefit from income taxes  depreciation and amortization  change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right  stock based compensation  leveraged recapitalization costs  integration and restructuring costs  and loss on extinguishment of debt 
paetec s adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used by paetec s management  together with financial measurements prepared in accordance with gaap such as revenue and cash flows from operations  to assess paetec s historical and prospective operating performance 
management believes that trends in paetec s adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of paetec s ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
management uses adjusted ebitda to enhance its understanding of paetec s core operating performance  which represents management s views concerning paetec s performance in the ordinary  ongoing and customary course of its operations 
paetec s calculation of adjusted ebitda excludes the following costs  none of which management views as expenses relevant to its assessment of paetec s core operating performance integration and restructuring costs paetec incurred in connection with the us lec merger  costs paetec incurred in connection with the leveraged recapitalization it completed in june  including change in fair market value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion rights  leveraged recapitalization related costs and loss on extinguishment of debt  and stock based compensation expense 
paetec s management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate paetec s performance relative to that of its competitors 
this financial measure permits a comparative assessment of paetec s operating performance  relative to the company s performance based on its gaap results  while isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is a particularly useful comparative measure within paetec s industry 
the communications industry has experienced recent trends of increased merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings 
these activities have led to significant non operating charges to earnings  such as those resulting from debt restructurings  and to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies 
adjusted ebitda facilitates company to company comparisons in the communications industry by eliminating some of the foregoing variations 
paetec provides information relating to its adjusted ebitda so that analysts  investors and other interested persons have the same data that management uses to assess paetec s core operating performance 
management believes that providing this information permits the foregoing persons to obtain a better understanding of paetec s core operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance on a standalone and a comparative basis 
paetec s adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
in addition  adjusted ebitda has other limitations as an analytical financial measure 
these limitations include the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect paetec s capital expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment  
table of contents adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  associated with paetec s indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that paetec s management considers not indicative of paetec s ongoing operations  and to the extent that paetec changes its accounting of certain transactions or other items from period to period  paetec s adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable from period to period 
paetec s management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on paetec s gaap results to evaluate its operating performance and by considering independently the economic effects of the foregoing items that are or are not reflected in adjusted ebitda 
as a result of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as a measure of operating performance  nor should it be considered as an alternative to cash flows  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as a measure of liquidity

table of contents revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to  million for from million for the increase in total revenue was substantially attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results for excluding us lec s results  total revenue increased million  or  over revenue from network services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from carrier services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from integrated solutions increased million  or  to million for from million for excluding us lec s results for  revenue from network services increased million  or  over  revenue from carrier services increased million  or  over  and revenue from integrated solutions increased million  or  over of total revenue for  revenue from network services  carrier services and integrated solutions accounted for  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  of total revenue for excluding us lec s results  network services  carrier services and integrated solutions contributed  and  respectively  of total revenue for the increases in total revenue and revenue generated by network services and carrier services primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service from  lines as of december  to  lines as of december  us lec accounted for  of the lines in service as of december  our integrated solutions business has a longer revenue cycle and may produce irregular trends on a quarterly basis 
total access revenue represented of total revenue for  or excluding us lec s results  and of total revenue for reciprocal compensation constituted of total revenue for  or excluding us lec s results  and of total revenue for most of paetec s access fees and reciprocal compensation for these periods was generated by its carrier services 
access revenue and reciprocal compensation constituted of the total carrier services revenue for  which represented a decrease from of total carrier services revenue for excluding us lec s results  access revenue and reciprocal compensation accounted for of total revenue 
access revenue and reciprocal compensation  as a percentage of network services revenue  was for  or excluding us lec s results  and for the decrease in access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to a continuing shift in product mix toward services that do not generate as much or any access fee revenue or reciprocal compensation for paetec 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million for from million for  principally because of the inclusion of us lec s results in excluding us lec s results  cost of sales increased to million 
the higher cost of sales in principally reflected the increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service discussed above 
leased transport charges increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in leased transport charges was primarily attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results of million  or of us lec s portion of cost of sales  in the increase in leased transport charges for also resulted from increases in the amount of network services sold 
the increase in leased transport charges as a percentage of cost of sales was principally attributable to the shift in product mix referred to above  as well as the mix of leased transport charges to usage costs with respect to the customers acquired in connection with the us lec merger 
usage costs for local and long distance calls increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in usage costs was primarily attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results of million  or of us lec s portion of cost of sales  in the increase in usage costs for local and long distance calls for was also due to increases in the amount of network services and carrier services sold 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average usage 
table of contents rates paetec is charged by network providers 
the decrease in usage costs as a percentage of cost of sales was principally attributable to fluctuations in the mix of products sold during cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for to for the decrease was primarily attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results in and to the amount of voice and data services provided by paetec using its own network and facilities  as well as to network efficiencies which paetec achieved by aggregating network traffic using points of presence located near clusters of its customers 
paetec anticipates that the integration activities related to consolidation and integration of the paetec and us lec networks will continue to generate reductions in cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue  which may be offset by mcleodusa s cost of sales 
paetec expects to achieve such savings in cost of sales by increasing the use of switches and network assets and eliminating duplicative network costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of us lec  which contributed to an increase in salaries  wages  and benefits of million principally due to an increase in the total number of employees from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   to an increase of million in sales commissions related to increased total revenue  and to an increase in stock based compensation of approximately million related to stock based equity grants made during excluding the effect of stock based compensation  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for from for  primarily because the rate at which paetec increased its total revenue exceeded the rate at which it incurred increased compensation costs from hiring new employees 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under paetec s stock incentive plans 
paetec expects to recognize the expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
as of december   paetec had approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock unit awards  which it expects to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately years 
litigation settlement 
paetec s results for included a million litigation settlement charge for a ruling in favor of mci worldcom network services  inc  which had brought suit against paetec to recover previously disputed access charges 
the million litigation settlement charge reflected the incremental amount of the ruling not previously recorded 
integration and restructuring costs 
in connection with the us lec merger  paetec has incurred integration and restructuring costs 
paetec recognized approximately million of such costs in  most of which were incurred in connection with employee separations and lease termination agreements for duplicative facilities 
substantially all of the recognized amounts are expected to be paid by august depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense resulting from an increase of million in gross property and equipment since december   principally as a result of property and equipment paetec acquired in the us lec merger and as part of its network deployment and maintenance 
in addition  million of amortization expense recognized for related to the acquired fair value of us lec s customer relationships intangible asset with a weighted average useful life of eleven years 
future depreciation and amortization expense will change significantly as a result of paetec s acquisition of mcleodusa 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
for  paetec recognized a million loss on debt extinguishment  which represented the elimination of million of debt issuance costs related to the senior secured indebtedness refinanced in connection with the us lec merger and million of debt issuance costs 
table of contents as a result of the senior secured credit facility amendment entered into in connection with paetec s july offering of senior notes 
for  the leveraged recapitalization completed in june resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million  which was attributable to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the extinguishment of paetec s existing senior secured credit facility and to lease termination fees of million related to the termination of paetec s capital leases 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right 
the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right was eliminated as a result of paetec s leveraged recapitalization in june interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million for  primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances during as a result of merger related borrowings under paetec s senior secured credit facilities and paetec s issuance of million principal amount of senior notes 
paetec s average outstanding debt balances were million for compared to million for as of december   borrowing rates under the senior credit facility agreement and senior notes averaged 
as of december   borrowing rates were and under paetec s first and second lien credit agreements  respectively 
other income  net 
other income  net increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of an increase in dividend and interest income 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the tax years ended december  and includes a provision for federal and state taxes based on the annual effective tax rate applicable to paetec for these periods 
the difference between the statutory rate and paetec s effective tax rate for the tax year ended december  was primarily attributable to the effect of non deductible stock based compensation 
as of december   paetec had federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of approximately million  including approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards acquired as part of the us lec merger 
paetec has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of these loss carryforwards 
in general  section of the internal revenue code  or irc section  places annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses  and tax credit carryovers in existence at the time of an ownership change 
the entire balance of paetec s nols is subject to annual limitations under irc section if unused  the nols would expire on various dates from through although realization of such assets is not assured  paetec believes that it is more likely than not that it will be able to use the pre ownership change deferred tax assets related to the nols prior to their expiration 
in addition  paetec acquired approximately million of nols pursuant to its acquisition of allworx corp 
in october paetec has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of these loss carryforwards 
paetec is currently assessing its ability to utilize these nols when considering potential limitations under irc section and the final determination of purchase accounting 
a full valuation allowance is currently maintained against these acquired nols 
as a result of certain realization requirements of sfas r  the deferred tax assets relating to nol carryforwards above does not include certain deferred tax assets at december  that arose directly from or the use of which was postponed by tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting 
equity will be increased by approximately million if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized for federal income tax purposes 
paetec uses sfas  accounting for income taxes  ordering for purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been realized 
included in the net operating loss deferred tax asset above is approximately million of deferred tax asset attributable to state net operating losses 
approximately million of the deferred tax asset relates to net operating losses acquired pursuant to the us lec merger and paetec s acquisition of allworx corp 
paetec 
table of contents believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized prior to their expiration 
in recognition of this risk  paetec has provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
in july  the federal accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin among other things  fin provides guidance to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold  which income tax positions must achieve before being recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  fin requires expanded annual disclosures  including a rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months 
paetec adopted fin on january   and recorded a reduction of retained earnings of million effective january  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions at december  was million  the majority of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
net income 
net income increased by million  from net income of million for to net income of million for compared with revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from network services increased million  or  to for from million for revenue from carrier services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from integrated solutions increased million  or  to million for from million for the increases in total revenue and revenue generated by network services and carrier services primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service  from  lines as of december  to  lines as of december  of the lines in service as of december   approximately were attributable to paetec s network services business and approximately were attributable to its carrier services business 
in addition  paetec s acquisition of american long lines  inc in february accounted for approximately million of the increase in total revenue for the increase in revenue from integrated solutions was primarily due to new customer contracts signed during cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million for from million for in each period  cost of sales consisted primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
in  cost of sales also included a credit of approximately million from one of paetec s largest vendors for a network services discount based on cumulative purchases from june  through march   of which approximately million was based on purchases during and was included in cost of sales for paetec did not recognize approximately million of the credit over the discount period  because  before the recognition of the credit  the company did not believe that it would achieve the level of cumulative purchases required to earn the credit 
during  paetec entered into a new agreement with the vendor related to discounts on purchases of network services 
at that time  paetec reached an agreement with the vendor that it had satisfied the criteria to earn a credit under the prior agreement and that the amount of the credit was million 
cost of sales in also included the effects of a credit of million that paetec recognized from a litigation settlement 
leased transport charges increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in leased transport charges was primarily attributable to increases in the amount of network services paetec sold in usage costs for local and long distance calls increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in usage costs was primarily attributable to 
table of contents increases in the amount of network and carrier services paetec sold in  and was partially offset by a decrease in the average usage rates the company is charged by network providers 
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from for to for the increase was primarily attributable to paetec s investments in new products and a credit the company received from one of its largest suppliers during  as discussed above 
the increases were partially offset by the amount of voice and data services provided by paetec using its own network and facilities  and network efficiencies paetec achieved by aggregating network traffic using points of presence located near clusters of its customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries  wages and benefits of million  which was mainly due to a charge of million related to cash bonuses awarded to senior executives in connection with the june leveraged recapitalization and an increase in the total number of paetec employees from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  the increase was also attributable to an increase of million in sales commissions related to increased total revenue  an increase in stock based compensation of approximately million due to the adoption of sfas no 
r and the grant of restricted stock units to some executives in connection with the leveraged recapitalization in  an increase of approximately million in computer hardware maintenance costs related primarily to additional computer equipment in service  and an increase of million related to a judgment against paetec regarding disputed access charges 
as a result of the grant of restricted stock units to some executives in connection with the leveraged recapitalization and in connection with the us lec merger agreement  paetec is recognizing compensation expense related to these stock unit awards of approximately million over a weighted average period of years 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included million of costs related to paetec s withdrawn public offering and the related terminated new senior secured credit facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for from for primarily because the rate at which paetec increased its total revenue exceeded the rate at which it has hired new employees 
leveraged recapitalization related costs 
in  paetec s operating expenses included charges of approximately million for costs related to the leveraged recapitalization  including transaction costs of approximately million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased depreciation expense resulting from an increase of million in gross property and equipment since december  as part of paetec s network deployment and maintenance 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was offset in part as paetec ceased to record depreciation on some of its older equipment that had reached the end of its depreciable life 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right resulted in income of million for compared to an expense of million for after the end of the second quarter of  but before the issuance of its second quarter financial statements  paetec withdrew the registration statement that it had filed with the sec on april  for an initial public offering of common stock and ceased its effort to complete the offering 
before the second quarter of  paetec did not ascribe any value to the conversion right of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock  as the company believed it would be able to convert the preferred stock into common stock before the holders of the series a preferred stock would be able to require paetec to repurchase the series a preferred stock at fair value 
from the second quarter of through march   the embedded derivative was recorded at fair value  with any change in fair value recognized in current operations 
the fair value of the embedded derivative was determined based on a number of assumptions  including the liquidity and volatility of paetec s common stock 

table of contents as a result of paetec s repurchase of all outstanding series a preferred stock pursuant to the leveraged recapitalization  the series a preferred stock conversion right no longer exists 
the fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion right was as of june   as a result of the completion of the leveraged recapitalization 
the change in fair value from march  to june  was recorded as income in loss on extinguishment of debt 
as a result of the leveraged recapitalization  paetec incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million for  which was attributable to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the extinguishment of paetec s existing senior secured credit facility and lease termination fees of million related to the termination of its capital leases 
other income  net 
other income  net increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of an increase in interest income and an increase in other financing income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of higher average outstanding debt balances during  higher average interest rates  and the discontinuance of hedge accounting on paetec s interest rate swap agreements during  which decreased interest expense for that period by million 
the average outstanding balances on paetec s senior secured credit facilities were million for and million for as of december   borrowing rates were and under paetec s first and second lien credit agreements  respectively 
as of december   borrowing rates under paetec s senior credit facility agreement averaged 
income taxes 
paetec s effective income tax rate was for and for excluding the million charge in that resulted from the change in fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion right  paetec s effective tax rate would have been for of the million in charges related to the leveraged recapitalization  million related to the repurchase of paetec stock 
these costs are non deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the million of charges relating to the repurchase of stock and the million in income that resulted from the fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion right  paetec s effective income tax rate would have been for the increase in the company s effective rate from december  to december  was primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  and the corresponding million in stock based compensation expense relating to incentive stock options 
net income 
net income decreased by million from net income of million for to net income of million for the decrease was primarily attributable to the completion of the leveraged recapitalization in june critical accounting policies paetec s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require paetec to make estimates and assumptions 
of paetec s significant accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  paetec believes that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
paetec generates recurring operating revenue pursuant to contracts with paetec s customers and non recurring revenue pursuant to non recurring agreements 
paetec recognizes revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require satisfaction of the following four basic criteria before revenue can be recognized there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents paetec bases its determination of the third and fourth criteria above on the company s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee it has charged for the services rendered and products delivered  and the prospects that those fees will be collected 
if changes in conditions should cause it to determine that these criteria likely will not be met for some future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
management makes estimates of future customer credits through the analysis of historical trends and known events 
the provisions for revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction of revenue when incurred 
since any revenue allowances are recorded as an offset to revenue  any future increases or decreases in the allowances will positively or negatively affect revenue by the same amount 
network services and carrier services revenue 
paetec derives revenue primarily from its sale of communications services 
paetec s service revenue consists principally of usage fees and monthly recurring fees 
usage fees consist of fees paid by paetec s customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when the company terminates local calls made by their customers  and access fees paid by carriers for long distance calls that paetec originates and terminates 
paetec recognizes revenue related to usage fees when the service is provided 
paetec bills usage fees in arrears and uses estimates to recognize revenue for unbilled usage fees 
paetec s ability to generate reciprocal compensation revenue and access revenue is subject to numerous regulatory and legal proceedings 
until these proceedings are ultimately resolved  paetec s policy is to recognize reciprocal compensation and access revenue only when it concludes that its realization of that revenue is reasonably assured 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
monthly recurring fees are paid by paetec s end user customers and are billed in advance 
paetec recognizes this revenue during the period in which it is earned 
paetec has arrangements where it recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which requires some non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues that are payable in advance of the provision of services to be deferred over the average customer life 
in accordance with those guidelines  paetec defers service activation and installation fee revenues and related costs and amortizes them over the average customer life  which is primarily three years 
integrated solutions revenue 
paetec also derives revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment and software 
equipment revenue consists of fees paetec s customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes equipment revenue upon delivery and acceptance of the equipment 
paetec derives software revenue through selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery and acceptance of the software in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants and related interpretations 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for training the end user in the proper use of paetec s telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees pro rata over the length of the underlying maintenance contract 
paetec recognizes training fees after the training obligation has been fulfilled 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
to determine its allowance for bad debts  paetec uses estimates based on the company s historical collection experience  its assessment of current industry and economic trends  customer concentrations and its credit policies 
as of december   paetec had reserved for million of bad debts 
paetec has reserved for expected bad debt losses based on the factors referred to above  and believes that its reserves are adequate 
it is possible  however  that the sufficiency of paetec s estimates could become materially inadequate as the composition of paetec s receivables changes over time 
paetec continually reviews and refines the estimation process to take account of these changes  but from time to time the company may need to adjust its estimate to reflect actual experience 

table of contents cost of sales 
costs of sales are composed primarily of network costs  which are costs incurred for leased transport charges and for transmission of voice and data services over other carriers networks 
these costs consist of both fixed payments and variable amounts based on actual usage and negotiated or regulated contract rates 
paetec expenses network costs as incurred 
these costs include paetec s estimate of charges for which it has not yet received bills  and are based upon the estimated number of transmission lines and facilities paetec has in service and its estimated minutes of use based on internal reports 
once paetec receives an invoice from a carrier  the company begins a process of reconciling that carrier s invoice to paetec s internal reports 
once the reconciliation is complete  paetec follows contractual terms to dispute any erroneous billing and  ultimately  agrees with the carrier on the final amount due 
in some cases  this reconciliation process can take several months to complete 
paetec may make subsequent adjustments to its estimates after it receives bills for the actual costs it incurs  but paetec generally does not expect that these adjustments will be material to its operating results 
accordingly  paetec s accrual for network costs includes estimates for which the reconciliation of the carriers invoices to paetec s internal reports has not been completed 
because of the significance of access costs  the complexity of the systems that capture accrual information  and the quantity of negotiated and regulated rates  paetec believes that the estimation of network cost accruals is a critical accounting policy 
as of december  and  paetec had million and million  respectively  of disputed network invoices and approximately million and million  respectively  of recorded reserves related to disputed balances recorded in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets 
it is paetec s policy to review its long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant under performance of paetec s assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner in which paetec uses its assets or significant changes in paetec s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in fair market value of paetec s common stock for a sustained period 
paetec determines whether the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property and equipment  and finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the foregoing or other indicators of impairment 
paetec determines if impairment exists relating to long lived assets by comparing future undiscounted cash flows to the asset s carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  paetec measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in paetec s current business model or another appropriate valuation methodology for comparison to the carrying value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  paetec does not amortize goodwill or other acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
paetec has identified two reporting units as defined in sfas no 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually  based upon paetec s estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit 
as of december   paetec did not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
paetec assesses the carrying value of its goodwill during the third quarter of each fiscal year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill of a reporting unit will also be tested for impairment between annual tests if a triggering event occurs  as defined by sfas no 
 that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the annual assessment of the carrying value of paetec s goodwill undertaken with respect to  and indicated that the value of the remaining goodwill was not impaired as of july    and  respectively 

table of contents the changes in the carrying value of goodwill from january  through december  were as follows in thousands balance as of january  goodwill related to acquisition of american long lines  inc purchase accounting adjustment balance as of december  and december  goodwill related to the acquisition of us lec corp goodwill related to the acquisition of allworx corp balance as of december  paetec recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from allworx at their respective preliminary fair values as of the closing of the merger and did not reflect the preliminary purchase price allocations of acquired intangible assets and deferred income tax assets and liabilities acquired from allworx 
definitive allocations will be finalized based upon valuations and other studies that are being performed 
when the valuations are finalized  any changes to the preliminary valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed may result in material adjustments to goodwill 
paetec reduced goodwill by million during primarily as a result of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the acquisition of assets from covista communications  inc this decrease was partially offset by an increase in goodwill of million attributable to the company s acquisition of american long lines  inc because of the significance of long lived assets and the judgments and estimates that go into the impairment analysis  paetec believes that its policies regarding impairment of long lived assets are critical 
share based payment 
employees of paetec participate in various equity incentive plans 
officers of paetec also participate in the paetec corp 
executive incentive plan 
on january   paetec adopted sfas no

paetec adopted sfas no

under this transition method  stock based compensation expense is recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at january  using the same estimate of grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted on or after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
r 
paetec recognizes these compensation costs ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions regarding expected volatilities based on a volatility factor computed with the assistance of an independent third party  which considers an external peer group analysis of publicly traded companies based in the united states within a predetermined market capitalization range  which are referred to as public comparables 
the analysis provides historical and implied volatilities of the public comparables and develops an estimate of constant expected volatility for paetec 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as exercisability of the award  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the us treasury yield curve  and is based on the expected term of the option 
paetec uses historical data to estimate forfeitures 

table of contents the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and paetec uses different assumptions  its stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  paetec is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if paetec s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from the amount recorded by paetec in the current period 
before the adoption of sfas no 
r  paetec accounted for compensation cost under its option plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
and had adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
when appropriate  compensation expense was recorded for awards of options over the period earned 
in most cases  however  paetec had not recognized any compensation expense in connection with option awards to employees  since the exercise price of the option on the date of grant generally approximated the fair market value of the underlying class a common stock on that date 
income taxes 
paetec accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
the asset and liability approach underlying sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
management provides valuation allowances against the net deferred income tax asset for amounts that are not considered more likely than not to be realized 
paetec must make significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences when determining the amount of the valuation allowance 
paetec considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset 
paetec uses judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified 
purchase accounting 
paetec accounts for the purchase of a business by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets 
paetec uses available information to make these fair value determinations and  when necessary  engages an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
because of the inherent subjectivity associated with estimating the fair value of long lived assets  paetec believes that the recording of assets and liabilities acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of a business is a critical accounting policy 
derivatives 
sfas 
no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  allows the gains and losses of a derivative to offset related results on the hedged item in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  and requires paetec to formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
paetec s freestanding derivative instruments are designated as hedges at inception and evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly throughout the hedge period 
these derivatives are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 

table of contents paetec formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
paetec discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of a hedged item  the derivative or hedged item expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  or management determines that it is no longer appropriate to designate the derivative as a hedge instrument 
in connection with its senior secured credit facilities  paetec had interest rate swaps at december  and that qualified as cash flow hedges 
before their repurchase pursuant to the leveraged recapitalization in june  the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were convertible at any time at the holder s option into shares of the class a common stock at a price of per share of class a common stock 
at any time after february   but not after the completion of a qualified public offering or a specified sale of the company  any holder of the series a preferred stock would have had the right to require paetec to repurchase for cash any or all of the outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock at fair market value  as defined in the agreement pursuant to which the series a preferred stock was issued 
paetec determined that the conversion right of the series a preferred stockholders combined with the cash repurchase right of the series a preferred stockholders represented an embedded derivative as defined in sfas no 
paetec accordingly has valued and bifurcated the embedded derivative from the host contract 
at each balance sheet date  the embedded derivative was recorded at fair value  with any change in fair value recognized in current operations 
the fair value of the embedded derivative was determined based on a number of assumptions  including the liquidity and volatility of paetec s common stock 
as a result of the leveraged recapitalization  the fair value of the embedded derivative was reduced to as of june  legal and contingency reserves 
paetec accounts for legal and other contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met information before issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the foregoing list of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of paetec s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for paetec to judge their application 
there are also areas in which paetec s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
in addition to reviewing the foregoing list  paetec encourages you to review carefully the notes to its consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  where you will find a more comprehensive description of the company s accounting policies and additional disclosures that are required by generally accepted accounting principles

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk paetec is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business 
paetec manages the sensitivity of its results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of short term  interest bearing securities and by entering into long term debt obligations with appropriate pricing and terms 
paetec does not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity or other financial instruments for trading purposes  although the company holds some derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
paetec does not have any material foreign currency exposure 
paetec s major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates associated with borrowings the company used to fund the expansion of its business and to support its acquisition activities 
the interest rates that paetec is able to obtain on this debt financing depend on market conditions 
paetec s policy is to manage interest rates through a combination of fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate swap contracts to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
as of december   million of paetec s long term debt consisted of variable rate instruments that accrue interest at floating rates 
as of the same date  through three interest rate swap contracts  paetec had capped its interest rate exposure through june  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt  through june  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt  and through april  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to paetec s million of variable rate debt subject to an interest rate swap contract as of december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in the company s annual interest expense in the absence of the interest rate swap contracts
