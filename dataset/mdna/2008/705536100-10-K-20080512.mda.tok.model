the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
highlights as previously reported  we have experienced a downturn in revenue due to lower demand for our core technologies from year to year 
consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  a decline from the prior fiscal year and a decline from fiscal product licensing revenues decreased as a result of a decrease in block licensing revenue 
engineering services and maintenance revenues declined primarily due to downward price pressure arising from an increasingly competitive global workforce as well as substantial pressure on our oem customers to consolidate 
these overall decreases in revenues were primarily attributable to declines in the demand for our technologies  third party technologies we are licensed to sell and traditional engineering services 
recently  we have experienced a significant number of strategic changes in connection with our transition to a new business focus designed to address declining demand for our core imaging technologies from our traditional oem customer base on april   we consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain asset purchase agreement  dated as of january   between kmc and peerless  pursuant to which we sold substantially all of our ip to kmc  transferred to kmc thirty eight of our employees  licensed the ip back from kmc on a nonexclusive  worldwide  perpetual and royalty free basis subject to certain restrictions  entered into a sublease pursuant to which we are subleasing to a subsidiary of kmc  square feet of office space at our executive offices for a period of forty months at a monthly rent equal to the allocable portion of the rent and common charges payable by us under our lease for the property  and terminated substantially all of our existing agreements with kmc 
as consideration for the sale  kmc assumed certain of our liabilities  and paid us approximately million  less a holdback amount of million relating to potential indemnification obligations 
the cash proceeds generated from the kmc transaction will position us to continue executing our strategic plan 
on february   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with prism software corporation to acquire substantially all of the assets of prism  a provider of print and document management software products 
under the terms of the agreement we will pay prism million in cash  subject to adjustment as provided in the asset purchase agreement and will deposit into escrow either a  shares of our common stock  if the closing price of our stock is or less on the day before the closing date or b a lesser number of shares determined by dividing  by the closing price of the our common stock on the day before the closing date  if such closing price is or more 
the shares will be held in escrow to satisfy any potential indemnity claims until the later of a one year following the closing date or b the date the business acquired from prism first achieves cumulative net income in excess of  the asset purchase agreement also contains an earn out provision  under which prism may receive an additional payment in cash  stock or any combination thereof  at our option based on the total net income of the business acquired from prism over the first three years following closing 
completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions 
in january   we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cue imaging corporation  to investigate and explore potential opportunities in the aio market with new technologies 
year over year operating expenses were reduced by 
it is our intent to continue to manage our operating costs  selling  and general and administrative expenses as we move in a new direction 
the adobe license agreement is set to expire on june   and we do not expect that this agreement will be renewed 
the adobe license agreement provides that there is a period of twelve to eighteen months following the expiration of the agreement by which we continue to license and provide services to our existing oem customers 
our inability to implement our strategic plan  develop and offer products  and manage expansion in the aforementioned marketplaces  as well as the declining sales trend of our existing licenses  downward price pressure on our existing technologies  uncertainty surrounding third party license revenue sharing agreements  downward price pressure on oem products and the anticipated consolidation of the number of oems in the marketplace  may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

risk factors 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
table of contents assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we account for our software revenues in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past several years  we entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between us and the oem selling product utilizing our intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which we are an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees are probable 
under our accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period  in accordance with sop if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment  in accordance with sop for fees on multiple element arrangements  values are allocated among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  vsoe 
we generally establish vsoe based upon the price charged when the same elements are sold separately 
when vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  but not for the delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method as prescribed by statement of position if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements  all revenue for the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe does exist for the undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  unless the only undelivered element is a service in which revenue from the delivered element is recognized over the service period 
we recognize revenues for certain of our engineering services projects on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the estimates to complete the projects are determined by the individual project engineering manager responsible for the oversight of the individual projects 
the estimates are made at the end of each accounting period and are subject to unforeseen circumstances that can increase or decrease the hours necessary to complete the efforts 
for fiscal year  we reported no engineering services revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
we provide an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by us 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of our block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by our customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such adjustments have historically been within management s expectations 
however  product licensing cost increased by million during the third quarter of fiscal as a result of a change in estimate reported by one of our oem customers and decreased by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the settlement of differences arising from a third party licensing agreement review 
as of january   we had tax credit carry forwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately million which begin to expire in fiscal year the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income 
we have recorded a million dollar expected income tax benefit and have provided a valuation allowance for the remaining of our net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
with a change in management s assessment of the uncertainty  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of our customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
our recurring product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from our oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  we are required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of our quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event we are unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  we 
table of contents may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
on february   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior period results are not restated 
compensation cost recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but unvested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined in accordance with the original provision of sfas no 
using a black scholes option pricing model  and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r using a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of share based awards 
we use our actual stock trading history as a basis to calculate the expected volatility assumption to value stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on peerless practice of not paying dividends 
the risk free rate of return is based on the yield of us treasury strips with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date 
the expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation cost in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
upon adoption of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense from the multiple option ie accelerated approach to the single option ie straight line method 
compensation expense for share based awards granted through january  will continue to be subject to the accelerated multiple option method  while compensation expense for share based awards granted on or after february  will be recognized using a straight line  or single option method 
we recognize these compensation costs over the service period of the award  which is generally the options vesting term of four years 
we recorded  in share based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended january  share based compensation expense was allocated as follows for the twelve month period ended january   included in cost of sales   included in research and development expense   included in sales and marketing and  included in general and administrative expense 
we granted options to purchase  shares of common stock for the fiscal year ended january  on february   we adopted fin see item financial statements note income taxes for further information

net income net income for the twelve month period ended january   was million or per basic and per diluted share  compared to a net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share  in fiscal year  and a net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal year revenues consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of a decrease in the sale of block licenses 
the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily the result of the discontinuation of our everest controller product and other hardware sales which amounted to million in revenues in fiscal year and the cancellation of the pmc sierra contract 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  of which 
table of contents million was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the remaining million will be recognized in fiscal year this is compared with block licensing agreements of million signed in fiscal year  of which million was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the decrease in product licensing revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of a decrease in block licensing revenue resulting from a decline in the demand for our technologies and services 
engineering services and maintenance revenues generated by us were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease realized over the last two years was the result of increased competition for business on a global basis 
revenue generated by hardware sales was minimal in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the fiscal year decrease from the previous two years was the result of the discontinuance of the everest controller product 
contract and maintenance backlog at january  was approximately million  as compared with million at january   which did not include the amounts expected under the kmc agreement 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year product licensing costs were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease over the last two years was the result of lower levels of third party technologies in our product licensing revenues  due partially to a reduction of million in product licensing expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal this reduction arose from a settlement of differences arising from a third party licensing agreement review 
engineering services and maintenance cost of sales decreased to million in fiscal year compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year over fiscal year was due the reduced staffing in the engineering department 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the percentage increases in fiscal year and fiscal year were the result of the higher proportion of licensing revenues combined with a higher level of our intellectual property offsetting the lower gross margins attributable to engineering services and hardware sales and as previously mentioned reduction due to a settlement of differences arising from a third party licensing agreement review 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year research and development expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to a decrease in staffing 
the increase in fiscal year expenses compared to the previous fiscal year was the result of development efforts associated with the system on a chip soc networking and new color technologies 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decreases over the last two fiscal years were the result of a reduction in staffing levels and sales commission expense 
we continued to focus on the launch of new peerless imaging and networking technologies and on developing new oem customers  attending industry trade shows  and evaluating other opportunities to promote our core and new color imaging and network solutions 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the fiscal increase was due mainly to increased legal fees related to the kmc transaction  an r d tax study and a proxy contest during the year 
the fiscal increase was primarily due to a one time charge associated with our expense reduction program  a one time charge associated with the consultancy agreement with our former ceo  stock based compensation expense that has not been required to be recorded in the statement of operations in previous years  sarbanes oxley compliance expenses resulting from our classification as an accelerated filer during fiscal and non recurring legal fees associated with contractual matters related to agreements with some of our larger customers 
interest income  other income and expenses  and taxes interest income earned in all fiscal years was attributable to interest and investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents and investment balances 
the increase in fiscal year was a result of a higher level of investments 
on february   we adopted fin fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date 
if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained  then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
the tax benefit expected to be realized from deferred tax assets upon the consummation of the kmc transaction was primarily the result of research and development tax credits 
the provisions for income taxes for prior fiscal years were primarily the result of foreign income taxes paid 
these income taxes were paid through withholdings on payments of licensing revenues made by our customers to us 
we have provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on this consideration  we determined that it is more likely than not that million of certain deferred tax assets will be realized  primarily due to the projected gain on the sale of our ip to kmc 
accordingly  we reversed a portion of our valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at january  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations outstanding purchase orders total we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of  as of january   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note  income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents which  as of january   were million in the aggregate  compared to million at january  the increase was primarily the result of cash provided by operations of million and million in funds provided by stock options being exercised offset by cash used by investing activities in the amount of million 
compared to january   total assets at january  increased to million and stockholders equity increased to million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was compared to last year 
we generated million in cash provided by operations during the twelve month period ended january   as compared to million in cash provided by operations during the twelve month period ended january  our investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  used cash of million compared to million provided in fiscal year during fiscal year  million was provided by exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal year 
table of contents at january   net trade receivables were million higher than at january   due primarily to the timing of the signings and collections of new licensing agreements at the end of the fiscal years 
on april   we consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain asset purchase agreement  dated as of january   between kmc and peerless  pursuant to which we sold substantially all of our ip to kmc  transferred to kmc thirty eight of our employees  licensed the ip back from kmc on a nonexclusive  worldwide  perpetual and royalty free basis subject to certain restrictions  entered into a sublease pursuant to which we are subleasing to a subsidiary of kmc  square feet of office space at our executive offices for a period of forty months at a monthly rent equal to the allocable portion of the rent and common charges payable by us under our lease for the property  and terminated substantially all of our existing agreements with kmc 
as consideration for the sale  kmc assumed certain of our liabilities  and paid us approximately million  less a holdback amount of million relating to potential indemnification obligations 
the cash proceeds generated from the kmc transaction will position us to continue executing our strategic plan 
a certain portion of the net proceeds from the kmc transaction will be used for general corporate purposes  including satisfying our working capital needs and paying our remaining liabilities as they come due  relating to the assets that we retain following the consummation of this transaction  including our rights under our sublicenses with adobe systems incorporated and novell  inc and our customized intellectual property 
in addition to the net proceeds that we received from the kmc transaction  our operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses will significantly decrease  freeing up additional capital which will permit us to pursue our long term goal of providing high tech products and services to the worldwide digital content management market 
we intend to aggressively seek acquisitions and new ventures  leveraged by our current oem relationships  talent base and the infusion of capital resulting from this transaction 
our long term strategy includes diversifying our business to better ensure growth and profitability and maximizing our strengths in the following traditional core areas imaging  adobe postscript  networking and hardware intellectual property 
specifically  we plan to focus on the area of solution software applications and the aio market place 
we intend to acquire or invest in existing business enterprises to accomplish this goal 
while we have just begun to research and investigate potential strategic acquisitions  we have pending a planned purchase of substantially all of the assets of prism related to prism s print and document management software 
in addition  we have formed a wholly owned subsidiary to investigate and explore potential opportunities in the aio market with new technologies 
we have authorized a budget of million to initiate the subsidiary 
because this subsidiary is in the very early stages of market analysis  it has not yet entered into any agreements in the aio market and we can provide no assurances that it will do so or will ultimately be successful even if any such agreement is consummated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we do not hold any positions in equity securities of other publicly traded companies 
our exposure to interest rate risk in the past relates primarily to our non equity investment portfolio 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we  from time to time  maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  fixed rate debt instruments of the federal  state and local governments and high quality corporate issuers and short term investments in money market funds 
as of january   we did not hold any corporate debt securities 
although we are subject to interest rate risks in any future investments in these types of securities  we believe an effective increase or decrease of in interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on our results from operations 
consequently  we believe our interest rate risk is minimal 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
currently all of our contracts  including those involving foreign entities  are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date  and have no intention of doing so
