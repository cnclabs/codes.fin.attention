item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data 
see also forward looking statements on page overview marine products  through our wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
our sales and profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products to retail customers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
most of these dealers finance their inventory through third party floorplan lenders  who pay marine products upon delivery of the products to the dealers 
we manage our company by focusing on the execution of the following business and financial strategies manufacturing high quality  stylish  and innovative powerboats for our dealers and retail customers  providing our independent dealer network appropriate incentives  training  and other support to enhance their success and their customers satisfaction  thereby facilitating their continued relationship with us  managing our production and dealer order backlog to maximize profitability and reduce risk in the event of a downturn in sales of our products  maintaining a flexible  variable cost structure which can be reduced quickly when deemed appropriate  focusing on the competitive nature of the boating business and designing our products and strategies in order to grow and maintain profitable market share  maximizing shareholder return by optimizing the balance of cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to shareholders  and the repurchase of its common stock on the open market  aligning the interests of our management and shareholders 
in implementing these strategies and attempting to optimize our financial returns  management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories  the production mix of its various models  and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence  interest rates  dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences  and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial and other data  including our market share  unit sales of our products  average selling price per boat  and gross profit margins  among others  as indicators of the success of our strategies 
marine products financial results are affected by consumer confidence because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure  interest rates because many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats  and other socioeconomic and environmental factors such as availability of leisure time  consumer preferences  demographics and the weather 
during  the industry continued the trend of lower wholesale and retail sales that began in the fourth quarter of high fuel prices and the problems in the residential mortgage market which came to light in continue to impact both consumer confidence as a whole  as well as consumer spending decisions in popular boating areas such as florida and southern california 
these industry conditions were reflected in our production levels  which were lower than in in order to maintain appropriate dealer inventories and backlog 
we monitor our market share in the to foot sterndrive category as one indicator of the success of our strategies and the market s acceptance of our products 
for the nine months ended september  latest data available to us  chaparral s market share in the to foot sterndrive category was percent  a decline from our market share in the same category for the twelve months ended december  of percent 
this decline was concentrated in the smaller to foot size boats in our market 
we believe this was the result of two factors the execution of our stated strategy of selling larger  more profitable boats  and the strategy of certain of our competitors  who have built and sold a large number of entry level smaller boats which are constructed in offshore manufacturing plants with lower cost labor 
although we will continue to monitor our market share and believe it to be important  we also believe that maximizing profitability takes precedence over growing our market share 
outlook management believes that realizing growth in net sales and profits in will continue to be a challenge 
this belief is based on attendance levels and sales during the first part of the winter boat show season compared to the same period in  as well as dealer inventories and backlog as of the end of in addition  management believes that consumers are concerned about high fuel prices and a possible slowing economy 
also  the prolonged drought in several of marine products major southeastern markets has reduced or eliminated recreational boaters access to docks and boat ramps  and has made certain waterways unusable 
boat show attendance has historically been positively correlated with retail boat sales later in the selling season because consumers attend shows due to their interest in recreational boating and make initial purchasing decisions at a boat show exhibition 
however  there can be no assurance that this relationship will continue in or subsequent years 
pleasure boating is a discretionary consumer activity  and can be negatively impacted by many factors  therefore  an increase in interest rates  continued high fuel costs  or further declines in consumer confidence could have an additional negative impact on net sales and profits 
over the past several years  marine products as well as other manufacturers have been improving their customer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
in addition  the recreational boating industry has started a promotional program which involves advertising and consumer targeting efforts  as well as other activities designed to increase the potential consumer market for pleasure boats 
many manufacturers  including marine products  are participating in this program 
management believes that these efforts will benefit the industry and marine products 
finally  marine products redesigned one of our chaparral product lines for the model year  and early indications are that the model is very popular with dealers and consumers 
the success of this product should continue to enhance marine products sales and profits in management believes that both the boating industry promotional advertising program and the company s new boat models will benefit marine products  but these efforts will also increase advertising expense and other selling  general and administrative expenses during our ability to maintain or improve our net sales and profits in will depend on a number of factors  including interest rates  fuel costs  consumer confidence  the continued acceptance of our new products in the recreational boating market  our ability to compete in the competitive pleasure boating industry  and the costs of certain of our raw materials

cash requirements management expects that capital expenditures during will be approximately million for enhancements to certain manufacturing plants 
we expect that no additional contributions to the defined benefit pension plan will be required in to achieve the company s funding objective 
based on the shares outstanding on december   the aggregate annual dividends to be paid at the dividend rate of per common share would be approximately million 
the company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to common stockholders  subject to the earnings and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors 
the company has an agreement with two employees  which provides for a monthly payment to each of the employees equal to percent of profits defined as pretax income before goodwill amortization and certain allocated corporate expenses 
the company has purchased a total of  shares in the open market as of december  on january  the board of directors authorized an additional  shares that the company can repurchase  increasing the number of shares available for repurchase to  the company believes that the liquidity provided by its existing cash and cash equivalents  overall capitalization and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating leases represent agreements for warehouse space and various office equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
off balance sheet arrangements to assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of its boats for inventory  the company has entered into agreements with various dealers and selected third party lenders to guarantee varying amounts of qualifying dealers debt obligations 
the company s obligation under these guarantees may become effective in the case of default by one or more dealers 
the agreements provide for the lender to return all repossessed boats in like new condition to the company  in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the dealers unpaid debt obligation on those boats 
the maximum contractual obligation and the amount outstanding under these agreements  which expire in  was million as of december  the company has recorded the estimated fair value of this guarantee  at december   this amount is immaterial and did not change from the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  a dealer defaulted on its debt obligation to a floor plan lender related to approximately million of boat inventory 
during  the company assisted the lender in coordinating the redistribution of these boats among existing and replacement dealers 
the ultimate cost to the company for these transactions and the impact on sales was not material 
related party transactions in conjunction with its spin off from rpc in  the company and rpc entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship after the spin off 
the transition support services agreement provides for rpc to provide certain services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products until the agreement is terminated by either party 
marine products reimbursed rpc for its estimated allocable share of administrative costs incurred for services rendered on behalf of marine products totaling  in   in and  in the company s liability to rpc for these services as of december  and was approximately  and  the company s directors are also directors of rpc and all of the executive officers with the exception of one are employees of both the company and rpc

the general terms provide for the indemnification for any tax detriment incurred by one party caused by the other party s action 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
sales recognition the company sells its boats through its network of independent dealers 
sales orders used to plan production are firm indications of interest from dealers and are cancelable at any time  although very few orders are cancelled after they have been placed 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales incentives and discounts the company records incentives as a reduction of sales 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of incentives that will be paid in the future on boats sold and accrues an estimated liability 
the company offers various incentives that promote sales to dealers  and to a lesser extent  retail customers 
these incentives are designed to encourage timely replenishment of dealer inventories after peak selling seasons  stabilize manufacturing volumes throughout the year  and improve production model mix 
the dealer incentive programs are a combination of annual volume commitment discounts  and additional discounts at time of invoice for those dealers who do not finance their inventory through specified floor plan financing agreements 
the annual dealer volume discounts are based on july through june model year purchases 
in addition  the company offers at various times other time specific or model specific incentives 
the retail incentive programs have historically been used during off peak selling seasons in addition to the winter boat exhibition shows 
the factors that complicate the calculation of the cost of these incentives are the ability to forecast sales of the company and individual dealers  the volume and timing of inventory financed by specific dealers  identification of which boats have been sold subject to an incentive  and the estimated lag time between sales and payment of incentives 
settlement of the incentives generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical incentive trends and makes adjustments to recorded liabilities for changes in trends and terms of incentive programs 
total incentives as a percentage of gross sales were percent in  percent in and percent in a percentage point change in incentives as a percentage of gross sales during would have increased or decreased net sales  gross margin and operating income by approximately million 
warranty costs the company records as part of selling  general and administrative expense an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred when sales are recognized 
the company evaluates its warranty obligation on a model year basis 
the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull  with warranty periods extending up to years 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are generally absorbed by the original component manufacturer 
warranty costs can vary depending upon the size and number of components in the boats sold  the pre sale warranty claims  and the desired level of customer service 
while we focus on high quality manufacturing programs and processes  including actively monitoring the quality of our component suppliers and managing the dealer and customer service warranty experience and reimbursements  our estimated warranty obligation is based upon the warranty terms and the company s enforcement of those terms over time  defects  repair costs  and the volume and mix of boat sales 
the estimate of warranty costs is regularly analyzed and is adjusted based on several factors including the actual claims that occur 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was percent in  percent for and percent in warranty expense as a percentage of net sales decreased in compared to because of unfavorable adjustments in  reflecting changes in estimated costs per claim due primarily to higher labor rates and parts costs 
a percentage point increase in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of net sales during would have increased selling  general and administrative expenses and reduced operating income by approximately million 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in the effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which the earnings and deductions are realized  and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  the effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company establishes a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period the determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed 
the company considers future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
the company calculates the current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which earnings or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates
