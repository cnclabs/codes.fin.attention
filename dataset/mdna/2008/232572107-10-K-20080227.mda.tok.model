item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we provide state of the art lithographic light sources designed to help enable the performance of leading edge wafer steppers and scanners built by our three lithography tool manufacturer customers  and provide field support products customized to support our chipmaker customers production use of these light sources in advanced wafer patterning applications 
we currently supply duv light sources to each of our lithography tool manufacturer customers  asml  canon  and nikon  who in turn supply their wafer steppers and scanners to chipmakers 
in addition  we sell replacement parts and services to our lithography tool manufacturer customers as well as directly to our chipmaker customers 
to provide optimally responsive service and support for our customers  we maintain field service and support offices in all countries in which they operate 
our light source systems currently constitute a substantial majority of all excimer light sources incorporated in lithography wafer stepper and scanner tools at chipmakers worldwide 
as the leading supplier of light sources  almost all consumer electronic devices manufactured in the last several years contain a semiconductor manufactured using our light sources 
since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our lithography tool manufacturer customers  we are subject to the volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry 
the semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical in nature and historically has experienced periodic ups and downs  some of them quite dramatic 
more recently  industry cycles appear to have become more muted  involving relatively short periods of moderate growth  followed by relatively short periods when revenue has either flattened or declined moderately 
in the most recent industry growth year   we achieved record revenue and net income levels 
although we initially expected to be another growth year for us  in late and early  some customers requested that we reschedule shipments of a number of light sources into subsequent quarters  which indicated a slowing trend in the industry 
as progressed  a number of chipmakers reduced capital equipment purchases in line with delays in their planned build outs of new fabs  and chipmaker capital spending remained cautious 
our product sales were higher in the second half of compared to the first half of the year which was due to the higher average selling prices that resulted from the strong product mix shift to our xl series light sources  particularly our most advanced xla and xla arf immersion light sources 
these higher revenue levels in the second half of were also due to an increase in replacement parts and service product revenue resulting from high light source utilization 
throughout  we achieved some major technology breakthroughs and all of our power scaling targets in our euv source development  including the achievement of w of burst power 
we strengthened our leadership position in this next generation technology  and in the third quarter of  entered into a multi year euv supply agreement with asml under which we received several purchase orders 
we currently plan to make our first euv source shipment in the fourth quarter of tcz  our joint venture with zeiss that is developing a production tool for the flat panel display industry  performed a number of successful customer demonstrations on its first generation production tool  the tcz x  in we currently anticipate that tcz will ship its first production tool in the first half of looking to the future  we see a challenging semiconductor industry environment in the near term  and opportunities for a return to growth in the mid to longer term 
regarding the business climate in early  concerns are high that a slow down in the us economy could have global consequences  especially on consumer purchases of electronics 
this in turn is reflected in the uncertainty of capital planning and buying activities at chipmakers 
in the memory sector  we believe the larger nand flash manufacturers will continue with their strategic buying plans to drive to smaller critical dimensions 
dram pricing is still weak  driving the largest manufacturers to convert their mm fabs to mm production 
logic should remain steady 
foundries  which have been under spending  may need to augment their leading edge capabilities with some immersion tools 
but in all sectors an economic slow down could result in the smaller  less financially healthy participants delaying or cutting portions of their capital spending 
in the first quarter of  ongoing demand for our leading edge tools will bias our product mix toward xla and xlr series light sources so that the average selling price of light source sales should remain at or above the fourth quarter level 
with duv lithography now the predominant technology for wafer processing  we anticipate continuing growth in our non systems revenue  as we support our customers drive to increase their utilization rates and productivity 
longer term  the overall thesis of the industry embracing advanced lithography technologies arf immersion  double patterning  and euv remains intact  driven by the needs to increase productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 
it is progressively more a question of when  not if  these lithography production techniques will be used 
the overall ongoing aggressive shrink of critical dimensions driving nm first production in the first half of  combined with capacity expansion at the nm production node  will drive growing customer demand for our xla and xlr series light sources 
to help enable our chipmaker customers to advance their product roadmaps on schedule  we began shipping the xlr i in the fourth quarter of demand for this light source has grown significantly  and we anticipate a strong production ramp for the xlr i throughout and continue to anticipate that it will become the light source of choice for nm production 
additionally  we have introduced the second generation in the xlr series  the xlr i  which offers w of output power and targets arf immersion double patterning applications at the nm production node 
some advanced memory manufacturers could reach the nm node by the end of our number one focus is on understanding our customers immediate and longer term requirements and enabling productivity and cost reduction enhancements for them through the development of more advanced light sources and technologies 
we will continue our numerous efforts to enhance the reliability and performance of our products for our customers and increase customer satisfaction  while pursuing our initiatives to enhance our operating efficiencies and improve financial performance 
however  macro economic factors  such as high energy prices and interest rates  a slower us housing market  and increased volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on consumer spending  including spending on electronic devices 
additionally  geopolitical turmoil can create a heightened sense of uncertainty that can also cause consumers to become more cautious in their spending 
either or both of these factors would have a negative effect on the demand for our products 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our ongoing internal processes  we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments associated with revenue recognition  inventory valuation  refurbished inventories  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  income taxes  allowances for bad debts  long lived assets valuation  intangible assets valuation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates and judgments upon historical information and other facts and assumptions that we believe to be valid and or reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions and facts form the basis for making judgments and estimates and for determining the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from our estimates if we were to use different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that revenue recognition  inventory valuation  refurbished inventories  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  and income taxes require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements than do other of our accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition our revenues consist of product sales  which primarily include sales of light source systems  replacement parts  and to a lesser extent  services  training  and refurbishments of our light source systems 
our revenues also consist of certain funded development activities performed for our customers and under government contracts and license agreements 
the sales of our light source systems generally include training and installation services 
we determined these elements qualify as one unit of accounting under emerging issues task force bulletin no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  as we do not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered training and installation elements 
furthermore  we determined that the undelivered training and installation elements are perfunctory performance obligations and are not essential to the functionality of our light source systems 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria are met for the light source system  and accrue the costs of providing the training and installation services 
we recognize light source system revenue at one of following three points  depending on the terms of our arrangement with our customer shipment of the light source system  delivery of the light source system or receipt of an acceptance certificate 
for the majority of our light source system sales  the shipping terms are fob shipping point and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
for our arrangements which include fob destination shipping terms  revenue is recognized upon delivery of the light source system to our customer 
lastly  one of our arrangements includes an acceptance provision  which is satisfied by the issuance of an acceptance certificate by the customer 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue upon receipt of the acceptance certificate 
in addition  we test our light source systems in environments similar to those used by our customers prior to shipment to ensure that they meet published specifications 
revenue from replacement parts sales is recognized at the point that legal title passes to the customer  which is generally upon shipment from our facility 
for a significant portion of our parts sales  our customers return the consumed assembly to us as part of the sale of the new part 
we reuse some of the material within these core assemblies  mainly metal components  for the future build of core assemblies 
as a result  our revenue consists of both cash and the value of the reusable parts received from our customers as consideration for these replacement part sales 
revenue associated with our customers return of core assemblies is recognized upon receipt of the returned core assembly 
the amount of the revenue is determined based upon the fair value of the reusable parts that we expect to yield from the returned core assembly based on historical experience 
service and training revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
for our service contracts  including onpulse  revenue is generally recognized straight line over the term of the contract or based on pulse usage 
to date  service and training revenue has been less than of our total revenue 
on a very limited basis  we refurbish light source systems owned by our customers to their original or new condition 
revenue from refurbished light source systems is recognized when the refurbishment process has been completed and  depending upon the customer  the proper delivery or acceptance terms have been met 
on a limited basis  certain of our product sales transactions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements in accordance with eitf a multiple element arrangement is a transaction which may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  or services  and performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
we allocate consideration to multiple element transactions based on the relative fair values of each separate element which we determine based on prices charged for such items when sold on a stand alone basis 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item s  we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
if there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  we account for the transaction as a single unit of accounting per the requirements of eitf our sales arrangements do not include general rights of return 
for funded development contracts  funds received are accounted for on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
revenues generated from these types of funded development contracts are included in other revenue  and are derived from cost sharing contracts between certain customers and us 
if milestones on these funded development contracts require that specific results be achieved or reported by us  revenue is not recognized until that milestone is completed 
deferred revenue represents payments received from our customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements as described above 
inventory valuation our inventories are carried at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out method  or market 
we evaluate the need to record adjustments for impairment of our inventory on a quarterly basis and our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods  spare parts and reusable parts that we use for our refurbishment activities 
obsolete inventory or inventory for which we either do not have expected usage for based on our forecasted demand for the next months or that we do not expect to have a high likelihood of use beyond months is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
when we perform our quarterly analysis of obsolete and excess inventory  we take into consideration certain assumptions related to market conditions and future demands for our products  including changes to product mix  new product introductions  and or product discontinuances  which may result in excess or obsolete inventory 
as part of this analysis  we also determine whether there are potential amounts owed to vendors as a result of cancelled or modified raw material orders 
we estimate and record a separate liability  which is included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets for such amounts owed 
the methodologies used to analyze excess and obsolete inventory and determine the value of our inventory are significantly affected by future demand and usage of our products 
there are many factors that could potentially affect the future demand or usage of our products  including the following overall condition of the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical in nature  rate at which our lithography tool manufacturers and chipmaker customers take delivery of our light source systems and our replacement parts  loss of any of our major customers or a significant change in demand from any of these customers  overall mix of light source system models or replacement parts and any changes to that mix required by our customers  utilization rates of our light sources at chipmakers  and engineering change orders 
based upon our experience  we believe that the estimates we use to calculate the value of our inventories are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual demand or the usage periods for our inventory are substantially different from our estimates  such differences may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
refurbished inventories as part of our regular business activities  we conduct significant parts refurbishment and material reclaim activities related to some of our core assemblies  particularly our chamber assemblies 
these activities involve arrangements with our customers where we sell a new part to the customer at a reduced sales price if the customer returns the consumed assembly that the new part replaces 
these returned core assemblies contain a certain amount of material  primarily metal components  that may be reused by us in the manufacture of future core assemblies 
upon receipt of these consumed core assemblies from our customers  we record an entry to recognize the estimated fair value of the reusable components either as revenue if the return of the core assembly relates to a spare part replacement sale or as a reduction in cost of product sales if the return of the core assembly is related to a part being replaced under our warranty or per the terms of an active service contract with our customer 
the value of the reusable parts contained within the consumed assembly is determined based upon historical data on the value of the reusable parts that we typically yield from a consumed assembly 
warranty obligations we maintain an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties associated with our product sales 
warranty costs include the replacement parts and labor costs to repair our products during the warranty periods 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a warranty provision  which is included in cost of product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the warranty coverage period and terms for light source systems and replacement parts varies by light source system model 
the warranty provision for our products is reviewed monthly and determined by using a statistical financial model  which takes into consideration actual historical expenses  product failure rates  and potential risks associated with our different products 
this model is then used to estimate future expenses related to warranty and the required warranty provision 
the risk levels and historical cost information and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated as these inputs change over the product s life cycle 
due to the highly technical nature of our light source system products  the newer model light sources and the modules contained within them have higher inherent warranty risks with their initial shipments and require higher warranty provisions until the technology becomes more mature 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures at customer sites 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex light sources 
although we classify these newly released light source models as having a higher risk in our warranty model resulting in higher warranty provisions  we are more likely to have differences between the estimated and actual warranty costs for these new products 
this is due to limited or no historical product performance data on which to base our future warranty costs 
warranty provisions for our older and more established light source models are more predictable as we have more historical information available on these products 
if actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures were to differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january  sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model and amortize the resulting expense over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options that we grant under our equity incentive plans 
in order to determine the fair value of stock option grants under the black scholes option pricing model  we must use subjective assumptions including the expected term of the stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the stock options 
sfas no 
r also requires that a forfeiture rate be estimated and included in the calculation of stock based compensation expense at the time that the stock option is granted and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates 
we use a combination of historical and implied volatility blended volatility to determine the expected stock volatility that we include in the black scholes option pricing model to value our stock options 
historical volatility is based on a period commensurate with the expected term of the options 
implied volatility is derived based on six month traded options of our common stock 
the expected term of our stock options represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding and is based on observed historical exercise patterns for our company which we believe are indicative of future exercise behavior 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on the historical activity for our company which we believe are indicative of future forfeiture rates 
if we change any of the key assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model as described above or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future or change our forfeiture rate  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially impact our operating results 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover our deferred tax assets 
if in the future we determine that a change has occurred which will not allow this recovery  we will record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this will result in a charge against our income tax provision 
the calculation of our effective tax rate is dependant upon the geographic composition of our world wide earnings  tax regulations governing each region and the availability of tax credits 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
we recognize these uncertainties based on the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the final payment of the amounts regarding these uncertainties may ultimately prove to be less than or greater than our estimate 
if this occurs there will be either a benefit or a charge to our income tax provision 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues product sales product sales related party other total revenues cost and expenses cost of product sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income other income expense net income before income tax provision and minority interest income tax provision minority interest net income gross margin on product sales years ended december  and revenues 
the types of revenue that we generate and how we recognize revenue for each is explained above under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenue in thousands  except units sold years ended december  vs 
increase decrease change light source systems revenue     units sold average selling price   replacement parts and service products product sales     other revenue  total revenue the calculation of average selling price excludes million of deferred light source system revenue in and includes million of deferred light source system revenue in product sales decreased in from the levels 
the decline in product sales was primarily due to lower light source system revenues  which was partially offset by continued growth in our replacement parts and service product revenues in as compared to the average selling price of our light source systems increased year over year due to a significant shift by our customers toward our most advanced  highest value added light sources for high volume immersion production applications 
the decrease in units of light source systems sold from to reflects the slowing conditions in the semiconductor industry and the reduced need for capacity expansion by our chipmaker customers 
our replacement parts and service products revenue increased in from the levels 
these higher revenues from period to period are due to the continued growth of the installed base of our products and the increased utilization of them by our chipmaker customers 
average utilization of our light sources by our customers increased from to  resulting in an increased demand for our replacement parts and service products 
revenues from funded development contracts which primarily include activities performed for our customers and under license agreements were  for compared to  for there were no revenues recorded or earned associated with our tcz joint venture in or we anticipate that our total revenue for the first quarter of will be lower than the fourth quarter levels primarily due to slowing industry conditions and the overall state of the economy 
our backlog includes only those orders for which we have received a completed purchase order from a customer  and that will be delivered to the customer within the following twelve months 
for the year ended december   our backlog totaled million and total bookings were million which yielded a book to bill ratio of compared to the year ended december   where our backlog was million and total bookings were million yielding a book to bill ratio of 
the increase in backlog from year to year primarily reflects the strong demand for our most advanced arf immersion products and their corresponding higher average selling prices 
the decline in bookings from to represents the slowing conditions of the semiconductor industry 
we installed light sources at chipmakers and other end users during the year ended december  as compared to light sources installed during the year ended december  sales to our three lithography tool manufacturing customers  asml  canon and nikon  amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for  and  and  respectively  of total revenue for our sales are generated primarily by shipments to customers in the united states  japan  korea and  to a lesser extent  other asian countries and europe 
approximately and of our sales in and  respectively were derived from customers outside the us we maintain a wholly owned japanese subsidiary  cymer japan  which sells to our japanese customers 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by cymer japan  accounted for and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the activities of cymer japan are limited to sales and service of products purchased by cymer japan from us as the parent corporation 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  license fees  manufacturing and service overhead  and foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts forward contracts associated with purchases of our products by cymer japan for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
shipping costs associated with our product sales are also included in cost of product sales 
we do not charge our customers for shipping fees 
the cost of product sales decreased from million for to million for this decrease in the cost of product sales was primarily due to a decline in light source system sales and decreased warranty costs in as compared to gross profit decreased from million for to for the gross margin on product sales was for compared to for this higher gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to increased factory yield and utilization  reduced product lead and cycle times  and reduced warranty costs which resulted from product reliability realization and favorable material reclaim productivity 
we anticipate that gross margin will be a couple of percentage points lower in the first quarter of compared to the levels as we expect that revenue from our lower margin replacement parts products will continue to become a larger percentage of our total revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs of internally funded projects as well as continuing product development support expenses  which consist primarily of employee and material costs  depreciation of equipment and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased from million for to million for due primarily to costs associated with our increased focus on euv light source development and the beginning stages of its commercialization and product development efforts associated with our tcz joint venture and the ltps technology 
in addition to our development of euv and ltps technologies  we also continued to focus on next generation arf products which include the ongoing development of our xlr series light sources 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased percentage points from for to for our investment in research and development will continue as we produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in the semiconductor industry 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase slightly in the first quarter of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include sales  marketing and customer support staff expenses and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million for to million for the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is primarily due to a million decline in compensation and benefits expense 
as a percentage of total revenues  such sales and marketing expenses decreased from for to for we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly in the first quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative personnel costs  professional services  including external audit fees  and administrative operating costs 
although general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at million for both and  the specific types of expenses that contributed to these totals varied from year to year 
general and administrative expenses related to stock compensation expense declined million from to due primarily to million in stock based compensation expense which we recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the correction of an error for a small number of stock options granted primarily in additionally  profit sharing and bonuses declined million from year to year 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in professional accounting service fees which were related to the implementation of fin and tax consulting support during the year 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from for to for we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in the first quarter of total other income net 
net other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio  interest expense incurred on our convertible subordinated notes and foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with fluctuations in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries against the us dollar 
total other income net decreased million from million in to million in a significant portion of this decrease from year to year is due to million in life insurance proceeds that we received and recorded to interest income following the death of one of our executive officers early in during  we also utilized a significant portion of our investment portfolio when we repurchased million of our common stock in our board approved stock repurchase program 
as a result of the utilization of a portion of our cash and investments for the stock repurchase program  we had a decrease in interest income in as compared to the decrease in interest and other income from year to year was offset by a  increase in foreign currency exchange gains and a  increase in interest and other expense primarily due to the expense related to the net present value calculations associated with our long term incentive bonus program 
income tax provision 
the tax provision of million and million for and reflects an annual effective rate of and  respectively 
the increase in the annual effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the extraterritorial income eti exclusion being replaced with a manufacturing activity deduction under internal revenue code irc section deduction 
the annual effective tax rate for was less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences such as research and development tax credits and the deduction and is a function of current tax law and the geographic location of pre tax income 
the annual effective tax rate for was approximately equal to the statutory rate of 
our future annual effective tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation and credits  particularly when and if the currently expired research and development tax credit will be extended  and the geographic compositions of our pre tax income 
years ended december  and product sales 
product sales increased from million for to million for the increase in product sales was due to higher light source system revenues and continued growth in replacement parts and service product revenues for compared to light source system revenues increased from million for to million for a total of light source systems were sold in at an average selling price of  compared to light source systems sold in at an average selling price of million 
on a foreign currency adjusted basis  the average selling price for was  compared to million for the slight increase in the average selling price of light source systems year over year reflects a shift in the product mix from capacity driven lower priced krf products in to higher priced technology buys of advanced arf products in the increase in quantities of light source systems sold from to reflects the slight slowdown of the industry in the beginning of compared to the upturn in the semiconductor industry in our chipmaker customers expanded capacity needs have impacted the demand for our light source systems  which  combined with our growing installed base of light source systems  has increased the demand for our replacement parts and service products 
the growth in replacement parts demand and rising tool utilization resulted in an increase in replacement parts and service revenues of from million for to million for replacement parts and service products revenue was also favorably impacted by the revenue recorded under a laser replacement agreement we entered into in revenues from funded development contracts were million for compared to  for there were no revenues recorded or earned associated with the tcz joint venture for sales to our three lithography tool manufacturing customers  asml  canon  and nikon  amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for  and  and  respectively  of total revenue for approximately of our sales for both and were derived from customers outside the us revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by cymer japan  accounted for and of total revenues for and  respectively 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales increased from million for to million for primarily due to higher light source system sales and sales of replacement parts and service products in compared to this increase in cost of product sales was partially offset by a decrease in warranty costs year over year 
this decrease in warranty costs in is primarily due to the proven extended lives of our consumable modules and efficiencies gained through an increase in the level of expertise and training of our field service engineers who perform warranty service on our light source systems and consumable and spare parts 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million for to million for the gross margin on product sales was for compared to for this higher gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to operating efficiency improvements  cost reductions  reduced lead and cycle times and reduced warranty costs which resulted from product reliability improvements which were made throughout the higher gross margin year over year was also caused by the overall increase in product sales in and the mix of those product sales being higher margin products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million for to million for due primarily to costs associated with our ltps product development efforts  euv light source development efforts and arf product development efforts for the design of an enhanced universal platform for our xl series light sources  and associated derivative products based on this platform 
research and development expenses were offset by amounts related to our externally funded research and development contracts of million and  for and  respectively 
in addition to our development of euv and ltps technologies  we also continued to focus on next generation arf and krf products 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased percentage points from for to for due primarily to revenues increasing at a faster rate than research and development expenses in as compared to sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for to million for this increase primarily reflects million in profit sharing and bonuses due to our improved financial performance in and million of stock based compensation expense associated with the sfas no 
r requirements which we adopted in january in addition  sales and marketing expenses were higher in compared to as a result of expenses associated with our tcz joint venture which was formed in july as a percentage of total revenues  such sales and marketing expenses decreased from for to for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for to million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation expense recorded in as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r on january  in addition to stock based compensation expense recorded as a result of sfas no 
r  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of related to a small number of stock options granted primarily in this additional stock based compensation expense resulted from us using the incorrect measurement date to calculate our compensation expense for those stock options 
additional increases in general and administrative expenses from to include million in profit sharing and bonus expenses and a million increase in external audit and advisory fees 
in addition  general and administrative expenses in reflect increased expenses associated with the tcz joint venture formed in july as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from for to for total other income net 
net other income was million and million for and  respectively 
this significant increase in net other income from year to year was primarily due to a significant increase in interest income  the receipt of million in life insurance proceeds following the death of one of our executive officers in the first quarter of  a decrease in interest expense and a foreign currency exchange gain recorded in as compared to a foreign currency exchange loss recorded in the increase in interest income reflects higher market interest rate yields on larger cash and investment balances which resulted from higher earnings and significant proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises during the decrease in interest expense from year to year was due to our lower debt balances as a result of the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes that we made in the second quarter of other income was positively impacted in by a million gain on debt extinguishment which resulted from the repurchase of these convertible subordinated notes 
foreign currency exchange losses totaled million  interest income and other income totaled million  interest expense totaled million and gain on debt extinguishment totaled million for  compared to a foreign currency exchange gain of million  interest and other income of million  and interest expense of million for income tax provision 
the tax provision of  and million for and  respectively  reflects an annual effective rate of and  respectively 
the change in the annual effective tax rate from year to year was primarily attributable to the significant increase in pre tax earnings  changes in the geographical distribution of income  a reduction in tax benefits from the eti  and the release of certain tax reserves in as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the annual effective tax rate for was less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences and tax credits and is a function of current tax law and geographic location of pre tax income 
the eti was repealed by the american jobs creation act of subject to certain transition rules 
the eti exclusion was replaced with a manufacturing activity deduction under irc section with a phase out of eti benefits in and our estimated eti benefit for reflects the transition rules 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from operations  proceeds from note offerings  and proceeds from stock option exercises 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  and million in working capital 
the slight increase in cash and cash equivalents in was primarily due to cash provided by operations and proceeds from investments which were almost completely offset by the repurchase of approximately million in shares of our common stock under our board approved stock repurchase program

at december   we had inventories of million compared to million at december  the million increase in inventory from period to period was primarily due to the increased production of replacement parts to support and provide service to our growing installed base of light sources 
accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily related to the increased inventory levels at the end of the million increase in deferred revenue from to primarily reflects prepayments received from asml during the third quarter of for purchase orders received from them under a multi year euv supply agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities during reflects significant net income for the year and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable is the result of higher revenues recorded during as compared to the increase in inventory balances for was primarily the result of an increased demand for replacement parts to support our growing installed base of light source systems  particularly our more advanced xla series systems and the increase in sales of our light source systems 
in addition  cash from operations was negatively impacted in as a result of classifying excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in the amount of million in financing activities in rather than operating activities in accordance with sfas no 
r which was adopted on january  net cash provided by operating activities during reflects net income for the year  significant decreases in accounts receivable and inventory and increases in accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects collections made in our receivable balances and a decrease in sales compared to the decrease in inventory reflects the reduction in our field and factory inventory as a result of our ongoing initiative during to improve asset management by reducing inventory and increasing inventory turns 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of proceeds from sold or matured investments  offset by purchases of investments and the acquisition of property and equipment used by us in the normal course of business 
some of the proceeds from sold and matured investments during the year were used to fund our stock repurchase program

we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories  including purchase orders with our vendors  accounts receivable  and for capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our manufacturing activity  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  expansion of sales and marketing and field service and support  competitive labor market compensation requirements  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the market acceptance of our products 
we believe that cash generated from operations along with the liquidity provided by our existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to sustain operations and provide for any potential future expansion of our business for at least the next months 
transactions with related parties we periodically sell our light source systems to zeiss and we purchase certain optical parts from zeiss 
zeiss is considered to be a related party as a result of its ownership interests in tcz  our joint venture entity

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value using generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures related to fair value measurements 
this statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
subsequent to the issuance of sfas no 
 the fasb has proposed a one year deferral for the implementation of the statement for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
this statement became effective for us on january  although sfas no 
increases the level of disclosures required for us for certain of our financial assets and liabilities  it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

we adopted all provisions of sfas no 
in december except for the provision which will require us to measure the funded status of our pension plans as of the date of our year end statement of financial position 
this provision will be effective for us for the fiscal year ending december  sfas no 
provides two approaches that a company can follow to transition to a fiscal year end measurement date 
we plan on utilizing the second approach which allows a company to continue using the measurements determined for the prior fiscal year end reporting to estimate the effects of the sfas no 
change at december  we do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this statement permits companies to choose to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in net income 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement became effective for us on january  based upon our analysis and implementation of sfas no 
as it relates to our balance sheet accounts  we have not elected the fair value option permitted in sfas no 
for any of our eligible financial assets or liabilities 
therefore  sfas no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces fasb statement no 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no 
r as of january  and are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statement amendments of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
the statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas no 
applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no 
as of january  and are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct business in several international currencies through our global operations 
due to the large volume of our business that we conduct in japan  the japanese operation poses our greatest foreign currency risk 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments  principally forward contracts  to manage our foreign currency risk exposure 
we enter into forward contracts in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations related to purchases of our inventories by cymer japan in us dollars for resale under firm third party sales commitments denominated in japanese yen  as well as other foreign currency exposures including exposures related to intercompany debt 
our objective is to offset gains or losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the forward contracts  thereby reducing volatility of our earnings 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward contracts to buy us million for billion yen and million for billion yen  respectively under foreign currency exchange facilities 
at december  the contract rates range from yen to yen per us dollar 
these contracts expire on various dates through may our forward contracts generally qualify for hedge accounting treatment per the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as a result  we defer changes in the fair value for the effective portion of these forward contract hedges and record the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
subsequently we reclassify the gain or loss to cost of product sales in the same period that the related sale is made to the third party 
the fair value of all of our forward contracts and the deferred gain or loss  net of tax  for those that qualify for hedge accounting treatment totaled  and  respectively as of december  and  and  respectively  as of december  the foreign currency exchange gain totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively and is included in total other income  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of these forward contracts as of december  would have fluctuated by million if the foreign currency exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar on these forward contracts had changed by 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in all countries in which we do business  and  when appropriate  use hedging transactions such as these forward contracts to minimize the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
although we enter into such forward contracts  they may not be adequate to eliminate the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage such foreign currency risks properly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
investment and debt risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  certificates of deposit  auction rate securities and commercial paper 
while it is our general intent to hold such securities until maturity  we will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
a change in market interest rates of would have impacted our net income from these investments by approximately  in in february  we issued million principal amount of unsecured fixed rate convertible subordinated notes due february  interest on these notes is payable on february and august of each year 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
because the interest rate is fixed  we believe there is no risk of increased interest expense 
to date  we have repurchased  at a discount to par  million of these notes reducing the principal amount outstanding to million at both december  and the fair value of such debt based on quoted market prices at december  and was million and million  respectively
