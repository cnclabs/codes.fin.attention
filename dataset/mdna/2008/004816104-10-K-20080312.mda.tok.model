critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting estimates are particularly important to the understanding of the company s financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the company s management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside the control of management 
the company s management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on historical operations  future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  the observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses the company s critical accounting policies and estimates 
estimates 
operating results may be affected by certain accounting estimates 
the most sensitive and significant accounting estimates in the financial statements relate to customer rebates  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  obsolete and slow moving inventories  potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  and accruals for income taxes 
accruals for customer rebates are based on executed contracts and anticipated sales levels  which are monitored monthly 
management critically evaluates the potential realization of deferred income tax benefits as well as the likely usefulness of inventories and the collectability of accounts receivable 
accruals for income taxes or benefits often require interpretations of complex tax rules and regulations  which may be subsequently challenged 
although the company s management has used available information to make judgments on the appropriate estimates to account for the above matters  there can be no assurance that future events will not significantly affect the estimated amounts related to these areas where estimates are required
