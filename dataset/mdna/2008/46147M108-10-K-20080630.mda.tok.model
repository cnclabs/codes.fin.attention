critical accounting policies in general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies detailed in footnote to the company s consolidated financials statements contained herein  those dealing with valuation of securities and other assets  revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable involve a particularly high degree of judgment and complexity 
our accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
therefor e  understanding these policies is important to understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
off balance sheet risk we execute securities transactions on behalf of our customers 
if either the customer or counter party fails to perform  we  by agreement with our clearing broker  may be required to discharge the obligations of the non performing party 
in such circumstances  we may sustain a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract value of the transaction 
we seek to control off balance sheet risk by monitoring the market value of securities held or given as collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
pursuant to such guidelines  our clearing firm requires that we reduce positions when necessary 
we also complete credit evaluations where there is thought to be credit risk 
page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
many factors are considered including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss  if any  in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee or representative of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be inco rrect and the actual costs upon disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserved amount 
risk management risk is an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
risk management is critical to the company s financial strength and profitability and requires robust auditing  constant communications  sound judgment and knowledge of financial trends and the economy as a whole 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  operational  regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk attributable to macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product  employment  inflation  interest rates  budget deficits and consumer sentiment 
consumer and producer sentiment is critical to our business 
the level of consumer confidence determines their willingness to spend  especially in the financial markets 
it is this willingness to spend in the financial markets that is key to our business 
a shift in spending in this area could negatively impact us 
however  senior management is constantly monitoring these economic trends in order to enhance and broaden our product line to mitigate potential negative impact of such trends 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
managing these risks is critical  especially in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volume 
failure to manage these risks could result in material financial loss to the company 
to mitigate these risks  the company had developed specific policies and procedures designed to identify and manage operational risk 
these policies and procedures are reviewed and updated on a continuing basis to ensure that this risk is minimized 
regulatory and legal risk regulatory and legal risk includes non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk of a large number of customer claims that could result in adverse judgments against the company 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which it operates  and we maintain a panoply of procedures to address issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
however  compliance procedures  no matter how stringent and comprehensive  can only limit  but not totally prevent  the institution of regulatory and legal proceedings  the outcomes and consequences of which cannot now be reasonably foreseen or quantified 
page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  effects of inflation the company s assets primarily are liquid in nature and not significantly affected by inflation 
management believes that the replacement cost of property and equipment will not materially affect operating results 
however  the rate of inflation can affect our expenses  including  without limitation  employee compensation and benefits  communications and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided 
key indicators of financial performance management periodically reviews and analyzes our financial performance across a number of measurable factors considered to be particularly useful in understanding and managing our business 
key metrics in this process include average production per representative  top line commission and advisory services revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  legal costs and earnings per share 
page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  results of operations percent of revenue year ended march  year ended march  percent change vs

our experience has been that upgrading the technical qualifications and business practices of our representatives not only generates more revenue  but assists in limiting the cost of overhead functions and representative errors and misconduct 
we strive to continually improve the overall quality of our force of representatives by recruiting high quality representatives  terminating low quality representatives  and assisting representatives to improve their skills and practices 
a key metric that we use to assess the average quality of our representatives is average revenue generated per representative 
average revenue per representative increased by  reflecting management s continued emphasis on recruiting and retaining established  productive representatives

growth in revenue from brokerage and advisory services continues to be complimented by expanding revenues from other commission sources such as mutual funds and variable annuities 
commissions commissions from variable annuities continued to comprise the largest component of commission revenue  increasing by million  or 
however  brokerage revenues  which posted the largest commission increase of  are fast approaching parity with revenues from variable annuities 
commissions from direct sales of mutual funds were relatively flat  reflecting a continuing trend towards conducting mutual fund sales through our trading platform which revenues are included in brokerage revenues below 
commission revenues from direct participation programs decreased by million or primarily as a result of a significant drop in investments in real estate investment trusts reits 
management believes that the drop in reit activity largely resulted from a decline in the real estate market triggered by a credit contraction due  in major part  to a freeze up of sub prime mortgage markets 
an increase in commissions from our oil and gas programs  spurred by oil price increases  was not sufficient to fully offset the decrease in commissions from reit sales

commission revenue variable annuities    brokerage    direct participation programs   direct mutual funds sales    other    total commission revenue   revenue designated as trading brokerage includes revenue from mutual funds sold through our trading platform 
we continue to emphasize recruitment and retention of representatives who seek to leverage our sophisticated technology platforms which allow us to more efficiently conduct business while increasing total volume 
as discussed below  the recent trend of higher growth from fee based advisory services  compared to commission based services  reflects concerted efforts by management to diversify and grow revenues in the high margin advisory services marketplace 
advisory fees responding to industry trends and increasing client demand  the firm has endeavored to assist our representatives in transitioning more of their business to advisory services 
we do not dictate the general nature or extent of advisory services our representatives provide for their clients 
however  we continue to make concerted efforts to attract our representatives to our expanded line of proprietary advisory services programs through education  seminars  tradeshows and direct telemarketing 
fees from our advisor directed managed assets program  a map  where investment advisory services are provided directly by our independent representatives  continue to be the leading source of advisory services page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  revenue 
revenues from this program  which have been contributing an increasing proportion of advisory services revenue  grew by million or to million compared to million for the prior period 
supported by our net exchange pro and pershing direct on line mainframe brokerage platforms  a map is popular with our representatives because of the opportunities it provides to deliver superior asset management services and overall investment performance at a lower cost 
resulting transactional cost savings have been passed on to our representatives clients in the form of lower fees for improved service 
other fee income other fee income  primarily comprised of licensing and financial planning fees  increased by when comparing the current year to the prior year 
this increase stems mostly from planning fees as more of our qualified representatives are providing consulting services to better assist clients in managing their portfolios 
marketing revenue net marketing revenues decreased by primarily due to a decrease in marketing support for the company s regional event program  which was packaged with the partnership program in the current year 
going forward management is considering limiting these regional events to four symposiums per year 
other income other income  consisting primarily of interest and dividends and gains losses on investments  decreased by 
the majority of the decrease came from a million permanent impairment of a private placement investment and million decrease in interest income from a decrease in cash held at bank accounts 
this decrease was offset by a million increase in interest earned on account balances due to an increase in the average daily balance in our trading accounts

gross margin rose by million or to million for the current period primarily due to a million or increase in gross margin derived from brokerage services 
also contributing to this rise was a million or increase from advisory services driven by our a map program 
brokerage services brokerage services profit margin increased primarily due to an increase in the margin from our fees on account balances 
these fees contribute directly to our profit margin as they require no commission payout 
in addition  there was an increase in gross margins from trading activities that required a commission payout 
as a result of the increase to our profit margin from non commissionable fees on account balances  our total payouts as a percentage of total brokerage revenue decreased slightly for the comparative periods 
the decrease in payout percentage can also be attributed largely to a payout reduction in clearing charges due to a new clearing agreement with our clearing firm 
the significant growth in profit margin reflects the company s emphasis on recruiting quality representatives who can generate brokerage volume using our automated trading platform to execute trades efficiently for their clients 
the company has been focusing on moving more of its business activity into brokerage and advisory services in the belief that such diversification will help buttress overall revenues in the current volatile and down page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  market 
the company intends to seek further growth in profit margin by continuing to encourage a shift from direct check and application business into the more profitable advisory and brokerage services segments 
advisory services the increase in profit margin derived from our advisory services sector in large part can be attributed to an increase in our a map margins 
gross margin from our a map rep directed managed assets program increased by  reflecting growth in assets under management that  in management s opinion  is due primarily to lower fees  improved services and increased awareness of this program 
management has been assisting our representatives to improve advisory services offered to their clients by providing the reps with the resources necessary to better manage portfolios 
our automated trading platform and portfolio consolidation tool enhance our representatives capability to efficiently perform advisory services 
continued improvement in technology allows representatives to better monitor and report the performance of their clients asset models 
management believes that better services and lower fees will lead to growth in assets under management and  ultimately  increases in revenues and profit margin 
growth in profit margin generated by brokerage and advisory services continues to exceed growth generated by our check and application business 
we intend to continue recruiting representatives who are duly licensed and otherwise capable of offering brokerage and advisory services to their clients 
check and application the increase in gross margin from our check and application business came directly from an increase in sales volume of the variable annuity sector 
as a result of a million increase in sales from these product types  we achieved an increase of approximately million in our profit margin in comparing the current period to the prior period 
profit margins from mutual fund sales  variable annuity sales  direct participation programs and other check and application distribution programs generated million or nearly of the total gross margin compared to million or during the prior period 
margin from our check and application distribution programs comprised the greatest portion of our overall profit margin  with profit margin from brokerage being the next leading component among our principal revenue categories 
investments in technology have allowed us to process this additional volume without adding a commensurate level of staff 
commission and advisory fees expense payout retention profit margins are directly aligned to payout of commission and advisory fees to our representatives as a percentage of revenue being generated by them 
it is management s strategy to recruit quality independent representatives who generate recurring revenue that does not flow through the commission and advisory expense payout grid primarily as brokerage commissions and advisory fees 
this strategy is designed to increase our profit margin and overall retention as a result of representatives generating increasing non grid revenue 
management continuously monitors the amount of revenue an independent representative brings in compared to its payout on that revenue 
operating expenses operating expenses rose by million or as discussed below 
compensation and benefits the largest component of operating expense  compensation and benefits increased by million or 
page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  million of this increase was due to an rise in general salaries resulting primarily from the hiring of new personnel as well as cash bonuses and salary pay increases for non executive employees 
in addition  we experienced a million increase in executive officer compensation resulting from cash bonuses  and a million increase in stock compensation due to vesting of restricted stock awards to executives  managers  other employees and independent representatives 
compensation resulting from cash bonuses and vesting of stock grants to executives and managers included gross ups for income taxes payable on such compensation 
regulatory  legal and professional regulatory  legal and professional expenses fell by million or 
the largest component of this decrease was a million decline in legal fees and settlement costs associated with the settlement of the massachusetts proceedings 
legal fees and settlement costs  other than those associated with the massachusetts proceedings  decreased by million 
management believes that this result is directly attributable to the company s risk based management approach that seeks to minimize exposure to litigation 
this approach stresses improving the quality of our registered representatives while committing resources to educate and train our sales force  efficiently and accurately process their business  and appropriately supervise their business activities 
additionally  the company incurred professional fees of 
million in connection with its sarbanes oxley program  as well as auditing and legal defense costs 
the company will continue to incur legal fees and settlement costs as it operates in an increasingly litigious industry embedded with regulation 
consequently  we will continue to invest significant resources to contain future litigation and regulatory exposure by promoting accuracy  ensuring sound operational techniques and applying appropriate compliance measures 
advertising advertising  including related marketing expenses  increased by million or  primarily reflecting a million increase in advertisements in trade journals 
management has been aggressively brand building  placing advertisements in financial services trade publications to communicate to potential representative recruits the key role that our customer service  technology infrastructure and back office support can play to maintain and grow their businesses 
communications communications expenses  which include such items as investor public relations  conferences and telephone  increased by million or 
the increase was due principally to commitment of resources to two conferences for representatives to promote our advisory platforms as well as to stimulate growth in assets under management and production from our top representatives 
we also committed additional resources to the company s website to provide a portfolio consolidation tool and to enhance our ability to communicate to our representatives important updates on the industry s rules and regulations 
occupancy occupancy expenses increased by million or reflecting a full year s cost of opening new investment centers in the fiscal year ended march   an increase in depreciation due to acquiring additional computers  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements for the home office in lynnfield  ma to accommodate the increased number of employees 
page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  other administrative other administrative expenses  which include various insurance  postage  office and computer related expenses  increased by million or due primarily due to a million finra fine regarding our email domain  staff classes and seminars  and charitable donations 
interest expense interest expense increased by reflecting lower margin balances in our firm accounts when comparing the current period to the prior period 
operating and net losses following five consecutive years of annual profitability  the company registered operating and net losses during the two most recent fiscal years despite continued strong annual revenue growth 
the company posted a million operating loss for the fiscal year ended march  after incurring million of costs in the massachusetts proceedings see footnote litigation to our consolidated financial statements 
with these costs behind them  management looked forward to continued revenue growth and a return to profitability in the most recent fiscal year 
over the first nine months of the most recent fiscal year  revenues grew million or  compared to the year ago period  and operating income totaled million 
in addition  management was aware of the patterns generally pertaining in prior years of the company s fourth quarter generating more revenu e than any other quarter in a given fiscal year  and of fourth quarter revenues growing year over year 
based upon the quarterly financial results  internal projections  the aforementioned fourth quarter patterns and other factors  management made rolling projections during the year that the company would return to annual profitability despite authorizing increases in certain expenses during the fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year deemed prudent  under the circumstances  to help secure the long term financial health of the company  including a million increase in selling expenses  primarily for advertising to increase brand awareness among potential new independent representatives and for upgrades to the company s website to enhance representative support  a million increase in compensation expense recorded with respect to the granting of stock to employees including the named executive officers and as tax gross ups with respect to the vesting of stock granted to middle and upper management during the previous fiscal year to enhance employee performance and retention  and a million increase in compensation expense recorded with respect to the granting of cash bonuses to the named executive officers  including tax gross up payments 
contrary to management expectations  fourth quarter revenue for the most recent fiscal year totaled only million 
this represented a million drop over the prior year s fourth quarter  and was million less than the next lowest quarter the first quarter  in terms of revenue  during the most recent fiscal year 
the revenue shortfall  coupled with the expense increases  resulted in a net operating loss of million and an after tax net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  management attributes the annual revenue shortfall  which was punctuated by the dramatic fourth quarter decline  primarily to widespread turmoil in financial markets that initially was triggered by the sub prime mortgage crisis 
the reduction in revenues reflected a significant drop in reits and a major decline in equity investments 
in comparison to the previous third quarter  reits fell by million or and equities fell by million or page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  the company can not forecast the severity or longevity of the impact on the company s financial position and results that may result from a continuation of current financial conditions 
much of such future impact is inherently beyond the company s control 
however  management believes that it is properly positioned to minimize negative impact on revenues by continuing its aggressive efforts to attract and provide quality support to productive representatives who will offer diversified managed portfolios of investments that may encourage clients to remain invested in potentially volatile and down markets 
in addition  management believes that  as the revenue picture continues to unfold  it will have adequate leeway to trim projected expenses without causing significant impairment to its revenue producing potential and its ability to properly supervise the activities of its registered represe ntatives 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that achieving its return on equity goals requires the efficient use of capital 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments and cash flows from operations 
we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet with approximately for and for  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  investments and marketable securities owned  and receivables from our clearing firm and other broker dealers 
the balances in these accounts can and do fluctuate significantly from day to day  depending on general economic and market conditions  volume of activity  and investment opportunities 
these accounts are monitored on a daily basis in order to ensure compliance with regulatory net capital requirements and to preserve liquidity 
cash inflows historically have come primarily from the company s broker dealer and investment advisory services 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million as of march  working capital as of march  was million as compared to million as of march  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of march  as compared to to as of march   principally due to cash disbursements of million in financial settlement form the massachusetts proceedings 
operations provided million in cash for the year ended march  as compared to million of cash provided for the year ended march  in comparing cash flow from operating activities for fiscal year ended march  to fiscal year ended march   cash flow decreased by million as a result of the payment of accrued legal expenses  a million payment pursuant to the settlement of the massachusetts proceedings  and a million settlement of an unrelated case 
in addition  the company had prepaid million in income taxes in projecting a year end profit  however  the lower than projected revenue performance  as well as board approved executive stock compensation charges  had material impact on the results from operations in the current period s fourth quarter 
cash flows from investing activities during the current period primarily consisted of million in cash provided from treasury notes maturing offset by million in cash used to invest in a certificate of deposit and million of cash used to purchase additional equipment  furniture and fixtures 
also during the current period cash used in financing activities consisted mostly of million in principal payments on a short term note to finance insurance premiums along with a million payment of cash dividends on march  for stockholders of record as of february  cash outflows from investing activities for the prior period totaled million of which million resulted from purchasing equipment as well as technology and leasehold improvements 
in addition  we invested million in us treasury bills and notes 
as part of our financing activities we paid a million cash dividend on june  to shareholders of page investors capital holdings  ltd annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  record as of june  additionally  we disbursed million in principal payments on a short term note obligation to finance annual insurance premiums 
cash disbursements during the current period primarily consisted of million in payments for legal fees and settlements of which million resulted from the massachusetts settlement decision 
in addition  the company paid million in cash bonuses to executives and employees 
finally  the company had disbursed million for the prepayment of income taxes as the company had projected a profit in the current period  however  the impact of sub prime mortgage induced lending crisis has had an immediate impact to the company s cash flow 
cash disbursements for legal related matters during the year ended march  totaled million including million for legal fees relating to the massachusetts proceedings and an additional million for the initial payment pertaining to the settlement of the massachusetts proceedings 
management believes  although there can be no assurances  that the scale of the financial damage resulting from the massachusetts proceedings will prove to be atypical of legal proceedings that may be expected to occur in the future 
whether or not management s expectations will come to fruition may in no small measure depend on the degree to which we succeed  through a continually evolving and robust compliance regime  in assuring that the firm and its independent representatives operate in conformity with the many laws  rules and regulations pertaining to our broker dealer and investment advisory operations 
the unexpected disbursements associated with the massachusetts proceedings and the turmoil in financial markets initially induced by the sub prime mortgage crisis have had a significant negative impact on our brokerage firm s net capital ratio during the fiscal years ended march  and the uniform net capital rule rule c under the securities exchange act of requires that icc  our broker dealer subsidiary  maintain net capital of  and a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital a net capital ratio not to exceed to under the rule  indebtedness generally includes all money owed by a company  and net capital includes cash and assets that are easily converted into cash 
sec rules also prohibit equity capital which  under the net capital rule  includes subordinated loans fro m being withdrawn  cash dividends from being paid and other specified actions of similar effect from being taken  if  among other specified contingencies  icc s net capital ratio would exceed to or if icc would have less than of our minimum required net capital 
as of march   icc had net capital of million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as compared to net capital of approximately million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as of march  the company believes its existing assets  which are highly liquid in nature  together with funds generated from operations  should provide adequate funds for continuing operations 
during the prior period the increase in our legal accrual impacted icc s net capital ratio and excess net capital 
in december  ich had to infuse million in capital to icc to offset the cash outflows required for vigorous defense related to the massachusetts proceedings and settlement
