management overview general dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation  combat vehicles  weapons systems and munitions  shipbuilding design and construction  and information systems  technologies and services 
the company operates through four business groups aerospace  combat systems  marine systems and information systems and technology 
general dynamics primary customers are the us military  other us government organizations  the armed forces of other nations  and a diverse base of corporate  government and individual buyers of business aircraft 
the company operates in two primary markets defense and business aviation 
the majority of the company s revenues derive from contracts with the us military 
sales by customer base logo the nation s engagement in the global war on terror  coupled with the need to modernize us military forces  has driven steady department of defense funding increases since in particular  procurement and research and development r d budgets  also known as investment accounts  provide the majority of the company s revenues 
these budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases  demonstrating administration and congressional support 
defense department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of percent from fiscal through  while procurement and r d spending has grown nearly percent annually during that period 
for fiscal year  the congress appropriated billion for the department of defense  including approximately billion for procurement and r d 
budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding  and the company expects that this funding will be applied toward programs over the next few years 
for fiscal year  the president has requested that the congress appropriate billion for the department of defense  a percent increase over the funding 
this includes billion for procurement and r d  an increase of percent over  representing more than one third of the total budget request 
during this period of war  defense budgets have included the president s budget submission  as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter 
for fiscal year  the administration requested approximately billion in supplemental funding  including approximately billion  or percent  for additional investment spending 
the congress has appropriated billion of that request and will consider the remaining billion in if this second supplemental is approved  defense funding for fiscal year will total approximately billion  a percent increase since while these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels  some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover current war needs 
in addition  supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations 
these two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company s programs 
looking ahead  the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term  led by the need to continue to support the operations in iraq and afghanistan 
while the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period  the company expects near term defense funding to be driven primarily by the following continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment  the number of troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan  coupled with the increase in the overall size of the us military  the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war  and the need to modernize the country s military infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern day warfare 
based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets  the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in and defense funding logo general dynamics annual report 
table of contents beyond the company s us defense market  governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs  leading to expanding defense export opportunities 
the company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies 
while the revenue upside can be significant  european and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing  defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures 
as general dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world  the company expects growing international sales 
the business aviation market also continues to expand  and was another strong year 
despite the recent uncertainty in the us macroeconomic environment  the aerospace group s north american and international order activity remains robust 
following seven consecutive quarters with a book to bill ratio exceeding one  the aerospace s record backlog extends through for large cabin models 
at this juncture  management has not observed any indications of backlog weakness such as cancellations  financing issues or requests to delay delivery 
the company expects continued growth in the business jet market  stemming from its strong products in the long range and ultra long range markets  and robust sales of the company s mid size products 
in particular  the market for the company s business jets outside the united states has demonstrated powerful growth 
in  for the first time in the company s history  gulfstream received more than percent of its aircraft orders from outside north america 
of note  the european and asian markets comprised more than one third of the group s orders in  and demand remains strong 
general dynamics management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices  disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements 
the company s solid performance over the past years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow 
general dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided the company s management the flexibility to execute its operational strategy  and enabled it to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions  payment of dividends and share repurchases 
consolidated overview the following discussion of the company s results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level 
the disclosures focus on the material financial measures the company s management uses to evaluate the performance of each of its four business groups  including sales  operating earnings and margins  and backlog 
for the defense business groups  the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group s results rather than types of products and services  which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers 
for the aerospace group  the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services  consistent with how the group is managed 
in the defense business groups  the majority of the sales are generated by long term government contracts 
as discussed further in the critical accounting policies section  the company accounts for sales under these contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered  as applicable 
as a result  changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume 
volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels  changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 
in the aerospace group  sales contracts for new aircraft typically have two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s completion  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics 
the company records revenues at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
changes in sales in this group result from the amount of new aircraft deliveries both green and completion  the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre owned aircraft sold 
operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume  performance  or the mix of contracts and the phases of work within those contracts eg  fixed price cost reimbursable  development production 
performance logo general dynamics annual report 
table of contents refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts 
these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and or the estimated costs required to complete the contract 
the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract 
operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are generally a function of the prices the company is able to charge for its various aircraft models  the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft  and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher margin large cabin and lower margin mid size aircraft 
additional factors affecting the group s earnings and margins include the number and type of pre owned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group  which include selling expenses and research and development costs 
results of operations year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin general dynamics generated strong results in compared with  ending the year with the highest sales  operating earnings  net earnings  cash flow from operations  orders and backlog in the company s history 
the company produced solid sales growth in on the strength of rising sales in each of the company s business groups 
in particular  the combat systems and aerospace groups generated the most substantial sales growth in due to strong worldwide demand for military vehicles and business jet aircraft 
sales in the information systems and technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of anteon international corporation in  as organic growth in the group s north american market was largely offset by a scheduled reduction in sales in the united kingdom 
sales were up slightly in the marine systems group compared with the company s operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in  the result of significant operating leverage achieved in three of the company s four business groups 
the aerospace group s margins improved basis points on the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements 
margins in the combat systems and marine systems groups were up basis points and basis points  respectively  due to improving operational execution 
overall  the company s operating margins increased basis points for the second year in a row to percent in the company s continued focus on operations has generated four consecutive years of operating margin expansion and a total basis point improvement in margins over the past five years 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the company s sales and operating earnings increased significantly in increased new aircraft deliveries in the aerospace group  strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the combat systems group  and acquisitions in the information systems and technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales 
each of the company s four business groups generated double digit earnings growth in in particular  the marine systems group s operating earnings grew over percent due to significantly improved performance on its ship construction programs 
the aerospace group s earnings also increased substantially on strong new aircraft volume and improved pricing on units delivered in compared with deliveries 
the improved performance resulted in an overall increase in the company s operating margins from percent in to percent in cash flow the company produced significant cash flows from operations in  generating cash from operations in excess of net earnings for the ninth consecutive year 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in and billion in each of and in addition  the company generated over in cash in both and from the sale of several non core businesses 
over the three year period  the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase its common stock  pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt

backlog logo general dynamics total backlog was billion at year end  up percent from billion at the end of funded backlog increased percent in to billion compared with billion at year end the company generated total new orders of billion in  representing significant order activity across each of the company s business groups during the year 
the total backlog for the company s defense businesses decreased percent to billion at year end  compared with billion at the end of the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of this backlog was billion at the end of this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments 
the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  the company has included in the backlog only firm contracts it believes are likely to receive funding 
the aerospace group s total backlog increased billion or percent in  reaching a new high of billion at year end 
the group received a record number of orders during the year  resulting in funded backlog of billion at the end of  up percent over the funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
the aerospace unfunded backlog of at year end consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
the company s backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts  unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft 
idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
these agreements  which set forth the majority of the contractual terms  including prices  are funded as delivery orders are placed 
a significant portion of the company s idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole source supplier to design  develop  produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies 
management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems 
however  because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders  the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 
contract options in the company s defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts  if the customer exercises the option 
these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date 
contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft 
the company recognizes options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents as of december   the potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately billion  up from billion at the end of the company expects to realize this value over the next years 
this represents management s estimate of the potential value the company will receive 
the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 
review of operating segments aerospace results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group continued its strong performance in as sales and operating earnings increased significantly over growing global demand for business jets has led to successive years of significant order activity and resulting substantial growth in the group s backlog 
to meet this demand  the group has steadily increased its aircraft production rate and delivery schedule 
as a result  new aircraft sales grew percent in  including a percent increase in green aircraft deliveries and a percent increase in completions 
in addition  aircraft services volume increased by percent over  reflecting the growing global installed base of business jet aircraft 
pre owned aircraft activity declined significantly in as increasing numbers of customers chose to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them 
sales of pre owned aircraft were in compared with in the aerospace group s operating earnings and margins increased substantially in compared with operating earnings were up approximately as a result of the increased new aircraft and aircraft services volume 
improved pricing on units delivered in compared with deliveries  combined with labor efficiencies and productivity improvements particularly in the completion process  contributed another of earnings growth 
increased selling costs associated with the year s substantial order activity  higher product development spending and increased g a costs reduced the group s earnings growth by about reduced sales of pre owned aircraft lowered the earnings growth by the operating leverage achieved by the group  offset in part by a mix shift to include proportionately more lower margin mid size aircraft deliveries  resulted in a basis point increase in new aircraft margins over aircraft services margins were up basis points over overall  the aerospace group produced a basis point increase in margins for the second consecutive year 
the company expects to deliver new aircraft in  an increase of percent over based on this projected increase in deliveries  the company expects the aerospace group s sales will grow between and percent in combining the improved pricing in the scheduled deliveries with increased spending on research and development  the company expects the group s operating margins to be to basis points higher than those achieved in year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s sales growth in was due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries 
new aircraft sales increased percent in over green deliveries were up percent while aircraft completions were up percent 
the group introduced the mid size g aircraft in  which added green deliveries and eight completions 
aircraft services sales increased percent in  while pre owned aircraft sales remained steady compared to operating earnings in increased approximately as a result of higher new aircraft volume 
pricing improvements on all aircraft models overcame a shift in the mix of deliveries in the second half of the year toward proportionately more mid size aircraft deliveries to contribute an additional of operating earnings 
improved margins on pre owned aircraft sales increased operating earnings by while higher product development spending and selling costs reduced the operating earnings growth by backlog logo the aerospace group s backlog was billion at the end of  an increase of percent over the group s funded backlog grew percent in to billion at year end 
the group received a record level of orders for the fourth consecutive year  and after increasing general dynamics annual report

the following table summarizes key unit data for the aerospace group s orders and backlog year ended december new orders options exercised firm orders as of december firm contracts in backlog completions in backlog represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end 
the backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft 
the group s order profile in reflected continued strong activity in the north american market as well as rising demand around the world  which resulted in a shift to include over percent of orders in the year from customers outside north america for the first time 
the group s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through combat systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin among the company s four business groups  combat systems experienced the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings in and in the fourth quarter generated the highest quarterly sales and operating earnings of any segment in the company s history 
this strong performance resulted from continued growth across all of the group s product lines  with particularly strong growth in the company s military vehicle markets worldwide 
as a result  each of the group s businesses experienced double digit sales and earnings increases in over half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group s us military vehicle business  including core programs as well as adjacent market opportunities 
the ongoing us presence in iraq and afghanistan and the military s need to reset and repair vehicles damaged in military operations continued to generate strong demand for the group s combat vehicles and related services 
sales increased percent in this business in compared with  driven by the following primary contributors the company s ongoing abrams main battle tank modernization work  activity on the stryker wheeled combat vehicle program  the ramp up of production of light armored vehicles lavs for the us marine corps  and the production of military vehicles under the mine resistant  ambush protected mrap vehicle program 
the group supports the m abrams tank by providing upgrades  including the abrams integrated management aim  the system enhancement package sep and the tank urban survivability kit tusk 
stryker continued to be the group s largest program in  with volume up most significantly on contractor logistics support activity 
mrap emerged as a high priority acquisition program for the marine corps and army during the group s munitions business also contributed significantly to the group s sales and earnings in sales were up almost percent in this business in compared with the munitions business generated approximately percent organic sales growth  with particularly strong volume in its large and medium caliber munitions supply contracts 
the remainder of the increase in sales resulted from the acquisition of snc technologies inc snc tec from snc lavalin group inc  in january snc tec is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small  medium and large caliber ammunition and related products to the canadian forces  us and other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world 
sales in the group s weapons systems business grew percent in due primarily to increased activity on a contract to produce systems that protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds 
the group s european military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost percent in increased activity on various programs to produce military vehicles for non us governments was the most significant factor in the increased sales 
in particular  volume was up in on the pandur ii wheeled vehicle contracts for portugal and the czech republic and the piranha wheeled armored vehicle programs for several european governments 
in december  the czech republic cancelled the company s contract for vehicles 
the company is in discussions with the czech republic about a contract for a reduced quantity 
while these general dynamics annual report 
table of contents discussions may result in an overall reduction in the size of the czech pandur contract  the company does not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group s operating results 
the combat systems group s operating margins improved basis points in compared with the margins achieved by the group in margins increased due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group s wheeled military vehicle programs 
the improvement in the group s margins was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lower margin acquisitions in the munitions business  increased supplier costs on the group s small caliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with the company s exit from the group s european commercial trading business 
the company expects sales growth in the combat systems group in the to percent range based on the group s substantial backlog  with operating margins improving to basis points over the margins 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group s sales and operating earnings increased substantially in over sales in the group s us and european military vehicle businesses were up percent due to higher production activity on the stryker program and several european military vehicle contracts 
activity also increased on the army s future combat systems fcs development program and various domestic and international lav contracts 
the group s weapons systems and munitions businesses generated a percent increase in sales in compared with high demand for protection systems for us forces and increased volume on a contract to provide small caliber ammunition to the army contributed to the growth in these businesses in the group s acquisition of chamberlain manufacturing corporation s scranton operation in contributed approximately percent of the group s total sales growth

the company s roic has grown basis points since return on invested capital logo management believes roic is a useful measure for investors  because it reflects the company s ability to generate returns from the capital it has deployed in its operations 
the company uses roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
management defines roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft general dynamics annual report 
table of contents inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition government contracts 
the company accounts for sales and earnings under long term government contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered  as applicable 
the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg  costs incurred or output measures eg  units delivered  as appropriate to the circumstances 
the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
however  the company includes revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes which has been superseded by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified 
anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts  including g a expenses 
the company uses the reallocation method  because management believes the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue  total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on the company s long term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods 
management believes these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and  therefore  the reallocation method is the method that best matches the company s revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned 
while the company has applied this method consistently for over years  most contractors use the cumulative catch up method 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently considering a standard on the hierarchy of gaap  which  as currently drafted  would eliminate the company s ability to use this method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
the company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 
in evaluating these criteria  management considers the contractual legal basis for the claim  the cause of any additional costs incurred  the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim 
the company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee 
estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 
business aircraft 
the company accounts for contracts for business jet aircraft in accordance with statement of position these contracts usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
the company records revenue at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 
goodwill 
since  general dynamics has acquired businesses at a total cost of over billion  including four in in connection with these acquisitions  the company has recognized billion of goodwill 
goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management  particularly the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units  and these estimates require the use of judgment 
management estimates the fair value of the general dynamics annual report 
table of contents company s reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations 
this requires numerous assumptions  including the timing of work embedded in the company s backlog  the company s performance and profitability under its contracts  its success in securing future business  and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows 
this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top down analyses  including a market assessment of the company s enterprise value 
beyond the annual impairment test  factors that may lead the company to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of the company s reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the company has recorded no goodwill impairment to date and does not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future 
commitments and contingencies 
the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company s exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of the company s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of the company s estimated workers compensation  other insurance related assessments  pension and other post retirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid  at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government 
the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business  including existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under the company s contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on management s best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of the company s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
the company s defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long term rates of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
the company determines the long term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment  including consideration of current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
the following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the company s commercial pension plans and post retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on increase bps decrease bps increase decrease to net pension income from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease to post retirement benefit cost from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets as discussed under deferred contract costs  the company s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company s government retirement plans 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
as such  the company s future earnings are not subject to the consequences of annual changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 
management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
foreign currency risk the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers  outstanding debt and certain inter company transactions denominated in currencies other than the company s or one of its subsidiaries functional currency 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non functional payments  receipts and inter company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities 
these contracts are designed to minimize non functional currency risks and or risks associated with international subsidiaries that may enter into transactions outside of their own functional currency 
at december  and  the company had billion and billion  respectively  in notional contracts outstanding 
a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental recognized pretax loss of in and in  and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of in and in this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in us dollar canadian dollar and euro swiss franc exchange rates 
the company believes the recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 
interest rate risk financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate debt obligations  variable rate commercial paper and short term investments 
as of december  and  the company had only fixed rate debt outstanding 
the company s fixed rate debt obligations are not putable and are not traded by the company in the market 
a percent change in current interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt obligations 
the company would be subject to interest rate risk from outstanding commercial paper  but there were no outstanding balances at year end or the company s investment policy allows for purchases of fixed income securities with an investment grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years 
the company held billion in cash and equivalents and short term investments to be used for general corporate purposes as of december   and billion as of december  given the weighted average maturity of days as of december   and days as of december   a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings in either year 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk the company is also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices  primarily on long term fixed price contracts 
to the extent possible  the company includes terms in its contracts that are designed to protect it from this risk 
the company has not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant 
some of the protective terms included in the company s contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract 
the company does not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows
