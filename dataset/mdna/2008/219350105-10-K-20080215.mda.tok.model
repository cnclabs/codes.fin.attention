item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our key priorities for remained unchanged from the previous three years protect our financial health  improve our profitability  and invest in the future 
we made significant progress on these in financial health in  our balance sheet remained strong and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities 
significant items in included the following in the first quarter  we repurchased million of our euro notes due in in the second quarter  all three of our rating agencies upgraded our debt ratings to bbb or the equivalent 
operating cash flow for the year was billion which was significantly greater than our billion of capital spending 
in the third quarter of  we began paying dividends on the company s common stock 
we repurchased million shares of common stock for million as part of a repurchase program announced in the second quarter 
we ended with billion in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this represents an increase of million from december  our revolving credit facility  amended in november  provides committed access to a billion unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through march we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations  the asbestos settlement  research and development  capital expenditures  scheduled debt repayments  dividend payments  and our stock repurchase program 
profitability for the year ended december   we generated net income of billion or per share compared to net income of billion or per share for the improvement in net income was due largely to the following items higher net income in the display technologies segment driven by strong sales volumes and an increase in equity earnings from samsung corning precision when compared to higher net income in the telecommunications segment primarily due to market growth for telecommunications products and the absence of an impairment charge  which totaled million in higher net income in the environmental technologies segment due to strong sales of automotive and diesel products 
the increase in net income was offset by asbestos settlement expense of million in compared to a credit of million in reflecting the change in the settlement value of corning s asbestos settlement liability 
the change in the settlement value of this liability was primarily attributable to the change in the value of million shares of corning s common stock to be contributed to the proposed settlement 
net income was also negatively impacted by restructuring  impairment  and other charges at samsung corning 
our share of these charges in was million 
refer to note investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these items 
investing in our future we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems 
we remain committed to investing in research  development  and engineering to drive innovation 
in  approximately one third of our total research  development and engineering expenditures were for research 
this spending related to our existing businesses  new business development  exploratory research  and early stage marketing 
we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds  diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards  and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises 
we are also making increased investments in new technologies such as the epic system  synthetic green lasers  silicon on glass  and microreactors 
our research  development and engineering expenditures increased by million in when compared to but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales 
we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
we also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses 
our capital expenditures were primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment and diesel products in the environmental technologies segment 
total capital expenditures for were billion  of which million was directed toward our display technologies segment and million was invested in our environmental technologies segment 
in addition  in april  we announced a million facility improvement plan for the company s sullivan park research and development campus near corning  new york 
the expansion is expected to be completed over a six year period 
we expect our capital spending to be in the range of billion to billion  of which approximately million to billion will be directed toward our display technologies segment 
in december  we announced a year capital expenditure plan of million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation s plant in sakai city  japan 
production from this new facility is expected to meet sharp corporation s plan to begin production of lcd panels for large televisions by march in february  we announced a million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung  taiwan 
the range provided for for our display technologies segment includes some spending for recently announced projects

expenditures for the past three years have been focused on our display technologies  environmental technologies and telecommunications segments as we looked to capitalize on market opportunities in those segments 
expenses in each year also reflect costs associated with later stage development projects to support future growth 
these projects include investments in new technologies such as synthetic green lasers  silicon on glass  and microreactors 
restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits corning recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in and which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented 
a description of those charges follows impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill impairment charge for assets held for use in  we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of million to impair certain long lived assets of our telecommunications segment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
due to our lowered long term outlook for this business  we determined that an event of impairment  as defined by sfas  had occurred in that business  which further required us to test this asset group for impairment 
we assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 
as a result of our impairment evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value 
other credits reversal of currency translation adjustment in  corning sold its photonic business operations to avanex 
the photonics business was the sole operation of corning oti oti oti  a wholly owned italian subsidiary of corning  whose results were included in corning s telecommunications segment 
subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of oti to avanex  corning began liquidating oti 
in october  the assets of oti were determined to be substantially liquidated 
as a result of the substantial liquidation  oti s cumulative translation account was reversed  resulting in a gain of million in the fourth quarter 
impairment of available for sale securities impairment charge in  we recorded impairment charges of million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in avanex corporation avanex below its adjusted cost basis

legal settlement asbestos on march   corning announced that it had reached agreement the pcc plan with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against it and pittsburgh corning corporation pcc  which might arise from pcc products or operations 
the proposed settlement  if the pcc plan is approved and becomes effective  will require corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc  contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce  a belgian corporation  and contribute million shares of corning common stock 
corning also agreed to pay a total of million in six annual installments present value million at march  beginning one year after the pcc plan becomes effective  with percent interest from june  and to assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of settlement 
the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march hearings to consider objections to the pcc plan were held in the bankruptcy court in may in february  the bankruptcy court requested that the pcc plan proponents delete references to section a of the bankruptcy code and resubmit the pcc plan 
the final round of oral argument was held on july  on december   the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the pcc plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion 
several parties  including corning  filed motions for reconsideration 
these motions were argued on march   and the bankruptcy court reserved decision 
on january   some of the parties in the proceeding advised the bankruptcy court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization that would make it unnecessary for the bankruptcy court to decide the motion for reconsideration 
if the bankruptcy court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form or parties to the proceeding agree to amend the pcc plan  changes to the pcc plan are reasonably likely to occur that could significantly reduce the value corning would pay in such a changed plan 
the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain  and confirmation of the current pcc plan or any amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
however  apart from the quarterly mark to market adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement  management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
two of corning s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies  including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above 
corning is vigorously contesting these cases 
management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation 
since march   we have recorded total net charges of billion to reflect the initial settlement liability and subsequent adjustments for the change in the settlement value of the components of the liability 
the following summarizes the charges and credits we have recorded for the proposed asbestos settlement in millions for the years ended december  initial settlement charge fair market value adjustment for other components mark to market common stock asbestos settlement if the book value of the assets to be contributed in the asbestos settlement remains lower than the carrying value of the settlement liability  a gain would be recognized at the time of settlement 
the liability expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in pce  assigned insurance proceeds  and the million shares of our common stock  which totals million at december   is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets 
this portion of the pcc liability is considered a due on demand obligation 
accordingly  this portion of the obligation has been classified as a current liability even though it is possible that the contribution could be made beyond one year 
the remaining portion of the settlement liability  which totals million at december   representing the net present value of the cash payments  is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets

income before income taxes in addition to the items identified under gross margin  restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits and asbestos settlement  the items below had an impact on income before income taxes as follows for the years ended december  loss on repurchases and retirement of debt  net movements in exchange rates provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions for the years ended december  provision for income taxes effective income tax rate the effective income tax rates for and differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the us  the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets  and the benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the impact of our inability to record tax benefits on net operating losses generated in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  the increase of our us valuation allowance of million  and the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 provides that deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of greater than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
sfas no 
further requires that in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  objective evidence eg actual  historical information should be given greater weight than subjective evidence eg the outlook for future profitability 
in and we recorded valuation allowances against our entire us deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the us in recent years 
in doing so  we recorded valuation allowances against our us deferred tax assets that existed at december   as well as against additional us deferred tax assets generated in and due to losses in those years 
in both and  we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 
the impact of the release of valuation allowances and  thus  not recording tax expense on income generated in the us is a reduction in our effective tax rate of for both and we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our entire us deferred tax assets as of december  because we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate in the future sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets 
us profits of approximately billion dollars would be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december  of that amount  billion of us profits would be required over the next years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards 
our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is inherently subjective and is based on our analysis and weighting of all positive and negative evidence available to us 
this evaluation includes estimates and assumptions about a number of market  execution and economic variables 
our judgment as of december  has been formed based on these variables which include we had a taxable loss in the us in and  absent nonrecurring items  we would have also had a taxable loss in the us in is the only year in the last three years in which we have generated income in the us when considering only recurring items 
although our consolidated net income has reached record levels  we have continued to incur losses or have generated only marginal profitability in the us because a display technologies  the key driver of our consolidated profitability  is largely a foreign based business with only net royalty income occurring in the us  b our environmental and life sciences segments have lost money or have been only marginally profitable due to very significant us based factory start up costs and developmental spending  and c improvement in our telecommunications segment has been more than offset by higher us based research  development  and engineering  stock and incentive compensation and other administrative expenses 
a significant factor in our forecasts of future us taxable profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our display technologies businesses to the us the amount of such royalties could decline if our sales of lcd glass are impacted by manufacturing capacity constraints  a reduced demand due to the slowing of corporate information technology and consumer spending or b challenges to pricing  both of which may arise from global economic pressures  or shifts in the global market share of our customers which manufacture flat panel tv and computer monitors 
additionally  a change in our judgment regarding the sustainability of the level of these royalties in accordance with the principles of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin may also impact our forecasts of us profitability 
although we remain optimistic about our consolidated outlook for and beyond  as of december   we are sufficiently uncertain about our us based results primarily due to the current economic uncertainty but also due to a number of market and execution risks in our operating segments  particularly those pertaining to display technologies  as noted above that we have concluded that the positive evidence supporting realization of our u 
s deferred tax assets does not sufficiently outweigh the negative evidence that we may not realize our us deferred tax assets 
we will update our assessment of the realizability of our us deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis in  taking into account year to date actual as well as forecasted us results 
if  after considering the actual results and the potential impact of the economic uncertainties and business risks considered in our year end assessment as well as our fin assessment of the display technologies us royalties  we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be profitable in the us in and future years  we will quantify the portion of our us deferred tax assets we believe to be realizable and reduce our valuation allowance accordingly 
until that time  we will continue to adjust the valuation allowance to offset the current us income tax expense or benefit that would otherwise be recorded on income or losses in the us and  therefore  reflect no net us income tax expense 
in  we recorded valuation allowances against our entire german and australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years 
in  due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall german operations  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the german national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance is no longer required 
in  due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in australia and at certain of our german operations  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the german local and the entire australian deferred tax assets were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required 
the impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of and for and  respectively 
certain foreign subsidiaries in china  south africa and taiwan are or were operating under tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years to according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions 
the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of   and  for   and  respectively 
in addition to the aforementioned benefit of tax holidays  the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to increasing the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in  significant events occurred which required us to increase the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
at that time  we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net us deferred tax assets of approximately million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in dow corning  a non strategic appreciated asset  if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards 
during  dow corning s performance was much stronger than expected and dow corning resumed paying a dividend  both of which are expected to continue in the future 
due to this improved performance  we concluded that dow corning provides strong financial  geographic and market balance to corning s portfolio of businesses  the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment 
as a result  we considered dow corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of dow corning would be prudent  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
therefore  we no longer believed  in the fourth quarter of  that it was more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we increased our valuation allowance by million to fully reserve our net us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of  which increased our effective tax rate by see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments in millions samsung corning precision dow corning samsung corning all other total equity earnings the and increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments  are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning when compared to the previous years 
additional information about the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment 
dow corning performance was driven by sales growth in their traditional silicone product lines and in polysilicones for the semiconductor and solar energy industries 
dow corning sales grew approximately in approximately of dow corning s sales were in their traditional silicone product lines 
the remaining sales were from polysilicone products 
net income at dow corning  and corning s resulting equity earnings from dow corning  increased in when compared to  reflecting the growth in net sales offset in part by the non repeat of a million favorable irs settlement in described below

the environmental technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments  as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 
the following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment display technologies manufactures glass substrates for use in liquid crystal flat panel displays  telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable  and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry  environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications  and life sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for pharmaceutical and scientific applications 
all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as all other 
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions

corning continues to invest heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates 
in and  capital spending in this segment was million and million  respectively 
we expect capital spending for to be in the range of million to billion 
in december  we announced a year capital expenditure plan of million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation s plant in sakai city  japan 
production from this new facility is expected to meet sharp corporation s plan to begin production of lcd panels for large televisions by march in february  we announced a million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung  taiwan

the net sales increase for reflected overall lcd glass market growth 
during  glass substrate volumes increased compared with  driven by the same factors described in sales of large size glass substrates accounted for of total sales volumes in the growth in volume was partially offset by declines in weighted average selling prices of approximately 
movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate negatively impacted sales by approximately million or when compared with in the second quarter of  the display technologies segment reported its first quarterly sequential decline in volume since the third quarter of the lower volume was the result of a number of our customers  primarily in taiwan  idling part of their facilities and thus reducing their demand for glass  as a result of a build up of panel inventory in the supply chain 
both volume and sales increased in the third quarter of when our customers reduced their inventories and began ramping up lcd panel production to meet seasonally stronger demand 
for  the increase in income before equity earnings was primarily the result of higher volumes and manufacturing cost reductions  offset somewhat by lower prices and the impact of exchange rates 
movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted income before equity earnings by approximately when compared with the increase in our equity earnings  primarily from samsung corning precision  was largely driven by the same market factors identified for our wholly owned business 
in  samsung corning precision s earnings were negatively impacted by approximately from movements in exchange rates compared to equity earnings from samsung corning precision are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
in and  corning and several customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which the display technologies segment agreed to supply large size glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years 
as part of the agreements  these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased 
in and  corning received million and million  respectively  of customer deposits and issued million and million  respectively in credit memoranda 
we do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 
refer to note other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in the event customers elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits 
if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits 
outlook we expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates driven by increased end market demand for lcd televisions 
absent the impact of an economic slowdown  we anticipate the volume growth in the lcd glass market to be between and in the expected market volume growth  measured in square feet  for the year should be equal to the volume growth in the market in corning s lcd glass volume is expected to grow at the lower end of this range  while samsung corning precision s volume growth should be higher than the range 
growth rates by region for the industry generally  and thus for corning s wholly owned business and samsung corning precision  may be different based on market dynamics 
we expect sales volume in the first quarter of to be consistent with the fourth quarter of  as lcd glass is in short supply 
we expect price declines in the first quarter of to be similar to the fourth quarter of although end market demand for lcd televisions  monitors and notebooks currently remains strong  we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions  particularly the slowing us economy  and political tensions could have on consumer demand 
there is no assurance that the end market rates of growth will continue at the rates experienced in recent years  that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand  or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period 
while the industry has grown rapidly  consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  prices  or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth 
therefore  it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment

approximately of segment net sales were sold into the public network market 
growth in the public network market was driven by favorable public policy  especially in the us  which fosters facilities based competition and by strong financial health of service providers worldwide 
financially sound service providers have the ability to maintain or increase capital spending on network investments 
during the year  there was a broadening of worldwide access construction projects such as fiber to the premises and fiber to the node 
approximately of the world s largest access service providers had some activity related to access construction  which was up from in the remaining of this segment s net sales were sold into the private network market 
demand in the private network market was driven  in particular  by growth in data centers 
growth in the public and private markets had a favorable impact on both optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment product sales 
in  corning introduced the clearcurve ultra bendable optical fiber based suite of products that enable fiber deployments to multi dwelling units 
we expect to begin shipments of clearcurve products in early effective april   corning sold its european submarine cabling business and recorded a gain of million on the sale 
effective april   advance cable systems acs  currently an equity company affiliate  assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in japan 
as a result of these two transactions  sales for are not comparable to sales for the same period last year 
telecommunications segment net sales  excluding the impact of sales of submarine cabling products and sales of optical cable in japan  increased percent in this is a non gaap financial measure which management believes is useful to investors to understand the year over year growth of this segment s net sales 
the following is a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the related gaap measure change telecommunications segment net sales gaap sales of submarine cabling products sales of optical cable in japan telecommunications segment net sales excluding the above two items non gaap in  optical fiber market volume exceeded the previous market peak which occurred in  confirming a recovery from the global telecommunications market downturn 
volume increases in were offset somewhat by price declines when compared to the previous year 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  when compared to net income in increased when compared to due to improvements in segment sales  cost reductions  the impact of the million gain on the sale of the european submarine cabling business  and the absence of an impairment charge which totaled million in a favorable mix for optical fiber and cable products also contributed to improvements in segment net income 
in  net income of this segment was positively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared with the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base 
in  two customers of the telecommunications segment  which individually accounted for more than of total segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales when combined 
vs 
increases in segment net sales were driven by improved sales in north america  europe and china 
the increase was driven by a broader recovery in the telecommunications industry and growth in the private network market 
volume increases were offset somewhat by continued price declines when compared to movements in foreign exchange rates which can affect this segment s net sales  primarily the euro and japanese yen  did not have a significant impact on sales in when compared to the previous year 
as noted above  sales of this segment in were negatively impacted when acs assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in japan 
sales of optical cable and hardware and equipment in japan  which are now recorded by an equity affiliate  were million in and million in for the telecommunications segment  net income in and was impacted by restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits 
in  we recorded an after tax impairment charge of million 
in  we recorded net after tax credits of million 
refer to results of operations for a discussion of these items 
the decline in net income for this segment in  when compared to  was primarily the result of the impairment charge described above and the absence of net after tax credits of million that were recorded in in  movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact the results for this operating segment 
outlook for the telecommunications segment  we expect sales and earnings to increase in  reflecting continued strength in public and private network demand when compared to the last two years 
growth in the public network market is expected to benefit from increasing access construction activity 
private network growth is expected to result from data centers  internet protocol networks  and increased network speed which favors optical fiber products over copper 
we expect sales in the first quarter of to increase by approximately when compared to the fourth quarter of sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our largest customer 
we expect manufacturing efficiencies will offset price declines 
changes in our customer s expected deployment plan  or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products  could also affect the sales level 
should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated  our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 
environmental technologies the following table provides net sales and other data for the environmental technologies segment dollars in millions change vs 
vs 
net sales automotive diesel total net sales net income loss vs 
sales of the environmental technologies segment in were higher when compared to due to increased sales from the diesel product lines and strong demand for automotive substrates 
diesel sales in reflected increased sales of heavy duty diesel products to meet the us emission regulations which went into effect on january  sales of automotive products also improved when compared to last year due to an increase in sales to european and asian customers 
net sales of this segment were positively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 
net income of this segment was up when compared to last year due to higher sales  manufacturing efficiencies  and the impact of favorable movements in foreign exchange rates offset slightly by modest price declines 
improved utilization of our diesel manufacturing capacity also contributed to increased net income in this segment 
net income was positively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 
the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems  who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers  the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
in  three customers of the environmental technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales 
vs 
sales of this segment in were somewhat higher than last year due to improvements in diesel products sales  primarily for light duty diesel vehicle applications 
however  this increase was offset by a decline in automotive product sales due to lower volumes 
as end customers shift demand toward smaller  more energy efficient vehicles  demand for larger automobiles has declined 
this shift in demand has caused our automotive substrate volumes to decline because our market share is relatively higher for manufacturers of larger vehicles 
in addition  volumes have been negatively impacted because smaller vehicles require proportionately smaller substrates 
movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for this segment 
the decrease in net income in versus was due primarily to increased research  development  and engineering spending in preparation for the growth in sales of heavy duty and light duty diesel products 
outlook we expect both sales and earnings improvements in the environmental technologies segment in automotive substrate sales are expected to remain even with levels 
diesel products sales are expected to increase more than in as regulations that require heavy duty diesel filters such as ours to meet tighter emission standards continue to drive sales improvements 
heavy duty diesel sales have been impacted by the weak freight market in the us the pace of recovery in that market will influence the rate of growth in sales of diesel products 
segment profitability is expected to increase due to higher diesel volumes and manufacturing cost reductions 
we expect sales in the first quarter to increase by approximately when compared to the fourth quarter of last year 
changes in automotive and diesel vehicle production could adversely impact sales and net income of this segment 
life sciences the following table provides net sales and other data for the life sciences segment dollars in millions change vs 
vs 
net sales net loss vs 
net sales of the life sciences segment were up when compared to last year driven by market growth and higher prices 
government and private spending for drug development  discovery  and production  continue to drive market growth in this segment 
movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales for the periods presented 
improved profitability of this segment in resulted from higher sales  movements in foreign exchange rates  manufacturing efficiencies  and the absence of restructuring charges 
segment profitability in all years was impacted by development spending for new products 
movements in foreign exchange rates had a million favorable impact on results of this segment for when compared with in the life sciences segment  one customer accounted for approximately of this segment s net sales in vs 
net sales of the life sciences segment were up slightly in when compared to due to increased prices offset by volume declines in the us movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales 
the segment operated at a loss due to significant research  development  and engineering spending related to the epic system  a high throughput label free screening platform based on optical biosensor technology  which had its market launch in the segment loss also includes million of severance  curtailment  and asset impairment costs related to the shutdown of a facility in the united kingdom 
outlook sales for are expected to increase over driven by market growth  price increases  and sales of epic system products

capital spending capital spending totaled billion  billion and billion in   and  respectively 
capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of lcd glass capacity in the display technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental technologies segment 
our capital spending program is expected to be in the range of billion to billion  with approximately million to billion used to expand manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment 
additionally  approximately million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment to support the emerging diesel emissions control products and approximately million will be spent on the expansion of the company s sullivan park research and development campus 
short term investments included in our billion short term investments at december   were million of asset backed securities 
asset backed securities are collateralized by credit card loans  auto loans  mortgages  and student loans 
at december   our exposure to sub prime mortgages was million 
unrealized losses on securities backed by sub prime mortgages  which are rated as investment grade  were approximately million at december   and are expected to recover in the short term 
realized losses on these items amounted to million in defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees 
our funding policy has been to contribute  as necessary  an amount in excess of the minimum requirements in order to achieve the company s long term funding targets 
in  we made voluntary cash contributions of million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and million to our international pension plans 
in  we made an incremental cash contribution of million to our domestic and international pension plans 
customer deposits certain customers of our display technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates 
the deposits will be reduced through future product purchases  thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 
customer deposits have been received in the following periods in millions total customer deposits received we do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
corning s off balance sheet arrangements include the following guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 
fin requires a company  at the time a guarantee is issued  to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 
refer to note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under fasb interpretation r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r 
the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 
for variable interest entities  we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by fin r 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity s net assets excluding variable interests 
corning is the primary beneficiary of one of the three entities  and as required by fin r the financial statements of the entity are included in corning s consolidated financial statements 
corning is not the primary beneficiary of two of the three variable interest entities and as such  fin r does not require corning to include them in it s consolidated financial statements 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity 
in and prior to adopting sfas r  corning had employee compensation awards stock options that were excluded from the balance sheet 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value 
paragraph a of sfas provides an exception to this requirement for contracts that are indexed to an entity s own stock and classified in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  prior to adopting sfas r  employee stock option awards were excluded from the balance sheet because they met the paragraph a criteria 
in and  those options were recorded in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
in and in the first quarter of  we had other non employee contracts that did not meet the criteria in paragraph a 
those contracts were considered derivative instruments and were accounted for as such in the respective reporting periods 
contractual obligations the amounts of our obligations follow in millions total amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period less than year to years to years to years years and thereafter performance bonds and guarantees credit facilities for equity companies stand by letters of credit loan guarantees subtotal of commitment expirations per period purchase obligations capital expenditure obligations total debt minimum rental commitments capital leases interest on long term debt uncertain tax positions subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period total commitments and contingencies at december   million of the million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
capital expenditure obligations  primarily related to our display technologies segment expansions  are included on our balance sheet 
at december    million was included on our balance sheet 
amounts above are stated at their maturity value 
at december   million of the million represents imputed interest 
the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity expiration of the related debt  based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments 
at december   million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions 
of this amount  we are unable to estimate when million of that amount will become payable 
we have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates 
we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning discussed in note investments and note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan 
we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
pensions we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees 
our largest single pension plan is corning s us qualified plan 
at december   this plan accounted for of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and of the related plans assets 
at december   corning adopted sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
the impact of adopting sfas resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of million after tax 
dow corning s adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction to our investment in dow corning and a decrease to stockholders equity of million after tax 
refer to note employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements  and as a result  mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least for  we made voluntary cash contributions of million to our domestic and international pension plans 
for  we made an incremental contribution of million to our domestic and international pension plans 
we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately million to our domestic and international pension plans in environment we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
at december  and  we had accrued approximately million undiscounted and million undiscounted  respectively  for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation 
based upon the information developed to date  we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments follow 
impairment of assets held for use sfas requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
in certain circumstances  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred  an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized 
we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including  for example  employee termination costs 
restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment in accordance with sfas sfas requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
valuation allowances for deferred income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies  and the economic environments in which we do business 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 
if we sustain an appropriate level of profitability  primarily in the us  or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies  adjustments to current allowances will be required and may affect future net income 
refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
probability of litigation outcomes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law  and other case specific issues 
see legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the pcc asbestos liability 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives 
we have reached a tentative plan of settlement on pcc as disclosed in legal proceedings and note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies  including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals 
on december   the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the pcc plan of reorganization due to the scope of the channeling injunction proposed of the two shareholders with respect to other asbestos claims not deriving directly from pcc s products or operations 
several parties  including corning  have moved for reconsideration of the ruling 
we continue to exercise judgment in assessing the likelihood that reconsideration will lead to a revised ruling  or that an alternative plan of reorganization will emerge to address the claims deriving from pcc 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
other possible liabilities sfas and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was  million 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans change in assumption effect on pre tax pension expense effective on december  pbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning s us opeb plans change in assumption effect on pre tax opeb expense effective on december  apbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
revenue recognition in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts  and other factors 
these estimates are supported by historical data 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results 
stock compensation stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include risk free discount rates  expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted  volatility of stock and option prices  expected time between grant date and date of exercise  attrition  performance  and other factors 
these assumptions require us to exercise judgment 
our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and currently available market place data 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rates have the following effects exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is the japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the korean won  the taiwan dollar  and the euro 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in the other income  net component in the consolidated statement of operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments was million in and million in with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount in equity earnings from samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled million for and million for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had open forward contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our outlooks included in management s discussion and analysis assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments
