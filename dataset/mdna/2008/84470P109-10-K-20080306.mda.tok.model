fort worth national bank operates two banking offices in fort worth  one banking office in arlington and a loan production office in austin 
at the time of purchase  fort worth national bank had approximately million in total assets  million in loans and million in deposits 
southside retained many of the key employees of fort worth national bank  and continues to operate fort worth national bank as a separate depository institution under its existing charter 
on august   southside acquired a ownership interest  through a subsidiary of southside bank  in southside financial group  llc 
sfg is engaged in the business of purchasing high yield portfolios of automobile loans on a basis from lenders across the united states 
sfg has retained a management team with extensive experience in the automobile loan industry 
southside bank s initial capital contribution to sfg was  market area we consider our primary market area to be all of smith  gregg  tarrant  travis  cherokee  anderson  kaufman  henderson and wood counties in texas  and to a lesser extent  portions of adjoining counties 
during  we acquired fort worth national bank  which operates with two branches in fort worth  one branch in arlington and a loan production office in austin 
in addition  we opened a full service grocery store branch in hawkins in wood county  as well as our sixth full service grocery store branch in our largest market area  the city of tyler  in smith county 
our expectation is that our presence in all of the market areas we serve will continue to grow in the future 
in addition  we continue to explore new markets in which we believe we can expand successfully 
the principal economic activities in our market areas include retail  distribution  manufacturing  medical services  education and oil and gas industries 
additionally  the industry base includes conventions and tourism  as well as retirement relocation 
these economic activities support a growing regional system of medical service  retail and education centers 
tyler  longview  fort worth  austin and arlington are home to several nationally recognized health care systems that represent all major specialties 
we serve our markets through branch locations  of which are located in grocery stores 
the branches are located in and around tyler  longview  lindale  gresham  jacksonville  bullard  chandler  hawkins  seven points  palestine  forney  gun barrel city  athens  whitehouse  fort worth and arlington 
our television and radio advertising has extended into most of our east texas market areas for several years  providing us name recognition throughout smith  gregg and cherokee counties along with portions of anderson and henderson counties 
we anticipate that continued advertising combined with strategically placed branches should expand our name recognition in this part of the state 
fort worth national bank is a well recognized name in the fort worth and arlington markets 
we also maintain eight motor bank facilities 
our customers may also access various banking services through our automatic teller machines atms and atms owned by others  through debit cards  and through our automated telephone  internet and electronic banking products 
these products allow our customers to apply for loans from their computers  access account information and conduct various other transactions from their telephones and computers 
the banking industry in texas the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment and other factors beyond our control 
during the last ten to fifteen years the texas economy has continued to diversify  decreasing the overall impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices  however  the oil and gas industry is still a significant component of the texas economy 
during  we believe our market areas have been realatively resilient and we have not experinced the effects of the housing led slowdown that impacted other regions of the united states 
we cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 
competition the activities we are engaged in are highly competitive 
financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  insurance companies  brokerage companies and other financial institutions with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions compete vigorously for a share of the financial services market 
during  the number of financial institutions in our market areas increased  a trend that we expect will continue 
brokerage and insurance companies continue to become more competitive in the financial services arena and pose an ever increasing challenge to banks 
legislative changes also greatly affect the level of competition we face 
federal legislation allows credit unions to use their expanded membership capabilities  combined with tax free status  to compete more fiercely for traditional bank business 
the tax free status granted to credit unions provides them a significant competitive advantage 
many of the largest banks operating in texas  including some of the largest banks in the country  have offices in our market areas 
many of these institutions have capital resources  broader geographic markets  and legal lending limits substantially in excess of those available to us 
we face competition from institutions that offer products and services we do not or cannot currently offer 
some institutions we compete with offer interest rate levels on loan and deposit products that we are unwilling to offer due to interest rate risk and overall profitability concerns 
we expect the level of competition to increase 
employees at february   we employed approximately full time equivalent persons 
none of the employees are represented by any unions or similar groups  and we have not experienced any type of strike or labor dispute 
we consider the relationship with our employees to be good

supervision and regulation general banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
consequently  our growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by decisions of management and national and local economic conditions  but also by the statutes administered by  and the regulations and policies of  various governmental authorities 
for bank holding companies  texas state chartered banks  and national banks  these authorities include  but are not limited to  the federal reserve  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the texas department of banking tdb  the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  united states department of treasury the treasury department  the internal revenue service and state taxing authorities 
the primary goals of the bank regulatory system are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress has created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and the banking industry 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to us establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance fund  our depositors and the public  rather than our shareholders and creditors 
the following summarizes certain of the more important relevant laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies  but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed 
holding company regulation the bank holding company act 
as bank holding companies under the bank holding company act of bhca  as amended  southside bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  southside delaware financial corporation  fort worth bancshares  inc and fort worth bancorporation  inc collectively  the holding companies are registered with and subject to regulation by the federal reserve 
the holding companies are required to file annual and other reports with  and furnish information to  the federal reserve  which makes periodic inspections of the holding companies 
the bank holding company act provides that a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve i for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting stock in any bank or bank holding company  ii for the acquisition of substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company or iii in order to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company 
the bhca also provides that  with certain exceptions  a bank holding company may not engage in any activities other than those of banking or managing or controlling banks and other authorized subsidiaries that are engaged in businesses that are closely related to banking or that own or control more than five percent of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or otherwise engaged in businesses that are closely related to banking 
the federal reserve has deemed limited activities such as leasing  consumer and commercial finance  certain financial consulting activities and certain securities brokerage activities to be closely related to banking and therefore permissible for a bank holding company 
the bank holding company act restricts the extension of credit to any bank holding company or non banking subsidiary by a subsidiary bank 
a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of services 
bank anti tying regulations are discussed in greater detail below 
traditionally  the activities of bank holding companies had been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking 
the gramm leach bliley act glba  which became effective on march   amended the bank holding company act and removed certain legal barriers separating the conduct of various types of financial services businesses 
in addition  glba substantially revamped the regulatory scheme within which financial institutions operate 
under glba  bank holding companies meeting certain eligibility requirements may elect to become a financial holding company 
a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature  as well as additional activities that the federal reserve or treasury department determine are financial in nature or incidental or complimentary to financial activities 
under glba  financial activities specifically include insurance brokerage and underwriting  securities underwriting and dealing  merchant banking  investment advisory and lending activities 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company under glba if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdic improvement act prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
in addition  the bank holding company must file a declaration with the federal reserve that the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company 
a bank holding company that falls out of compliance with these requirements may be required to cease engaging in certain of its activities 
under glba  the federal reserve serves as the primary regulator of financial holding companies  with supervisory authority over the parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries 
expanded financial activities of financial holding companies generally will be regulated according to the type of such financial activity banking activities by banking regulators  securities activities by securities regulators and insurance activities by insurance regulators 
as noted  none of the holding companies have elected to become a financial holding company and to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba 
however  there can be no assurance that they will not make such an election in the future 
in addition  glba also imposes additional restrictions and heightened obligations  including disclosure requirements  regarding private information collected by financial institutions 
the holding companies and their subsidiaries including the banks are subject to these obligations 
interstate banking 
federal banking law generally provides that a bank holding company may acquire or establish banks in any state of the united states  subject to certain age and deposit concentration limits 
in approving acquisitions by bank holding companies of banks and companies engaged in banking related activities under sections and of the bhca  the federal reserve considers a number of factors  including expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience  increased competition  or gains in efficiency  as weighed against the risks of possible adverse effects  such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 
the federal reserve is also empowered to differentiate between new activities and activities commenced through the acquisition of a going concern 
in addition  texas banking laws permit a bank holding company that owns stock of a bank located outside the state of texas to acquire a bank or bank holding company located in texas 
this type of acquisition may occur only if the texas bank to be directly or indirectly controlled by the out of state bank holding company has existed and continuously operated as a bank for a period of at least five years 
in any event  a bank holding company may not own or control banks in texas the deposits of which would exceed of the total deposits of all federally insured deposits in texas 
texas banking laws also would not prevent us from making bank acquisitions or establishing banks outside of the state of texas 
we have no present plans to acquire or establish banks outside the state of texas but have not eliminated the possibility of doing so 
capital adequacy 
each of the federal banking agencies  including the federal reserve  the occ  and the fdic  has issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations they supervise  including bank holding companies and banks 
under the risk based capital requirements  the holding companies and the banks are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit of 
at least half of the total capital must be composed of common shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale  unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges  net of deferred income taxes  plus certain mandatorily redeemable capital securities  less nonqualifying intangible assets net of applicable deferred income taxes and certain nonfinancial equity investments 
this is called tier capital 
the remainder may consist of qualifying subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments  qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses 
this is called tier capital 
tier capital and tier capital combined are referred to as total regulatory capital 
the federal reserves also expects bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of 
the federal reserve requires bank holding companies that engage in trading activities to adjust their risk based capital ratios to take into consideration market risks that may result from movements in market prices of covered trading positions in trading accounts  or from foreign exchange or commodity positions  whether or not in trading accounts  including changes in interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates or commodity prices 
any capital required to be maintained under these provisions may consist of a new tier capital consisting of forms of short term subordinated debt 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies  including the federal reserve  also has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations 
these requirements provide that banking organizations that meet certain criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and good earnings  and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of tier capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 
institutions not meeting these criteria  as well as institutions with supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses  are expected to maintain a minimum tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to to basis points above that stated minimum 
holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the federal reserve also continues to consider a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity 
in addition  the federal reserve  the occ and the fdic have adopted risk based capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
the capital guidelines provide that an institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization s capital adequacy 
the agencies also require banks and bank holding companies to adjust their regulatory capital to take into consideration the risk associated with certain recourse obligations  direct credit subsidies  residual interest and other positions in securitized transactions that expose banking organizations to credit risk 
the ratios of tier capital  total capital to risk adjusted assets  and leverage capital of the company and the banks as of december   are shown in the following table 
capital adequacy ratios regulatory minimums regulatory minimums to be well capitalized southside bancshares  inc southside bank fort worth national bank risk based capital ratios tier capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio common shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale  unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges  net of deferred income taxes  plus certain mandatorily redeemable capital securities  less nonqualifying intangible assets net of applicable deferred income taxes  and certain nonfinancial equity investments  computed as a ratio of risk weighted assets  as defined in the risk based capital guidelines 
the sum of tier capital  a qualifying portion of the allowance for credit losses  qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities  computed as a ratio of risk weighted assets  as defined in the risk based capital guidelines 
tier capital computed as a percentage of fourth quarter average assets less nonqualifying intangibles and certain nonfinancial equity investments 
the federal banking agencies  including the occ and the fdic  are required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
the law establishes five capital categories for insured depository institutions for this purpose well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized under these standards  an institution must maintain a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  a leverage capital ratio of or greater  and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
the banks meet the criteria for well capitalized 
federal law also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital categories  with progressively more severe restrictions on operations  management and capital distributions according to the category in which an institution is placed 
failure to meet capital requirements may also cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital 
federal law also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation  and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards 
in addition to the prompt corrective action directives  failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities  termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and  under certain conditions  the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
the regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital 
specifically  a federal banking agency may  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category if the institution is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice 
the fdic may not  however  reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized 
federal reserve policy requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial strength and to take measures to preserve and protect bank subsidiaries in situations where additional investments in a troubled bank may not otherwise be warranted 
in addition  where a bank holding company has more than one bank or thrift subsidiary  each of the bank holding company s subsidiary depository institutions are responsible for any losses to the fdic as a result of an affiliated depository institution s failure or anticipated failure 
as a result  a bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries in the form of capital notes or other instruments which qualify as capital under regulatory rules 
any such loans from the holding company to its subsidiary banks likely will be unsecured and subordinated to the bank s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank 
dividends 
as a bank holding company that does not  as an entity  currently engage in separate business activities of a material nature  the holding companies ability to pay cash dividends depends upon the cash dividends received from the banks 
we must pay essentially all of our operating expenses from funds we receive from the banks 
therefore  shareholders may receive dividends from us only to the extent that funds are available after payment of our operating expenses 
in general  the federal reserve discourages bank holding companies from paying dividends except out of operating earnings  and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
we are also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that we maintain an adequate level of capital as described above and serve as a source of strength for our subsidiaries 
change in bank control act 
under the change in bank control act cbca  persons who intend to acquire control of a bank holding company  either directly or indirectly  must give days prior notice to the federal reserve 
control would exist when an acquiring party directly or indirectly has control of at least of our voting securities or the power to direct management or policies 
under federal reserve regulations  a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where  after the transaction  the acquiring party has ownership control or the power to vote at least but less than of our voting securities 
the attorney general of the united states may  within days after approval by the federal reserve board of an acquisition under section of the bhca  bring an action challenging such acquisition under the federal antitrust laws  in which case the effectiveness of such approval is stayed pending a final ruling by the courts 
failure of the attorney general to challenge a section acquisition and the absence of a specific right of action to challenge section or cbca acquisitions do not  however  exempt the holding company from complying with both state and federal antitrust laws after the acquisition is consummated 
the federal reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute knowing or reckless violations of laws or regulations  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
these penalties can be as high as one million dollars for each day the activity continues 
bank regulation southside bank is chartered under the laws of the state of texas  is an insured institution and is a member of the fdic s deposit insurance fund 
it is not a member of the federal reserve system 
as such  it is subject to various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of texas  and to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the tdb and the fdic 
the tdb and the fdic have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking statutes and regulations 
these requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits  restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of southside bank 
fort worth national bank is a national bank  and as such is subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the occ 
the fdic also has back up enforcement authority over fort worth national bank 
ongoing supervision is provided through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management s ability to identify  assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations 
as a result  the scope of routine examinations of the banks is rather extensive 
to facilitate supervision  the banks are required to file periodic reports with the regulatory agencies  and much of this information is made available to the public by the agencies 
deposit insurance 
the banks deposits are generally insured up to  per depositor and up to  for certain retirement accounts by the fdic s deposit insurance fund 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations and to require reporting 
the fdic assesses insurance premiums on a bank s deposits at a variable rate depending on the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the bank 
the fdic determines the deposit insurance assessment rates on the basis of the bank s capital classification and supervisory evaluations 
for  the minimum assessment rate is basis points for the institutions the fdic perceives to pose the least threat to the deposit insurance fund  and basis points for the highest risk institutions 
our deposits insurance assessments may increase or decrease depending upon the risk assessment classification to which we are assigned by the fdic 
any increase in insurance assessments could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
in addition to its role as insurer  the fdic is the primary federal regulator of state chartered banks  including southside bank  that are not members of a federal reserve bank

firrea provides that certain types of persons affiliated with financial institutions can be fined by the federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction over a depository institution with federal deposit insurance such as the banks up to million per day for each violation of certain regulations related primarily to lending to and transactions with executive officers  directors  and principal shareholders  including the interests of these individuals 
other violations may result in civil money penalties of  to  per day or in criminal fines and penalties 
in addition  the fdic has been granted enhanced authority to withdraw or to suspend deposit insurance in certain cases 
activities and investments of insured state chartered and national banks 
the activities and investments of national banks are limited to those set forth in the national bank act and in statutory interpretations of the occ 
the fdic generally limits the activities and equity investments of state nonmember banks to those that are permissible for national banks 
under regulations dealing with equity investments  an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type  or in an amount  that is not permissible for a national bank 
however  a state nonmember bank may seek fdic approval to engage in activities that are not permissible for a national bank

fdic regulations implementing the federal deposit insurance act fdia provide that an insured state chartered bank may not  directly  or indirectly through a subsidiary  engage as principal in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the fdic has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the insurance fund of which it is a member and the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements 
any insured state chartered bank or savings bank directly or indirectly engaged in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank must cease the impermissible activity 
loans to one borrower 
the maximum aggregate amount of loans that southside bank will be permitted to make under texas law to any one borrower  including related entities  is of tier capital 
the limit for fort worth national bank under the national bank act is of total capital  plus an additional for loans secured by readily marketable securities 
regulation of lending activities

remedies to the borrower or consumer and penalties to us are provided if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations 
the scope and requirements of these laws and regulations have expanded significantly in recent years 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act of facta substantially amended the fair credit reporting act to impose new duties on institutions such as the banks that furnish or receive information from credit reporting agencies 
the new duties relate primarily to situations in which a consumer could become the victim of an identity theft 
the fdic and other federal agencies are still in the process of developing regulations implementing the facta provisions 
brokered deposits 
the banks also may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits  depending on their capital classification 
well capitalized banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits  but all banks that are not well capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 
anti tying regulations 
under the bank holding company act and federal reserve regulations  a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers 
in general  a bank may not extend credit  lease  sell property  or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these products or services on the condition that either the customer obtain or provide some additional credit  property  or services from or to the bank  the bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof  or that the customer may not obtain some other credit  property  or services from a competitor  except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended 
certain arrangements are permissible a bank may offer combined balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products  and certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule

all dividends paid by fort worth national bank are paid to the company  as sole indirect shareholder of fort worth national bank  through fort worth bancorporation  inc and fort worth bancshares  inc our general dividend policy is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining liquidity and preserving applicable capital ratios and servicing obligations 
the dividend policies of the banks are subject to the discretion of their respective boards of directors and will depend upon such factors as future earnings  financial conditions  cash needs  capital adequacy  compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and general business conditions

we generally may not pay a dividend reducing our capital and surplus without the prior approval of the texas banking commissioner 
all dividends must be paid out of net profits then on hand  after deducting expenses  including losses and provisions for loan losses 
the fdic has the right to prohibit the payment of dividends by us where the payment is deemed to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
we are also prohibited from paying dividends that will reduce our capital below the well capitalized level as defined by the fdic  and as a general matter  prefer to maintain a strong capital position which necessarily limits the amount of dividends we are prepared to declare and pay 
the ability of fort worth national bank to pay dividends is subject to similar restrictions 
fort worth national bank may not  without prior occ approval  pay a dividend that would exceed the sum of net income in calendar year to date plus retained net earnings of the immediately previous two years 
as a policy matter  the occ prefers that national banks pay dividends solely out of net profits then on hand 
the exact amount of future dividends on the banks will be a function of the profitability of the banks in general which cannot be accurately estimated or assured  applicable tax rates in effect from year to year and the discretion of their respective boards of directors 
in addition  fdic regulations generally prohibits fdic insured depository institutions  such the banks  from making any capital distribution including payment of dividends or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
various other legislation  including proposals to revise the bank regulatory system and to limit or expand the investments that a depository institution may make with insured funds  is from time to time introduced in congress 
the tdb  the occ  and the fdic will examine the banks periodically for compliance with various regulatory requirements 
such examinations  however  are for the protection of the dif and for depositors and not for the protection of investors and shareholders 
transactions with affiliates 
the holding companies are legal entities separate and distinct from the banks and their other subsidiaries 
various legal limitations restrict the banks from lending or otherwise advancing funds to the holding companies or their non bank subsidiaries 
the holding companies and the banks are subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w 
generally  sections a and b i limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  ii limit such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus  and ii require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans to an affiliate  the purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate  the purchase of assets from an affiliate  the issuance of a guarantee for the benefit of an affiliate  and similar transactions 
most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the nature of the collateral 
in addition  any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
the banks are also restricted in the loans that it may make to its executive officers and directors  the executive officers and directors of the company  any owner of or more of its stock or the stock of the company  and certain entities affiliated with any such person 
section b also prohibits a bank from purchasing low quality assets from the bank s affiliates  and requires that all of a bank s extensions of credit to an affiliate be appropriately secured by acceptable collateral  generally united states government or agency securities 
under sections a and b of the federal reserve act  an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution is not treated as an affiliate of a bank for purposes of sections a and b unless it engages in activities not permissible for a national bank to engage in directly 
insider loans 
under regulation o of the federal reserve  the bank s are restricted in the loans that they may make to their executive officers and directors  the executive officers and directors of southside bancshares  inc  any owner of or more of its stock or the stock of southside bancshares  inc  and certain entities affiliated with any such person 
standards for safety and soundness 
the fdia requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe  by regulation or guideline  operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv interest rate risk exposure  and v asset growth 
the agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality  earnings  and stock valuation  as well as standards for compensation  fees and benefits 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness guidelines to implement these required standards 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
under the regulations  if the fdic or the occ  as applicable  determines that the banks fail to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the bank in question to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard  as required by the fdic or the occ 
the final regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans 
community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act  we have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the needs of our entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the community reinvestment act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit our discretion to develop the types of products and services that we believe are best suited to our particular community 
current cra regulations rate institutions based on their actual performance in meeting community credit needs 
cra performance is evaluated by the fdic and the occ  the banks primary federal regulators  using a lending test  an investment test  and a service test 
the regulators also will consider i demographic data about the community  ii the institution s capacity and constraints  iii the institution s product offerings and business strategy  and iv data on the prior performance of the institution and similarly situated lenders 
on a periodic basis  the fdic or the occ  as applicable  is charged with preparing a written evaluation of our record of meeting the credit needs of the entire community and assigning a rating 
our regulatory agencies will take that record into account in their evaluation of any application made by us for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
an unsatisfactory community reinvestment act rating may be used as the basis to deny an application 
in addition  as discussed above  a bank holding company may not become a financial holding company unless each of its subsidiary banks has a community reinvestment act rating of at least satisfactory 
we were last examined for compliance with the community reinvestment act on march  and received a rating of outstanding 
consumer regulation 
activities of the banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers  including the fair credit reporting act fcra  equal credit opportunity act ecoa  and truth in lending act tila 
these laws and regulations include provisions that limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the banks  govern the banks disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  require the banks to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether they are fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves  prohibit the banks from discriminating on the basis of race  creed or other prohibited factors when they make decisions to extend credit  require that the banks safeguard the personal nonpublic information of their customers  provide annual notices to consumers regarding the usage and sharing of such information  and limit disclosure of such information to third parties except under specific circumstances  and govern the manner in which the banks may collect consumer debts 
the deposit operations of the banks are also subject to laws and regulations that require the banks to adequately disclose the interest rates and other terms of consumer deposit accounts  impose a duty on the banks to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribe procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  and govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts with the banks and the rights and liabilities of customers who use automated teller machines and other electronic banking services 
usa patriot act anti money laundering 
following the events of september   president bush  on october   signed into law the united and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of also known as the usa patriot act  the law enhances the powers of the federal government and law enforcement organizations to combat terrorism  organized crime and money laundering 
the usa patriot act significantly amends and expands the application of the bank secrecy act  including enhanced measures regarding customer identity  new suspicious activity reporting rules and enhanced anti money laundering programs 
under the act  each financial institution is required to establish and maintain anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs  which include  at a minimum  the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test programs 
in addition  the act requires the bank regulatory agencies to consider the record of a bank or bank holding company in combating money laundering activities in their evaluation of bank and bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions 
furthermore  financial institutions must maintain anti money laundering programs that include established internal policies  procedures  and controls  a designated compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and testing of the program by an independent audit function 
the company and the banks are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and knowing your customer in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions  and recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 
anti money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the usa patriot act  which was renewed in bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 
the regulatory authorities have been active in imposing cease and desist orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations 
privacy and data security 
the glb act imposed new requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy 
the glb act generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure 
financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually 
financial institutions  however  will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the glb act 
the glb act also directed federal regulators  including the fdic  to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information 
the banks are subject to such standards  as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach 
under federal law  the company must disclose its privacy policy to consumers  permit consumers to opt out of having non public customer information disclosed to third parties  and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary 
states may adopt more extensive privacy protections 
the banks and the company are similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal 
customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused 
branch banking 
pursuant to the texas finance code  all banks located in texas are authorized to branch statewide 
accordingly  a bank located anywhere in texas has the ability  subject to regulatory approval  to establish branch facilities near any of our facilities and within our market area 
if other banks were to establish branch facilities near our facilities  it is uncertain whether these branch facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  congress adopted the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of that statute provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching  subject to certain aging and deposit concentration limits that may be imposed under applicable state laws 
texas law permits interstate branching in two manners  with certain exceptions 
first  a financial institution with its main office outside of texas may establish a branch in the state of texas by acquiring a financial institution located in texas that is at least five years old  so long as the resulting institution and its affiliates would not hold more than of the total deposits in the state after the acquisition 
in addition  a financial institution with its main office outside of texas generally may establish a branch in the state of texas on a de novo basis if the financial institution s main office is located in a state that would permit texas institutions to establish a branch on a de novo basis in that state 
these limitations apply to both of the banks 
the fdic has adopted regulations under the reigle neal act to prohibit an out of state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production 
these regulations include guidelines to insure that interstate branches operated by an out of state bank in a host state are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the out of state bank 
enforcement authority 
the federal banking laws also contain civil and criminal penalties available for use by the appropriate regulatory agency against certain institution affiliated parties primarily including management  employees and agents of a financial institution  as well as independent contractors such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution s affairs and who caused or are likely to cause more than minimum financial loss to or a significant adverse affect on the institution  who knowingly or recklessly violate a law or regulation  breach a fiduciary duty or engage in unsafe or unsound practices 
these practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the submission of inaccurate reports 
these laws authorize the appropriate banking agency to issue cease and desist orders that may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnification or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets or take other action as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate 
the fdic and the occ  respectively  are the appropriate regulatory agencies for southside bank and fort worth national bank  the federal reserve is the appropriate regulatory agency for the holding companies 
governmental monetary policies 
the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  control of borrowings  open market operations  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks  deposits and assets of foreign branches  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates which member banks may pay on time and savings deposits are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve 
those monetary policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of all bank loans  investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits 
the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our future business and earnings  therefore  cannot be predicted accurately 
annual audits 
every bank with total assets in excess of million  such as us  must have an annual independent audit made of the bank s financial statements by a certified public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the fdic 
all of the above laws and regulations add to the cost of our operations and thus have a negative impact on profitability 
it should be noted that there has been a tremendous expansion experienced in recent years by financial service providers that are not subject to the same rules and regulations as are applicable to the holding companies 
management cannot predict what other legislation might be enacted or what other regulations might be adopted and the effects thereof on us 
usury laws 
texas usury laws limit the rate of interest that may be charged by state banks 
certain federal laws provide a limited preemption of texas usury laws 
the maximum rate of interest that we may charge on direct business loans under texas law varies between per annum and i per annum for business and agricultural loans above  or ii per annum for other direct loans 
texas floating usury ceilings are tied to the week united states treasury bill auction rate 
other ceilings apply to open end credit card loans and dealer paper we purchase 
a federal statute removes interest ceilings under usury laws for our loans that are secured by first liens on residential real property 
these restrictions generally apply to both of the banks 
economic environment 
the monetary policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve  have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
the federal reserve regulates the national supply of bank credit 
among the means available to the federal reserve are open market operations in united states government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  changes in reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits  and loans and limitations on interest rates which member banks may pay on time or demand deposits 
these methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  changes in interest rates  changes in the yield curve  changes in market risk spreads  and a prolonged inverted yield curve could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  net interest rate spreads and net interest rate margins  our ability to enter into instruments to hedge against interest rate risk  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned net interest income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion related to our management of interest rate risk 
we are subject to credit quality risks and our credit policies may not be sufficient to avoid losses 
we are subject to the risk of losses resulting from the failure of borrowers  guarantors and related parties to pay interest and principal amounts on their loans 
although we maintain credit policies and credit underwriting  monitoring and collection procedures that management believes are sufficient to manage these risks  these policies and procedures may not prevent losses  particularly during periods in which the local  regional or national economy suffers a general decline 
if borrowers fail to repay their loans  our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
our interest rate risk  liquidity  market value of securities and profitability are subject to risks associated with the successful implementation of our leverage strategy 
we implemented a leverage strategy in for the purpose of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of our capital 
the effectiveness of our leverage strategy  and therefore our profitability  may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including reduced net interest margin and spread  adverse market value changes to the investment and mortgage backed and related securities  incorrect modeling results due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments  the length of interest rate cycles  and the slope of the interest rate yield curve 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain wholesale funding to profitably and properly fund the leverage program 
if our leverage strategy is flawed or poorly implemented  we may incur significant losses 
see the section captioned leverage strategy in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a continued downturn in the real estate market  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
in addition to the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of the borrower in each case  often loans are secured with real estate collateral 
at december   approximately of our loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral 
the real estate in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
beginning in the third quarter of  there were well publicized developments in the credit markets  beginning with a decline in the sub prime mortgage lending market  which later extended to the markets for collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage backed securities and the lending markets generally 
this decline has resulted in restrictions in the resale markets for non conforming loans and has had an adverse effect on retail mortgage lending operations in many markets 
we believe our markets have been relatively resilient and we have not experienced effects associated with these market trends  however  a continued decline in the credit markets generally could adversely effect our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to extend credit or sell loans in the secondary market 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in our primary markets specifically could significantly impair the value of collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
furthermore  it is likely that  in a declining real estate market  we would be required to further increase our allowance for loan losses 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses  our profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
we have a high concentration of loans directly related to the medical community in our market area  primarily in smith and gregg counties 
a negative change adversely impacting the medical community  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on the medical community 
the primary source of repayment for loans in the medical community is cash flow from continuing operations 
however  changes in the amount the government pays the medical community through the various government health insurance programs could adversely impact the medical community  which in turn could result in higher default rates by borrowers in the medical industry 
increased regulation of the medical community could also negatively impact profitability and cash flow in the medical community 
it is likely that  should there be any significant adverse impact to the medical community  our profitability and financial condition would also be adversely impacted 
our allowance for probable loan losses may be insufficient 
we maintain an allowance for probable loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense 
this allowance represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside our control  may require an increase in the allowance for probable loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for probable loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for probable loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for probable loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for probable loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned loan loss experience and allowance for loan losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of texas 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of texas and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the texas areas of tyler  longview  lindale  whitehouse  chandler  gresham  athens  palestine  jacksonville  bullard  forney  seven points  gun barrel city  fort worth  austin and arlington 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services  as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets we operate 
additionally  various out of state banks have entered or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which we currently operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes  continued consolidation and recent trends in the credit and mortgage lending markets 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand our market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
southside bancshares  inc  primarily through southside bank  fort worth national bank and certain non bank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices and dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while our policies and procedures are designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
