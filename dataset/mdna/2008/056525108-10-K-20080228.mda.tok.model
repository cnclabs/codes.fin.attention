item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description and overview the company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of products incorporating liquid flow measurement and control technologies  developed both internally and in conjunction with other technology companies 
its products are used to measure and control the flow of liquids in a wide variety of applications 
the company s product lines fall into two general categories  utility and industrial flow measurement 
the utility category is comprised of two primary product lines residential and commercial water meters that are used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues 
the market for these product lines is north america  primarily the united states  because these meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the american water works association 
the utility flow measurement products constitute a majority of the company s sales 
industrial product line sales comprise the remainder of the company s sales and include precision valves  electromagnetic inductive flow meters  impeller flow meters  and turbine and positive displacement industrial flow meters 
rounding out the industrial product line are automotive fluid meters for the measurement of various types of automotive fluids 
residential and commercial water meters have generally been classified as either manual read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology 
a meter that is manually read consists of the water meter and a register displaying the meter reading 
meters equipped with radio technology convert the mechanical measurement to a digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for the utility s billing computer 
drive by systems are referred to as automatic meter reading amr systems and have been the primary amr technology deployed by water utilities over the past decade  providing cost effective and accurate billing data 
in a drive by amr system  a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes collects meter reading data 
of growing interest to water utilities are fixed network advanced metering infrastructure ami systems 
these systems do not rely on a drive by data collector  but rather incorporate a network of data collectors that are always active or listening to the radio transmission from the utility s meters 
not only do fixed network systems eliminate the need for meter readers  but they have the ability to provide the utility with more frequent and diverse data at specified intervals 
the company s response to these market requirements will be detailed further in the business trends section 
the company s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and mix of products  with the company generally earning higher margins on meters equipped with amr or ami technology 
in addition to selling its proprietary amr ami products including the orion drive by amr technology and the galaxy fixed network ami system  the company also remarkets the itron drive by amr product under a license and distribution agreement 
the company s proprietary amr ami products generally result in higher margins than the non proprietary amr ami products that the company remarkets 
one distinctive advantage of the orion amr technology is that while it is fundamentally a drive by amr system  the proprietary receiver technology of orion has been licensed to other technology providers  including those providing amr ami products that communicate over power lines  broadband networks  municipal wifi and proprietary radio frequency networks 
utility meter and amr ami product sales are generally derived from the water meter replacement requirements of customers  along with their plans for adoption and deployment of new technology 
to a much lesser extent  housing starts also contribute to the base of new product sales 
over the last decade there has been a growing trend in the conversion to amr ami from manually read water meters 
this conversion rate is accelerating and contributing to an increased base of business available to meter and amr ami producers 
it is currently estimated that approximately of water meters installed in the united states have been converted to amr ami systems 
badger meter s strategy is to solve customers metering needs with its proprietary meter reading systems or other systems available through its alliance partners in the marketplace 
the industrial products generally serve a variety of niche flow measurement applications across a broad range of industries 
some of the flow measurement technologies  such as positive displacement and turbine flow measurement  now used industrially have been derived from utility meter technologies 
other technologies are very specific to industrial applications 
in addition  a growing requirement is for industrial meters to be equipped with specialized communication protocols that control the entire flow measurement process 
serving both the utility and industrial flow measurement market enables the company to use its wide variety of technology for specific flow measurement and control applications  as well as to utilize existing capacity and spread fixed costs over a larger sales base 
business trends ami is the growing standard of technology deployment in the electric industry 
ami provides an electric utility with two way communication to monitor and control electrical devices at the customer s site 
ami deployments are always fixed network technologies 
although the company does not participate in the electric market  the trend toward ami is now affecting the water and gas utility amr market as well 
specifically  in the water industry  fixed network ami enables the water utility to capture interval readings from each meter on a daily basis 
while two way communication is extremely limited in water fixed network ami  utilities are contemplating how two way networks could benefit them 
as noted above  the company markets the orion drive by amr product line as well as the galaxy fixed network ami product line 
the company is positioned to sell either product as this trend continues 
since both products have comparable margins  any acceleration or slowdown in this trend is not expected to have a significant impact on the company 
although there is growing interest in fixed network communication by water utilities  the vast majority of utilities currently installing amr ami are selecting drive by amr technologies for their applications 
the company s orion technology has experienced rapid acceptance in the united states 
by the end of  more than  water utilities had selected orion as their amr solution of choice 
there are approximately  water utilities in the united states and the company estimates that less than of them have converted to an amr technology 
it is anticipated that even with growing interest in fixed network ami  drive by amr will continue to be the primary product of choice by water utilities for a number of years 
drive by amr technology is simply the lowest cost form of amr currently available to water utilities 
prior to the company s introduction of its own proprietary orion products  itron water utility related products were a significant contributor to the company s results 
itron products are sold under an agreement between the company and itron  inc that expires in early and the company is currently discussing with itron an extension of the agreement 
the company s orion products directly compete with itron water amr products and  in recent years  many of the company s customers have selected orion products 
in  orion sales increased while itron licensed product sales decreased compared to the company expects this trend to continue  although it also believes that itron licensed products will remain a significant component of utility sales 
to date  decreases in sales of itron licensed products have been offset by increases in sales of orion products  which produce a higher gross margin than itron licensed products 
as a result  the company does not expect this trend to have a material negative impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
during  the company carefully evaluated strategic alternatives for its subsidiaries in nancy  france  including restructuring  sale or shutdown 
in the third quarter of  the company began the process under french law to obtain the requisite governmental and regulatory approvals to close the operation 
on october   the decision was finalized 
from that date through  all assets and liabilities were liquidated resulting in total after tax charges of million  of which million of charges  net of the income tax benefit  were recognized in all results associated with the company s french operations have been removed from continuing operations and are presented as results of discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
all remaining comments in this section relate to continuing operations 
results of operations net sales badger meter s net sales of million increased million  or  for compared to the increase was the result of sales increases in industrial products  while utility sales were approximately the same between years  as further explained below 
residential and commercial water meter net sales represented of total net sales in compared with in these sales of million increased just  in compared to overall volume declines in bronze manual read meters  meters with itron licensed technology and commercial meters were offset by volume increases in plastic meters and in meters with the company s orion amr technology 
in  sales of orion products increased nearly  due mostly to volume increases 
by contrast  sales of itron related products declined nearly due to lower volumes 
industrial sales are affected by economic conditions  domestically and internationally  in each of the markets served by the various product lines 
industrial product net sales increased in over levels 
in total  the sales of industrial products represented of total net sales in compared to in industrial product net sales increased million to million in compared with million in driven primarily by higher sales of automotive fluid products  precision valves and other industrial products 
international sales are comprised primarily of sales of small valves  electromagnetic meters and automotive fluid meters in europe  sales of electromagnetic meters with water meters and related technologies in latin america  and sales of valves and other metering products throughout the world 
in europe  sales are made primarily in euros 
other international sales are made in us dollars or local currencies 
international sales increased to million in from million in due principally to higher sales of industrial products in europe 
foreign exchange effects also contributed to the sales increase  notably the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
badger meter s net sales of million increased million  or  for compared to the increase was the net result of sales increases in most of the company s product lines driven primarily by increased volumes of product sold 
residential and commercial water meter net sales represented of total net sales in compared with in these sales increased million  or  in to million from million in unit volume increased in residential and commercial manual read water meters as well as meters utilizing amr technologies 
amr technologies carry a higher price  which also contributed to the increase in net sales 
in addition  net sales increased in part due to a significant increase over levels for the sales volumes of orion  the company s proprietary amr system  which has higher margins than other amr products 
industrial product net sales increased in over levels 
in total  the industrial products represented of total net sales in compared to in industrial product net sales increased million  or to million in compared with million in driven primarily by higher sales of automotive fluid and electromagnetic meters 
international sales increased to million in from million in due principally to higher sales of industrial products in europe 
gross margins gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
gross margins increased between and as a result of increases in amr volumes driven by sales of orion products as well as price increases put into effect to recover higher cost of materials  particularly copper  the main component of the brass housings used to make meters 
gross margins decreased between and due to higher cost of materials  particularly copper 
this was mitigated somewhat by the higher mix of amr versus manual read meters  a higher percentage of orion amr technology versus other non proprietary amr products  and price increases initiated in mid and continuing through operating expenses selling  engineering and administration costs increased in compared to and were the net result of higher legal fees associated with successfully completed litigation  increased reserves for uncollectible receivables  increased product development costs and normal inflationary pressures offset by continued cost controls 
selling  engineering and administration costs increased in over levels due to normal inflationary increases and increased costs associated with higher sales 
interest expense interest expense was approximately the same between and interest expense was approximately million less in than in due primarily to lower overall debt balances 
income taxes income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate between and was due to an increase in the federal income tax deduction available to manufacturers for qualified production activities section deduction and the settlement of certain state tax audits 
the increase in the effective tax rate between and resulted from the company s inability to claim the section deduction due to the tax positions taken related to the company s french operations 
earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations as a result of the above mentioned items  earnings from continuing operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share from continuing operations were  and  respectively  for the same periods 
liquidity and capital resources the main sources of liquidity for the company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity 
cash provided by operations in was million versus million in the increase in cash provided by operations between years was due principally to improved earnings 
cash provided by operations in was million versus million in the decline was due principally to lower earnings 
the increase in cash at december  over the balance at december  is a function of the timing of receipts near the end of receivables increased between december  and due primarily to higher fourth quarter sales 
inventories increased due to higher raw material costs and the timing of inventory purchases 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million between december  and primarily due to increases in prepaid service contracts 
the december  and balances also include million of remaining book value related to the rio rico  arizona facility that is listed for sale 
capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures 
included in capital expenditures for is approximately million related to the construction of a second facility in mexico compared to million of construction in for new facilities in mexico and germany 
the company expects to spend approximately million in to complete construction of the second facility in mexico 
the company believes capacity exists to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures after the completion of this facility 
other assets increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is due to the purchase of additional manufacturing software to enhance the business systems 
short term debt decreased million in and total outstanding long term debt both the current and long term portions decreased million 
these reductions of debt were due to cash generated from operations 
none of the company s debt carries financial covenants or is secured 
the million increase in payables between years is primarily the result of the timing of purchases 
warranty and after sale costs decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to fewer warranty costs due to improved manufacturing processes for products introduced in recent years 
income and other taxes increased to million at december  from million at december  at december   the company recorded its net federal income tax position refundable income tax net of the related reserves for unrecognized tax benefits as a receivable 
in  the company received payment of the refundable tax amounts and reclassified the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits to the income and other taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
the accrued non pension postretirement liability declined million to million at december  from million at december  the decline is principally due to changes in the funded status of the company s post employment benefit plans 
common stock and capital in excess of par value both increased during due primarily to the exercise of stock options  stock compensation expense and the tax benefit on stock options 
treasury stock decreased due to shares issued in connection the company s dividend reinvestment program 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by million primarily due to changes in the funded status of the company s pension plan and other post employment benefits 
badger meter s financial condition remains strong 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  available borrowing capacity including million of unused credit lines  and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  future capital expenditures and development of new products 
the company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and from time to time may convert short term debt into long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements at december  prior to that date  the company guaranteed the debt of the badger meter officers voting trust bmovt  from which the bmovt obtained loans from a bank on behalf of the officers of the company in order to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
the officers loan amounts were secured by the company s shares that were purchased with the loan proceeds 
the entire outstanding loan balance was repaid at december  and the bmovt was dissolved because it no longer fulfilled its original purpose of providing officers with loans to purchase common stock 
contractual obligations the company guarantees the outstanding debt of the essop that is recorded in short term debt  offset by a similar amount of unearned compensation that has been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
the loan amount is secured by shares of the company s common stock 
payments of  and  in and  respectively  reduced the loan to  at december  the terms of the loan allow variable payments of principal with the final principal and interest payment due on april   at which time it is expected to be renewed 
the following table includes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  there are no undisclosed guarantees 
payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands current portion and long term debt interest on current portion and long term debt construction of facilities essop operating leases total contractual obligations other than items included in the preceding table  as of december   the company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment  which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the most recent actuarial measurement date  no pension plan contributions are anticipated in and postretirement medical claims are paid as they are submitted 
postretirement medical claims are anticipated to be  in based on actuarial estimates  however  these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the company is self insured 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s more significant estimates relate primarily to several judgmental reserves allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for obsolete inventories  warranty and after sale costs reserve  and the health care reserve for claims incurred  as well as claims incurred but not reported 
each of these judgmental reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the company s disclosure committee and the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors 
the basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing the anticipated exposure for each account  and then selecting the most likely amount based upon historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this method has been used for all years in the presented financials and has been used consistently throughout each year 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts varies by type of reserve 
for the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve  significant past due balances are individually reviewed for collectibility  while the balance of accounts are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical write off ratios 
the calculation for the obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist 
the calculation for warranty and after sale costs reserve uses criteria that include known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claim experience and current warranty trends 
the health care reserve for claims incurred  but not reported is determined by using medical cost trend analyses  reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts 
the changes in the balances of these reserves at december  compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant 
while the company continually tries to improve its estimates  no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in the company also uses estimates in three other significant areas 
estimates are used in developing pension and other postretirement obligations and costs 
the actuarial valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs rely on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates 
another area where estimates are used is in calculating stock based compensation costs 
the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted  adjusted for forfeitures 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures  which could have an impact on the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
the third area employing estimates is income taxes 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company evaluates and updates all of these assumptions annually 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
other matters the company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations 
currently  the company is in the process of resolving matters relative to two landfill sites where it has been named as one of many potentially responsible parties 
these sites are impacted by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and other environmental laws and regulations 
at this time  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based on the company s assessment of its limited past involvement with these sites as well as the substantial involvement of other named third parties in these matters 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
a future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the company  or with respect to off site disposal locations used by the company  could result in future costs to the company and such amounts could be material 
expenditures during  and for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations were not material 
like other companies in recent years  the company has been named as a defendant in numerous multi claimant multi defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos  manufactured by third parties  and integrated into a very limited number of the company s industrial products 
the company is vigorously defending itself against these claims 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based in part on the fact that no claimant has demonstrated exposure to products manufactured or sold by the company and that a number of cases have been voluntarily dismissed 
market risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks 
the company operates in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense 
the company believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and amr ami systems for water utilities 
a number of the company s competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources 
competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products  particularly those that provide amr ami connectivity solutions 
in addition  the market s level of acceptance of the company s newer products may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result of significant research and development activities  the company enjoys favorable patent positions for several of its products 
the company s ability to generate operating income and to increase profitability depends somewhat on the general health of the united states and foreign economies  the overall industrial activity  and to a lesser extent  housing starts in the united states 
in addition  changes in governmental laws and regulations  particularly laws dealing with the use of lead or rules affecting the use and or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for amr ami products may impact the results of operations 
these factors are largely beyond the company s control and depend on the economic condition and regulatory environment of the geographic region of the company s operations 
the company has evaluated its worldwide operations to determine if any risks and uncertainties exist that could severely impact its operations in the near term 
the company does not believe that there are any significant near term risks 
however  the company does rely on single suppliers for certain castings and components in several of its product lines 
although alternate sources of supply exist for these items  loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term 
the company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers  purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products include metal or alloys such as bronze  which uses copper as its main component  aluminum  stainless steel  cast iron  brass and stellite  plastic resins  glass  microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies and components 
the price and availability of raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions  including supply and demand factors that are difficult to anticipate and cannot be controlled by the company 
commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the company s forecasted usage 
the company s foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers 
the company uses lines of credit with us and european banks to offset currency exposure related to european receivables and other monetary assets 
as of december  and  the company s foreign currency net monetary assets were substantially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure to the results of operations 
the company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes 
the company s short term debt on december  was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value 
fixed rate debt was principally a us dollar term loan with a interest rate and a euro dollar revolving term loan with a interest rate 
for the short term floating rate debt  future annual interest costs will fluctuate based upon short term interest rates 
for the short term debt on hand on december   the effect of a change in interest rates is approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk information required by this item is set forth in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading market risks in this annual report on form k
