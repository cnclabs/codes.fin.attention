overview we design  develop and market analog and mixed signal semiconductors that enable and enhance the features and capabilities of portable and other consumer products 
historically  our core products have been color display drivers with integrated controllers  but beginning in we expanded our product offerings to include portable consumer audio amplifiers and digital to analog converters or dacs  light emitting diode or led drivers  power management integrated circuits and touch sensor technology semiconductor products 
we began operations in 
table of contents and began commercially shipping our products in the third quarter of we focus on the design  development and marketing of our products and outsource all of the fabrication  assembly and testing of our products to outside subcontractors 
we believe this concentrated focus enables us to provide our customers with critical time to market and product differentiation advantages 
we sell our semiconductor products to display module manufacturers  which incorporate our products into their display module subassemblies  and to manufacturers of portable handsets and other consumer electronic devices 
we currently generate all of our revenue from customers in asia 
our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders that may be cancelled or the shipment dates may be delayed by the customer 
we operate in one operating segment  comprising the design  development and marketing of analog and mixed signal semiconductors for portable consumer electronics 
the portable consumer electronics market is characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition among a concentrated group of manufacturers  and continually changing consumer preferences 
these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products  product life cycles that typically range from two to three years  continually evolving specifications and significant price competition 
to be successful  we must be able to introduce new products that satisfy the evolving technology and product specifications in an efficient and timely manner 
selling prices for our products and those of our competitors steadily decline during their life cycles 
therefore  if products do not enter commercial production on schedule their profitability declines significantly 
in addition  in the past  portable electronics manufacturers have inaccurately forecast consumer demand  which has led to significant changes in orders to their component suppliers 
we have experienced both increases and decreases in orders due to changes in demand and delays in production by our customers  often with limited advance notice  and we expect such order changes to occur in the future 
total revenue was million in  a decrease of from million in nearly all of our revenue in was generated from sales of our display driver products 
unit shipments were million in  a decrease of as compared to gross margin declined to in as compared to in  as the fixed cost of maintaining a product operations team was spread over lower sales revenue volume  and margins declined on our older products 
operating expenses increased to million in as compared to million in  however  excluding the costs of acquired in process technology and amortization of intangibles  operating expenses increased  due largely to increased headcount to support our new businesses 
our net loss was million in as compared to net loss of million in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million from december  to december   due principally to our net loss  our use of million to acquire mondowave  inc  in february  and million to acquire acutechnology semiconductor  inc in december our net loss widened from to as we invested in new products despite a decline in display driver sales resulting from a lack of sufficient design wins in with our acquisition of mondowave  inc  we expanded into consumer audio applications 
our acquisition of acutechnology semiconductor  inc provides us with innovative power management solutions and adds to our experienced analog design staff 
we added headcount in to fill out the teams in our audio business  and expand our product offerings into led drivers and touch sensor technology products 
we believe this diversification into new product areas provides us a better opportunity for long term profitable growth  but we cannot assure you that our development efforts in these areas will be successful 
within our display driver business  we have focused our r d efforts into newer display driver technologies such as thin film transistor  or tft  and amoled  in which we believe we can incorporate value added features 
we are also investing in new process technology efforts to enable us to design our newer products to a smaller die size  thereby reducing the manufacturing cost per unit 
the timely introduction of new products with smaller die sizes and richer feature sets is essential to improving gross margins on our display driver products 
we currently expect sales to be higher than sales  but that we will still incur an operating loss in we expect that our new product areas will begin to generate design wins in with revenue increasing in the second half of  but we cannot assure you that these new design wins will occur  nor that they will generate revenue in a timely manner 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to valuation of marketable securities  intangible assets and goodwill  uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  stock based compensation  warranty obligations and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates  which are discussed further below 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions eg  stock based compensation  depreciation methodology  etc we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory valuation  valuation of marketable securities  warranty obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  and valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  most of our sales were to large established companies based on purchase orders from these customers with minimal collectibility issues 
customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the credit worthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria will not be met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we perform credit evaluations of each of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon any specific customer collection issues we have identified and our best estimate of allowance requirements 
while we have not experienced any significant credit losses to date  we may experience substantially higher credit loss rates in the future 
our accounts receivable are generally concentrated in a limited number of customers  and we expect them to remain concentrated in the future 
we may increase our credit risk as we expand our limited customer base due to the credit worthiness of newer customers compared with our existing customers 
any significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any current or future customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost which approximates a first in  first out basis or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories by comparing quantity on hand with forecasted future sales based upon assumptions about future demand and market 
table of contents conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory reserve may be required 
when analyzing inventory reserves  we take into consideration the quantity of inventory on hand as well as purchase commitments 
we specifically reserve for lower of cost or market if pricing trends or forecasts indicate that the carrying value of our inventory exceeds its estimated selling price less the cost to dispose of inventory 
the reserve is reviewed each period to ensure that it reflects changes in our actual experience 
once inventory is written down  a new accounting basis is established and  accordingly  it is not written back up in future periods 
our inventory reserve requirements may change in future periods based on actual experience  the life cycles of our products or market conditions 
valuation of marketable securities 
we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities below the cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our marketable securities portfolio  which totals million  includes auction rate securities ars of million at cost as of december  ars are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to thirty five days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par  in a modified dutch auction process 
if sell orders exceed buy orders in the auction  the auction is said to fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible and a fair market value not established until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the underlying securities have matured 
as of december   there had been no failed auctions in our ars  and therefore the fair value of these securities approximated their million carrying value 
subsequent to december   we sold million of ars  but we have experienced first failed auctions in million of ars holdings in our portfolio in february these ars are securitized packages of student loans whose repayment is guaranteed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
they are issued by nonprofit state higher education organizations of montana  kentucky  and mississippi and are rated aaa by moody s investor services 
although we believe that any decline in the fair market value of these securities is temporary  there is a risk that a decline in value may ultimately be deemed to be other than temporary 
in the future  should we determine that the decline in value of these auction rate securities is other than temporary  it would result in a loss being recognized in our statement of operations  which could be material 
as our ability to liquidate the remaining million of ars in the next twelve months is uncertain  we have classified those securities with failed auctions as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
if conditions in the credit markets deteriorate further causing auctions to fail again on these securities  the funds associated with these securities may also not be accessible for in excess of twelve months 
warranty obligations 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality assessment  our warranty obligation may be affected by future product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we regularly monitor product returns and maintain a reserve for warranty expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimation process is based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
from time to time  we may be subject to additional costs related to warranty claims from our customers 
if this occurs in a future period  we would make judgments and estimates to establish the related warranty liability  based on historical experience  communication with our customers  and various assumptions based on the circumstances 
this additional warranty would be recorded in the determination of net income in the period in which the additional cost was identified 
accounting for income taxes 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for income tax uncertainties 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
fin also provides 
table of contents guidance on the recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting and disclosure for income tax uncertainties in interim periods 
fin became effective for us on january  we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax strategies and to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  and revise our estimates  if necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our effective tax rate  income tax provision and net income 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty in the application of complex tax laws 
we record tax reserves for additional taxes that we estimate we may be required to pay as a result of potential examinations by tax authorities 
if such payments ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the reversal of these tax reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine such reserves are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
we have established valuation allowances against deferred tax assets where we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits may not be realized 
during  we established a valuation allowance of approximately million for the company s california state deferred tax assets  increasing our income tax expense 
during  we established valuation allowances of approximately million for us federal deferred tax assets and million for california state deferred tax assets in the us the valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in connection with the purchase accounting resulting from the acquisition of mondowave  inc during the first quarter of  we recorded deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
in connection with the purchase accounting resulting from the acquisition of acutechnology semiconductor  inc during the fourth quarter of  we recorded deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
these deferred tax liabilities are the result of differences in the book and tax basis of the intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition 
because our deferred tax liabilities exceed our deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets recorded in was reversed in  with a corresponding reduction in goodwill as a part of our purchase accounting 
the deferred tax liability will be reduced in future periods as the identified intangible assets are amortized 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock units  and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r was million in and m in we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas no 
r 
the black scholes model requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life 
our computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
in january  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 

table of contents sab no 
 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
the expected life is calculated using the simplified method allowed under sab no 
the weighted average assumptions using the black scholes model are summarized as follows year ended december  year ended december  stock stock options espp options espp expected term years volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average estimated fair value stock based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures that are based on historical experience 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model or forfeiture rate change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our financial results 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted under sfas no 
r  and accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options that are expected to vest  and employee stock purchase plan activity  over the requisite service periods beginning on january   the first day of our fiscal year prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb no 
 compensation cost was recognized based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant between the fair value of our stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity investment 
we used the black scholes model to estimate the fair value 
this model requires the use of judgemental assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the fair value 
we reviewed these assumptions periodically and modified them as conditions changed 
we calculated our stock price volatility and compared with that of peer companies to determine the reasonableness of this variable 
we accounted for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
we amortized deferred stock based compensation on the graded vesting method over the vesting periods of the stock options  which is generally four years 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in accelerated vesting as compared to the straight line method 
as required under sfas no 
r  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle benefit of million for the year ended december   reflecting estimated future forfeitures of options previously expensed under apb no 
asset goodwill impairment 
we are required to assess the potential impairment of acquisition related intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  and significant decline in our market capitalization 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangible assets  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we test for impairment 
table of contents by assigning these assets to reporting units and comparing the expected future cash flows generated by the assets of the reporting unit  as applicable  with the carrying amount of the assets to determine if assets and or goodwill are potentially impaired 
we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a projected discounted cash flow model 
in applying this methodology  we rely on a number of factors  including actual operating results  our internal projections of future unit volume and timing of revenue  margins and operating costs  and estimated risk premiums within discount rates 
many of these assumptions require us to make subjective estimates 
during the fourth quarter of  because of the decline in our market capitalization relative to the net book value  we undertook an impairment review of our intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill 
in our estimation  the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned and the expected future cash flows generated by intangible and long lived assets exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit and intangible and long lived assets  indicating that no impairment was necessary in if actual results are not consistent with our projections used in estimating these cash flows and fair value  we may be required to record impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations

sales to rikei corporation  a japanese distributor  grew in with increases in several new programs at japanese customers 
we will likely experience shifts in our customer concentration in resulting from the ramping down of certain older programs and the ramp up of new programs at different customers  and the diversification of our product offerings 
in  we added new distributors  and we expect that our audio and led driver customers will be manufacturers of consumer electronics rather than display module manufacturers 
while we seek to add additional customers  we expect to remain reliant on a small number of customers for the foreseeable future 
in addition  existing customers may reduce their demand  as has occurred in the past  which could cause period to period fluctuations between customers representing significant amounts of our revenue

gross margin decreased to in from in our average selling price declined in  and our manufacturing cost declines were unable to keep pace with these price declines 
further  our new products were introduced later than originally planned  and therefore were competing with established product offerings from competitors that had already begun to experience price declines 
finally  we recorded a charge of million to write down inventory and record purchase commitment reserves in due to inventory quantities on hand and ordered in excess of forecasted demand  which contributed to the higher cost of sales in as compared to we believe that our new led driver and portable consumer audio products  and our new display drivers incorporating innovative power management and display enhancing features will generate higher unit gross margins in than the products sold in we cannot assure you that we will be successful in launching these new products  or manufacturing these new products on new process technologies at sufficient yields to improve margins  nor that we will gain customer acceptance of such new devices

the fair value assigned to in process research and development was determined using the income approach and applying a discount rate derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect risks related to the products  development completion stage and success 
the estimates used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions of estimated costs to complete development and cash flows from the sale of such products 
such assumptions were believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
we are not currently aware of any material variations between projected results and actual results  nor any new risks or uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time of our original estimates 
if we do not complete development on these projects  or  if we do not achieve market acceptance in a timely manner  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

in addition  stock based compensation expense on incentive stock options issued to us employees is generally nondeductible 
we also incurred non deductible in process r d charges of million in these nondeductible expenses result in a higher tax rate for the company  and increased our effective tax rate approximately in  in and in our tax rate for is not indicative of the rate we would expect on a consolidated basis if we generated consolidated net income 
in  we established a valuation allowance of approximately million for the company s california state deferred tax assets  increasing our income tax expense 
our tax provision for included a valuation allowance recorded against our net us federal deferred tax assets of million and california state deferred tax assets of million 
the valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
associated with the purchase accounting of mondowave  inc and acutechnology semiconductor  inc in  we recorded deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
these deferred tax liabilities result from the difference in book versus tax basis of the intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisitions 
because our deferred tax liabilities exceed our deferred tax assets  the us deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded in was reversed in  with a corresponding reduction in goodwill as a part of our purchase accounting 
the deferred tax liabilities will be reduced in future periods as the intangible assets are amortized 
as a result of our adoption of fin  we recorded a decrease of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and related accrued interest  with a corresponding increase to retained earnings  as of january  we also reclassified million of our liability for recognized tax benefits and related accrued interest from current to noncurrent liabilities  as we do not expect these liabilities to be settled within months 
our unrecognized tax benefits were approximately million at december  and relate to us  state and various foreign jurisdictions 
this amount included million of interest and penalties 
if recognized  all million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate 
we continue to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
during the year ended december   the company recorded approximately thousand of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the company believes it is reasonably possible that a decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits of million could occur within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations 
it is possible that some months or years may elapse before an uncertain position for which we have established a reserve is resolved 
a reconciliation of total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended december  is as follows in thousands balance at january  additions based on tax positions taken during the current year reductions due to lapsing of applicable statute of limitations balance at december  
table of contents we file us  california  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
the through tax years remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities  and the through tax years remain subject to examination by california state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by tax authorities 
we have no ongoing tax examinations by tax authorities at this time 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and through cash generated from operations 
working capital decreased from million at december  and million at december  to million at december   due primarily to our net losses in and  and our expenditures of million to acquire mondowave  inc and acutechnology semiconductor  inc in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million 
net cash used in operating activities was million and  for and  respectively 
we incurred a net loss of million in  compared to net loss of million in for  cash used in operating activities was favorably impacted by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and million in non cash charges for in process r d  intangible asset amortization  and share based compensation 
these favorable impacts were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
accounts receivable decreased million in but increased million in the decrease in and the increase in correspond to the decreases and increases in revenue in the corresponding periods 
additionally  payment terms vary by customer and our receivable balance fluctuates with changes in our customer mix 
our days of sales outstanding were at december  and at december  we expect days of sales outstanding typically to range from to days 
inventory decreased by million in and million in the decrease in reflects the continued decline in sales from to due to the significant decrease in net inventory in as compared to  our annualized inventory turns increased to in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the fourth quarter of to effectively manage inventory volumes  we must carefully monitor forecasted sales by device due to the relatively long manufacturing process for semiconductors and risk of obsolescence in a rapidly evolving industry 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our inventory balances to minimize obsolescence and meet rapidly changing customer demand  and any failure to effectively manage inventory could harm our revenues and profitability 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million in and increased million in the increase in was the result of timing of vendor payments 
the decrease in reflects lower inventory purchasing in as compared to  as we experienced substantially lower sales volume in our days of payables were for the fourth quarter of and for the corresponding quarter of net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  sales or maturities of available for sale securities  net of purchases of available for sale securities  were million and million in and respectively 
the net sales in reflect our use of cash for operations  acquisitions and stock repurchases 
in and we lengthened the maturities of our investment portfolio as interest rate increases subsided 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances may fluctuate significantly in future quarters as we manage our investment mix 
all investments comply with our corporate investment policy  with our primary objective being the preservation of principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we closely monitor the investment yield curve and may in the future invest more of our cash in securities classified as short term investments rather than cash equivalents 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bonds  government securities and auction rate securities  and are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses net of taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
as of december   the portfolio included million at cost invested in student loan auction rate securities of which million at cost experienced first failed auctions in february none of these securities have been in a loss position for 
table of contents more than months 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities mature 
as a result  we have classified those securities with failed auctions as long term investments in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
we used cash of million in to acquire mondowave  inc  the assets of nuelight corporation  and acutechnology semiconductor  inc  net of cash received 
we also used million in and million in for the purchase of property and equipment  primarily for equipment and software for our design engineers and secondarily for furniture and leasehold improvements in our worldwide facilities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  principally for stock repurchases under a plan approved by our board of directors in january to purchase up to million shares 
during  we purchased million shares 
the authorization for stock repurchases expired december  we cannot assure you that additional shares will be authorized for repurchase  but our cash flow will be negatively impacted if and to the extent additional shares are purchased 
cash provided by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases were million in and million in in order to secure key future design wins  we may be required to increase our inventory balances so we can meet rapid increases in product demand from our customers 
for example  in we initiated sales to a customer through a hub  whereby inventory is shipped to a third party warehouse near the customer s manufacturing site and pulled by the customer when required for manufacturing 
we invoice the customer when the customer pulls the inventory from the hub 
this arrangement  and any similar future arrangements  could significantly increase our inventory balances and create short term decreases in cash flow due to the longer period between inventory purchase and customer payment 
under the terms of the mondowave  inc acquisition agreement  we are obligated to pay retention bonuses of million in and million in  and may be obligated to make earn out payments to certain former mondowave  inc employees who joined the company as a result of the acquisition 
these earn out payments shall be up to a maximum of of revenue generated from certain audio products introduced by the former mondowave  inc employees upon their continued employment over the next three years 
under the terms of the acutechnology semiconductor  inc acquisition agreement  we may be obligated to make earn out payments to the former acutechnology semiconductor  inc employees  these payments shall be up to a maximum of of revenue generated from products introduced by the former acutechnology semiconductor  inc employees upon their continued employment with us 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  including potential cash requirements for wafer  assembly or test prepayments or possible inventory increases discussed above 
significant financial requirements  such as the acquisition of another company or research and development efforts in a new technology or business  may result in increased expenses and the need for additional cash to fund these new requirements as well as our ongoing business activities 
we may evaluate potential future strategic acquisitions of all or part of another company 
if needed  we would seek to obtain equity or debt financing to fund these activities 
we cannot assure you that equity or debt financing will be available when needed or  if available  that the financing will be on terms satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we currently have no plans that would require us to seek additional cash

we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order materials and services from these subcontractors well in advance of required delivery dates  and we are obligated to pay for them in accordance with the payment terms 
we expect to receive and pay for substantially all inventory purchased under these purchase obligations within the next three months 

table of contents the following sets forth our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than to to more than total year years years years operating lease obligations software license installment payments purchase obligations other obligations total as of december   we had million of non current unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with fin no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio currently consists of money market funds  municipal and corporate bonds  commercial paper  auction rate securities and us government agency bonds 
our primary objective with this investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities  which approximated million as of december   and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately  are subject to interest rate risks 
however  based on the liquidity of our investments  we believe that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur  it would not have a material effect on our financial condition 
investment liquidity risk 
our marketable securities portfolio  which totals million  includes auction rate securities ars of million at cost as of december  ars are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to thirty five days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par  in a modified dutch auction process 
if sell orders exceed buy orders in the auction  the auction is said to fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible and a fair market value not established until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the underlying securities have matured 
as of december   there had been no failed auctions in our ars  and therefore the fair value of these securities approximated their million carrying value 
subsequent to december   we sold million of ars  but we have experienced first failed auctions in million of ars holdings in our portfolio in february these ars are securitized packages of student loans whose repayment is guaranteed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
they are issued by nonprofit state higher education organizations of montana  kentucky  and mississippi and are rated aaa by moody s investor services 
although we believe that any decline in the fair market value of these securities is temporary  there is a risk that a decline in value may ultimately be deemed to be other than temporary 
in the future  should we determine that the decline in value of these auction rate securities is other than temporary  it would result in a loss being recognized in our statement of operations  which could be material 
as our ability to liquidate the remaining million of ars in the next twelve months is uncertain  we have classified those securities with failed auctions as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
if conditions in the credit markets deteriorate further causing auctions to fail again on these securities  the funds associated with these securities may also not be accessible for in excess of twelve months
