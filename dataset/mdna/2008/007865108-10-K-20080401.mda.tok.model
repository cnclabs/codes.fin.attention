due to the seasonality of our business  we have historically realized a significant portion of our cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
most recently  our cash requirements have been met primarily through cash and cash equivalents on hand during the first half of the year  and through cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
we expect to continue to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months primarily through cash flows from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility 
in addition  on november   we amended and restated our revolving credit facility the new credit facility with bank of america  na bank of america  which expanded our availability from a maximum of million to million see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of the availability under the new credit facility was used to fund the asr to repurchase million of our common shares see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at february   we had working capital of million and cash and cash equivalents of million

working capital decreased to million at february  from million at february  primarily due to the increase in stock repurchases in fiscal see below for further discussion 
total inventories increased by on a square foot basis as of february  compared to last year 
this increase was due to a change in the timing of our floor sets  primarily resulting from an earlier easter holiday in investing activities we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for the construction of new a ropostale stores  to remodel seven existing stores  to complete the rollout of upgraded point of sale systems to our store chain  to open a second distribution center and for certain other information technology investments 
our future capital requirements will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and other strategic investments 
we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal these plans include investments of approximately million to open approximately new a ropostale stores in our new store format including approximately in canada and our first three new stores in puerto rico 
capital expenditure plans also include approximately million to remodel approximately existing stores to our new store format and approximately million for other initiatives 
we had no short term investments at february  we had million in short term investments as of february   consisting of auction rate debt and preferred stock securities 
these securities were all sold during fiscal financing activities we repurchase our common stock from time to time under a stock repurchase program 
the repurchase program may be modified or terminated by the board of directors at any time  and there is no expiration date for the program 
the extent and timing of repurchases will depend upon general business and market conditions  stock prices  opening and closing of the stock trading window  and liquidity and capital resource requirements going forward 
during fiscal  including the asr program  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million  as compared to million shares for million during fiscal and million shares for million during fiscal on november   our board of directors approved a million increase in repurchase availability under the program  bringing total repurchase authorization  since inception of the program  to million 
we used a portion of the additional authorization to immediately execute an asr program to repurchase million of common shares as described below 
on november   we entered into a confirmation agreement with bank of america 
pursuant to the asr  bank of america purchased shares of our common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter of fiscal the final number of shares repurchased by bank of america under the asr amounted to  which was based upon the volume weighted average share price of our common shares over the term of the asr 
the asr was subject to collar provisions that established the minimum and maximum price for the shares  which in turn determined the final number of shares repurchased under the asr 
the initial price of the shares purchased by us from bank of america was subject to a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of the shares during this period 
the asr transaction was completed on january  with the latest increase in repurchase authorization  and after taking into account the million asr  total company share repurchases since inception of the program are million 
accordingly  we have approximately million of repurchase authorization remaining under our share repurchase program as of february  
table of contents on november   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  as lender which expanded availability from a maximum of million to million the new credit facility 
the new credit facility provides for a million revolving credit line 
the new credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of our capital stock and for our capital expenditures 
a portion of the availability under the new credit facility was used to fund our asr to repurchase million of our common shares 
the new credit facility is scheduled to expire on november  at november   we had million outstanding under the new credit facility that was repaid in full on november  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion  including covenants and events of default 
inflation we do not believe that our sales revenue or operating results have been materially impacted by inflation during the past three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our sales revenue or operating results will not be impacted by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of february  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations operating leases employment agreements liabilities for uncertain tax positions event sponsorship and advertising agreement total contractual obligations the operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal  or variable costs such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal our open purchase orders are cancelable without penalty and are therefore not included in the above table 
in addition to the above table  we project making a benefit payment of approximately million from our supplementary executive retirement plan in  which reflects expected future service  and assumes retirement at age see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
there were no financial guarantees outstanding as of february  we had no commercial commitments outstanding as of february  effective at the beginning of the first quarter of  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin as described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were million at february  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments for million of these liabilities 
therefore these liabilities were not included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not created  and are not a party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any 
table of contents arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
as of february   we have not issued any letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventory or any capital expenditures 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information 
therefore  actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in applying such policies  management must use significant estimates that are based on its informed judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
changes in such estimates  based on more accurate future information  may affect amounts reported in future periods 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a weighted average basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a difference in our estimate of inventory at the lower of cost or market as of february  would have impacted net income by million for the fiscal year ended february  defined benefit pension plans we maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan  or serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  is not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the serp liability of million is appropriately stated as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if we had changed the expected discount rate by in  pension expense would have changed by less than  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 
during fiscal long lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  
table of contents significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or under performing business trends 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge 
accordingly  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to our jimmy z stores during fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted fin this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
for those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments see the section recent accounting developments included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at november   we had million outstanding under the new credit facility that was repaid in full on november  prior to november  we had no outstanding borrowings under the prior credit facility since november in addition  we had no stand by or commercial letters of credit issued under the new credit facility 
to the extent that we may borrow pursuant to the new credit facility in the future  we may be exposed to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of entering the canadian market in july we are subject to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in the canadian dollar  which could impact our financial condition 
foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the us dollar 
we also face transactional currency exposures relating to merchandise that our canadian subsidiary purchases using us dollars 
we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation 
a movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value translation fluctuation of approximately million in our net investment  which would be recorded in other comprehensive income as an unrealized gain or loss
