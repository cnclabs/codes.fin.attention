item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview our net revenue was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
we generated net income of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
we incurred losses in all periods prior to  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net revenue consists primarily of sales of our power management semiconductor products 
when evaluating our net revenue  we categorize our sales into four major market segments servers and storage  desktop and workstation  networking and communications  and consumer and portable 
the electronics manufacturing industry is complex and disaggregated  and electronic system designers typically rely upon distributors and outsourced suppliers to provide procurement  manufacturing  design  and other supply chain related services within the industry 
we attempt to quantify the amount of sales within the major markets identified above  but such quantified amounts are approximations only  as we must rely upon estimates and assumptions regarding the incorporation of our products sold to distributors or other outsourced suppliers into the systems of the oems  odms  cems  or merchant power supply manufacturers for each particular market 
in  we estimate that of our net revenue was derived from sales in the server and storage market  from the networking and communications market  from the desktop and workstation market  and from the consumer and portable market 
we believe that a significant portion of our revenues in the upcoming fiscal year shall continue to be derived from sales in the server and storage market 
our sales and accounts receivable are currently concentrated with a small group of customers  and we expect our sales and accounts receivable to similarly be concentrated with a small group of customers in the future 
in  ibm  metatech  sabre and eil each accounted for over of our net revenue  and collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
in  ibm  metatech and sabre each accounted for more than of our net revenue  and collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
while we report revenue for direct sales to particular customers  our sales data may not accurately reflect the additional indirect demand from distributors and outsourced suppliers who purchase our products pursuant to their business relationships with such significant customers 
because we have less visibility into and are not able to quantify this indirect demand  we are unable to determine how much additional revenue these significant customers may affect 
in addition  our sales data also may not identify customers who do not directly account for of our net revenue  but may be significant in that such customers also generate substantial indirect demand from distributors and outsourced suppliers 
if any such significant customer were to stop incorporating our products or third party products containing our components into its designs  we would not only lose the direct revenue we receive from the significant customer  but we could also lose a portion of the indirect revenue from third parties who do business with such significant customer 
if we were 
table of contents to lose or experience a significant reduction in demand from one or more of our key customers either to which we sell directly or which generates demand at an intermediary or if we were to fail to collect our accounts receivable from one or more of our key customers  our operating results and financial position would be materially adversely impacted 
because demand for our products is impacted by demand for our customers products  our revenue depends on the timing  size  and speed of commercial introductions of systems that use our products  and our customers ability to manage their inventory in relationship to such demand 
we continue to expect a significant amount of our revenue to come from the commercial introduction of new systems  which is often more difficult to forecast than ongoing demand for previously introduced systems 
a number of our customers applications  particularly in the desktop and workstation market and consumer and portable market  are subject to short product cycles and prone to delays in development and commercial introduction or significant changes in demand  making it inherently difficult to accurately forecast demand for such applications in any period 
a number of our customers  such as odms  cems  and merchant power supply manufacturers  also are dependent upon the demand of other companies  which makes sales to such parties more difficult to forecast accurately 
these fluctuations in demand could materially affect our operating results on a period by period basis 
we recognize revenue on our sales upon shipment with a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances 
a portion of our revenues come from customer orders that are both received and shipped against within the same quarter  or turns business  which is inherently difficult to forecast 
we estimate turns business as a percent of net revenue as the ratio of net revenue less beginning backlog to net revenue making adjustment for the effect of sales return reserves or other adjustments to net revenue not included in backlog 
turns business was between and in each of the third and fourth quarter of  as well as the fourth quarter of if our turns business increases  forecasting revenue becomes more difficult 
generally  our current sales practice allows customers to  and customers routinely do  revise and cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates on relatively short notice pursuant to changes in the customer s requirements 
in addition  in circumstances where we have achieved our objectives in a period or when we have limited or insufficient inventory available  we may delay shipment of orders 
for these reasons  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
we typically sell directly through our internal sales force to customers in north america 
we sell both directly and indirectly through distributors internationally 
we have made no sales to us distributors 
in  sales to international distributors represented of net revenue  compared to in we expect the sales channels we use and the mix of business between distribution and direct sales to change over time as our product offerings and customers evolve 
our sales to international distributors are made under agreements that do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide limited return rights in the event of product failure 
our sales through distributors are typically at lower gross margins  but also typically have lower associated selling and collections expenses than direct sales 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of purchases of silicon wafers and related costs of assembly  test and shipment of our products  and compensation and related costs of personnel and equipment associated with production management and quality assurance 
our gross margins have historically varied significantly  and may continue to vary  based on a variety of factors  including changes in the relative mix of the products we sell  the markets and geographies where we sell  the size and nature of our customers in these markets  the levels of sales to distributors  manufacturing volumes and yields  discounts or other financial incentives to customers and inventory and overhead costs 
generally  as we introduce new products  we initially incur higher unit production costs  and as the product ramp progresses  our overall unit production costs decrease as manufacturing efficiency improves 
in addition  because our power management products are highly complex and the manufacturing process for our products is technically challenging  previously undetected design defects and minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields or quality 
such decreases in yields or quality can impact our gross margins due to a reduction in our revenue as a result of significant product returns  may cause us to incur product replacement costs  and may cause us to rework or scrap inventory that had been manufactured with the defect 
in the second quarter of  we initiated a recall of approximately million of material due to poor product quality as a result of a manufacturing defect by one of our third party vendors  and we believe that approximately million of charges and excess costs were incurred as a result of the recall and product defects 
these costs materially impacted our financial results for the quarter and for the full fiscal year 
we are also unable to 
table of contents determine what adverse effects these types of recalls or quality problems may have on our reputation or our future business from new or existing customers 
if we are unable to manage these risks  our revenue and gross margins and financial position may be materially adversely impacted 
finally  consistent with the overall market for power management solutions  we expect to face price pressure over time 
in order to maintain or improve our gross margins  we will need to introduce new  lower cost products  increase volumes  reduce unit costs or achieve a combination of these objectives 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
as lead times at our manufacturing vendors can be up to three months or more  we typically build inventory based on our sales forecasts rather than customers orders  subjecting us to inventory risk 
in the event of an inventory write down either because the inventory exceeds demand  becomes obsolete  or contains previously undetected defects and must be reworked or scrapped  our gross margins could be materially adversely impacted 
on the other hand  because our manufacturing lead times tend to be longer than our order lead times and capacity at our manufacturing vendors may be constrained  our net revenue and relationship with our customers could be adversely impacted if we do not have adequate inventory available to meet customer demand 
our inventory levels were million at the end of the fourth quarter  and inventory turns  calculated as our annualized cost of revenue for the quarter divided by our inventory as of the end of such quarter  increased to in the fourth quarter of compared to turns in third quarter of and turns in the fourth quarter of if the amount of inventory we are holding increases or our inventory turns decrease  the risk of a potential inventory write down and adverse impact on our gross margins increases 
our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in the design and development of our products  prototyping and other development expense  and the depreciation costs related to equipment being used for research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses can fluctuate as a result of long design cycles with periods of relatively low expenses punctuated with increased expenditures for prototypes and product development toward the end of the design cycle 
our selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in general management  sales and marketing  finance  human resources and information technology  as well as expenses related to travel and entertainment  professional services  and insurance 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in general management  sales and marketing  finance  human resources and information technology  as well as expenses related to travel and entertainment  professional services  and insurance 
our income tax expense is dependent on our estimated annual effective tax rate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate has fluctuated and is dependent on the mix of income and losses between domestic and international operations  as well as the utilization of available net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income in the us and changing assessments of statutory tax rates 
the effective tax rate on our domestic income is currently significantly lower than statutory rates because we utilize net operating loss carry forwards from which no previous benefit had been recognized to offset taxable income 
our domestic deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance because  dependent on the available objective evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
if we continue to have profitable domestic operations  we may revise this assessment  which could result in a favorable adjustment to reported income tax expense in the period of re assessment followed by higher reported tax rates in subsequent periods 
our foreign income is typically subject to lower statutory rates than our domestic income 
we expect that both our mix of income and losses as well as the statutory rates we are subject to internationally may change over time  resulting in changes to our effective tax rate and reported income tax expense 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criterion is based on a purchase order received from the customer 
determination of criterion is based on shipment when title transfers to the customer 
determinations of criteria and are based on the fixed price charged for products delivered adjusted for any applicable discounts and management s judgment regarding the collectibility of the amounts billed 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment when title passes and a provision is made for estimated returns and allowances 
we have made no sales to us distributors 
us distributors typically receive sales price rebates and have inventory return privileges 
our sales to international distributors are made under agreements that do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide for limited return rights in the event of a product failure 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
we track historical rates of return by identifying the period in which the returned products were originally shipped 
we then compute a historical sales return rate for prior quarterly periods 
to determine the estimated return rate for any period  this historical sales return rate is adjusted for unusual past returns experience related to specific quality issues or other unusual circumstances that are not expected to recur and consideration of any current information about known product failure rates or business developments 
based on this historical data as well as current business expectations  we estimate sales returns 
while we believe our methodology enables us to make reasonable estimates of sales returns  because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited historical experience  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
a significant difference between actual amounts and our estimates could significantly impact our reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis or market 
we record provisions for inventories for excess or obsolete work in process and finished goods 
newly developed products are generally not valued until they have been qualified for manufacturing and success in the marketplace has been demonstrated through sales and backlog  among other factors 
in addition to provisions based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are made for the remaining inventory based on assumptions about future demand 
we identify excess and obsolete inventory by analyzing inventory aging  recent sales  order backlog  and demand forecasts 
based on these and other factors  we estimate on an individual product basis the net realizable value of our inventory 
net realizable value is determined as the forecast sales of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
we reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value if it is less than standard cost 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable estimates 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than our projections  additional inventory provisions may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 

table of contents the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains  and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax strategies and to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we established a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets for all periods since inception 
if we continue to record profitable domestic operations  a reduction to our recorded valuation allowance may occur in future periods  which would likely result in an income tax benefit in the period of reduction and increase to our effective tax rate in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation 
prior to  we applied the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock based compensation as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issues to employees  and related interpretations including financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and interpretation of apb opinion no 
 to account for our stock options 
under this method  compensation expense was recorded only if the deemed fair value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price on the date of grant 
beginning in  we account for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the grant 
for grants made prior to january   the compensation cost is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of each grant using the method prescribed by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or awards plans 
for grants made on or after january   the compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in the absence of an actively traded market for similar financial instruments to those being granted  estimating the fair value of stock based compensation is inherently difficult because the value of the financial instruments cannot be objectively verified even in retrospect 
we use the black scholes formula in estimating the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant 
the black scholes formula and sfas no 
r requires us to estimate key inputs to the formula such as expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rates that determine the stock based compensation expense 
we estimate these key inputs using historical information  peer company data and judgment regarding company specific and market factors and trends 
when estimating expected volatility  we consider the historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility on traded options on our stock 
however  due to the limited history of trading and lack of liquidity in both the market for our stock and options on our stock  we also consider the implied volatility on a group of peer companies to develop our estimates as well as other factors 
option grants typically vest over four years to provide long term compensation and a retention incentive to employees 
to estimate the expected term of options granted  we consider the contractual life and vesting period of the option  historical exercise behavior of our employees  and other factors 
if the estimates for these key inputs are changed over time  the amounts recorded for future stock based compensation arrangements may increase or decrease  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million in we currently have no debt and believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and investments as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and meet our capital needs for the current fiscal year 
our operating activities provided net cash of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the primary sources of cash from operations in consisted of net income providing million after adjusting for non cash items included in net income and decreases in inventory of million related to sales of inventory and disposition of inventory related to product recalls  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of million 
the primary sources of cash from operations in were net income providing million after adjusting for non cash items included in net income and increases in accounts payable of million  partially offset by increases in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million 
higher sales levels in resulted in increases in inventory and accounts receivable as well as higher production resulting in increases in accounts payable balances

in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock 
the primary sources of cash from financing in  and were sales of securities under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
contractual obligations we depend entirely upon third party foundries to manufacture our silicon wafers 
due to lengthy foundry lead times  we must order these materials well in advance of required delivery dates  and we are obligated to pay for the materials in accordance with their payment terms  which typically require payment within three months of shipment 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  and the years in which such obligations are expected to be settled in thousands and thereafter total operating lease obligations purchase obligations inventory purchase commitments are comprised of the estimated obligation for in process silicon wafers 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements  it does not require any new fair value measurements 
we are required to apply the provisions of sfas no 
beginning in the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated statements of financial position  operations  or cash flows 
the fasb agreed to a one year deferral of statement s fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis  intends to clarify disclosure requirements about the fair value measurements of pension plan assets by plan sponsors  and will develop additional guidance on how statement applies to measurements of liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  government treasury and agency securities 
as of december   we held no short term investments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars  accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes 
to date  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations
