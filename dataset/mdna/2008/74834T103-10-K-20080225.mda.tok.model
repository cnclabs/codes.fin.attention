overview our company and business model quest software  inc delivers innovative products that help it organizations get more performance from their computing environment 
our product areas are application management  database management  windows management and virtualization management 
the focus of our products is based upon generating higher levels of performance  manageability and productivity throughout our customers it infrastructure and with products and services that enable them to manage the investments they have made within their it environment 
our initial core competency as a database management company was built upon deep expertise within the oracle database platform where we assembled a portfolio of products to manage and speed the development on the platform 
as customers required heterogeneous database management tools  we broadened our product portfolio to deliver complementary solutions and expanded our offerings to address other database platforms  including db and sql server 
today  most of our database management revenue is derived from products focused on the oracle platform 
in the last several years however  oracle has increased the functionality of their database products creating a stronger competitive offering which has impaired our license growth for certain products 
this has negatively impacted our database management product growth 
on the other hand  our database development product group led by toad continues to be the most significant revenue contributor of our oracle database products 
in early oracle introduced sql developer  a free tool which competes with toad 
while toad distinguishes itself as a feature rich heterogeneous database platform tool  we invested in sales and marketing resources to broaden our customer footprint with toad and strengthen our feature set of this key product 
while doing this we simultaneously sought to stimulate our broader database driven product revenues by placing more emphasis on the sql server database  a microsoft product 
given the rapid growth of sql server within the market  our strategy has been to foster continued development on this platform and to build increased management capabilities into our offerings in support of the platform 
application deployments typically front large databases  thus the database logically interacts with other elements of the application infrastructure 
this logical linkage and reliance on the database led quest into its next product focal point known as application management 
from our acquisition of foglight software in january and then sitraka in october  to our current offerings for application management  we have made significant investments and evolved the development of products for this market 
foglight remains our flagship product and largest revenue component of our application management offerings 
as our customers face the need to manage more complex applications with service 
table of contents oriented architectures  our products for identifying application outages and performance have become important tools 
while was an investment year for our application management products  we released foglight in mid year after establishing a market presence in both the database and application management markets  we sought to broaden our portfolio further into the windows management tools market in early with our acquisition of fastlane technologies 
in  we acquired aelita software 
our acquisition of aelita  combined with internally developed products  solidified our position as one of microsoft s leading isv s 
further  in august of we acquired scriptlogic extending our product footprint to address desktop management  a new market for us 
we market and support management tools for five key microsoft platforms windows server  active directory  exchange  sql server and the microsoft desktop 
our products address both migration and management of the windows platform 
our migration business comprises a set of products which support migration from other competitive platforms to the comparable microsoft platform  as well as migrations from earlier to the most current version of microsoft platforms 
in addition  we offer products which complement the core platform tools which are natively used by customers to manage these platforms once they are in a production environment 
as our windows products emerged and continued to grow in market popularity  the composition of our overall revenue profile changed from being primarily derived from the oracle database platform tools to a more balanced profile with our windows products 
during our windows products represented the predominant portion of our organic growth 
as the market for virtualization began to develop we made an investment in vizioncore during which served as the cornerstone for our next strategic product line expansion 
during we further built out this product portfolio with subsequent acquisitions of invirtus and provision networks 
in december of we acquired the remaining minority interest in vizioncore 
as customers increase the use of today s virtualization platforms the market is moving past the early adopter phase into mainstream production usage in support of server consolidation  disaster recovery and other usage scenarios across the datacenter 
the taxonomy of the virtualization management market is following the development of paths taken previously where platform companies create the delivery mechanism and partner with other third party vendors such as quest to support their platform 
today  the platform market leader is vmware but with microsoft and citrix xensource entering the market  it is expected that cross platform tools will emerge to support the requirements of the datacenter such as provisioning  monitoring  reporting  disaster recovery and the typical functions found in today s physical environment 
we believe that the depth and breadth of our management capability across the entire it stack uniquely positions quest to become a preferred provider of these tools 
strategic acquisitions and investments have been a key part of our corporate strategy 
during we spent approximately million to acquire nine companies and invested million in an early stage private company 
this strategic deployment of capital covered many of our existing market segments including application management  windows management and virtualization management 
our acquisitions of vizioncore and scriptlogic contributed to our revenue growth in we intend to continue to identify and acquire companies in adjacent or contiguous markets  as we have done in the past 
we have also used acquisitions and investments to build upon or extend our core competencies with incremental technology to increase our existing product functionality or complete a key portion of a deliverable on the product roadmap 
we derive revenues from three primary sources software licenses  post contract technical support services referred to as pcs and professional consulting and training services referred to as pso 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees  and our license fees are typically calculated either on a per server basis or a per seat basis 
pcs contracts entitle a customer to telephone or internet support and unspecified maintenance releases  updates and enhancements 
first year pcs contracts are typically sold with the related perpetual software license 
table of contents and renewed on an annual basis thereafter at the customer s option 
annual pcs renewal fees are priced as a percentage of the net initial customer purchase price which includes both the fee for a perpetual license and first year pcs 
revenue is allocated to first year pcs based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months although at times we sell pcs with terms of greater than months 
over the last few years revenues generated by our pcs offerings have become a larger contributor to total revenues 
as our pcs customer base grows  the pcs renewal rate has a larger influence on the pcs revenue growth rate and the amount of new software license revenues has a diminishing effect 
therefore  the growth rate of total revenues does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of new software license revenues in a given period 
the primary determinant of changes in our pcs revenue profile is the rate at which our customers renew their annual maintenance and support agreements 
if our pcs renewal rates were to decline materially  our pcs revenues  total revenues and cash flows would likely decline materially as well 
although we do not currently expect our pcs renewal rates to deteriorate  there can be no assurance they will not 
we also provide pso services which relate to the installation and configuration of our products and do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
revenue allocated to pso services is analyzed based on vsoe of fair value and recognized as the services are performed 
such revenues represent  and of total services revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
our primary expenses are our personnel costs  which include compensation  benefits and payroll related taxes  which are a function of our world wide headcount 
we estimate that these personnel related costs represented approximately of total expenses in our headcount grew by approximately over the course of total share based compensation expense and related payroll taxes decreased from million in to million in  representing a year over year decrease  due primarily to the fact that no option awards were granted from september through december due to the restatement 
our option granting activity resumed in the first quarter of we invest a significant portion of our cash flows into research and development in order to design  develop and enhance a wide variety of products and technologies 
we have also maintained an approach of using acquisitions as a strategy to obtain incremental products and technology that will be attractive to our customers 
in addition  we are primarily a direct sales driven organization that expends significant selling costs in order to secure new customer license sales and the follow on pcs revenue stream that can continue forward beyond the initial license sale 
additionally  with the acquisitions of scriptlogic and vizioncore we now will also sell our products through a distributor and reseller model 
our foreign currency gains or losses are predominantly attributable to translation gains or losses on the re measurement of our net balances of monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries  including accounts receivable and cash  which were primarily denominated in the euro  and to a lesser extent  the british pound and canadian dollar 
the foreign currency translation adjustments to these balance sheet items are calculated by comparing the currency spot rates at the end of a quarter to the spot rates at the end of the previous quarter 
on this basis  we recorded  in other income expense  net  a net gain of million in and our results as discussed in more detail throughout our md a from to  total revenues increased to million and total expenses increased to million  resulting in operating margin of 
income from operations increased from million to million and net income increased from million to million 
our windows and virtualization management products were the primary product contributors to revenue growth from to  offset slightly by reduced revenue from our database management 
table of contents products 
total revenues from our north american operations increased by million  or  while total revenues from the rest of world operations increased by million  or 
sales of perpetual software licenses and services from acquired company products were significant contributors to revenue growth in the contribution from these acquired products to our total revenue growth in was approximately million or 
results of operations from all acquisitions are included in our consolidated income statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
for more information concerning our acquisitions during the periods presented herein  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
devaluation of the us dollar relative to non dollar currencies in which certain international sales are denominated  primarily the euro and the british pound  contributed to total revenues 
total expenses increased by due to dollar devaluation against the canadian dollar  russian ruble  british pound and euro  in which certain international expenses are denominated 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally perpetual software licenses and which portions must be deferred generally pcs and pso 
in addition  we analyze various factors including our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us make judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and the related technical practice aids of the aicpa 
in accordance with sop  we cannot recognize any revenue before all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we deliver the products  fees are fixed or determinable and license agreement terms are free 
table of contents of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that they may not be complete and final  and collection is probable 
we initially capture value for our products by selling a perpetual software license to end customers 
the fee for the first year of pcs is included in  or bundled with  the perpetual software license at the time of initial sale 
as such  the combination at initial sale of a perpetual software license and one year of pcs represents a multiple element arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
when all four of our revenue recognition criteria are met the multiple element aspect of our arrangements means the only revenue recognized upfront  at the time of initial sale  is the residual revenue allocated to the perpetual software license 
the revenue associated with the fair value of the undelivered pcs and or pso included in the initial sale is deferred and is subsequently recorded to revenue ratably over the support term and as such services are performed  respectively 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on vsoe of fair value 
revenue for our standalone sale of annual pcs renewals in years two  three and beyond is recognized ratably over the support term 
sales of pcs for multiple annual periods are treated similarly 
revenue from our pso is generally recognized as professional services are performed in accordance with the underlying service contracts 
our pcs vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to the prices our end customers pay for this support when it is sold separately  that is  when we enter into an arms length  annual renewal transaction with end customers where the only offering sold is pcs 
these standalone pcs renewal transactions are typically one year in duration and are priced as a targeted percentage of the initial  discounted purchase price which includes both the upfront license fee and the first year of pcs 
we bill pcs renewal transactions in advance of the services provided 
we also offer end customers the right to purchase pcs for multiple annual periods at discounted prices beyond the first year as they will be paying cash upfront  well in advance of the multi year services performed 
our pso vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to our established pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
our pso are typically sold as time and materials based contracts that range from five to fifteen days in duration 
we sell pso both standalone and as part of multiple element arrangements 
our vsoe of fair value is impacted by estimates and judgments that  if significantly different  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in current and future periods 
these estimates and judgments include  among other items the ability to identify and validate vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements via the use of sampling techniques  the impact on sampling results of customer negotiating pressure on renewal rates  the impact on sampling results of pcs renewals on deals originally sold via indirect channels  the fair value of that undelivered element for sampled transactions  and where a customer s pcs renewal is in its product life cycle when numerous year s renewal efforts have been combined into one transaction a co term 
historically  we have been able to establish vsoe of fair value for pcs and pso but we may modify our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
this could result in changes to our vsoe of fair value for these undelivered elements 
if this were to occur  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
table of contents would differ significantly from our historical results 
if we were unable to support at all through vsoe the fair value of our pcs or pso  the entire amount of revenue from our initial  upfront sale of both a perpetual software license bundled with one year of pcs and any pso would be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element hardware  software  specific upgrade rights  etc 
in a bundled software and services arrangement  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services are performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we sell a small amount of time based software licenses or term licenses each year wherein customers pay a single fee for the right to use the software and receive pcs for a defined period of time 
approximately of license revenue was generated by these time based software licenses 
all license and support revenues on these term licenses are deferred and recognized ratably over the license term 
we license our products primarily through our direct sales force  our telesales force and  increasingly  indirect channels including value added resellers and distributors 
for our direct sales  we utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions upon which our products and services are sold to our end customers 
for our indirect sales  we accept orders from our resellers and distributors when we are informed that they have existing orders from an end customer 
we utilize written contracts coupled with purchase orders as the means to establish the terms and conditions of these indirect sales transactions 
indirect sales through resellers  which are a growing proportion of our transaction volume  are generally handled via processes and policies that are similar to an end customer sale 
our practice until january  was to defer revenue recognition on indirect sales transactions of significant size until receipt of payment assuming all other revenue recognition criteria had been satisfied as collectability was not reasonably assured 
because of a change in circumstances involving improved cash collection histories with certain resellers we modified our revenue recognition practices to recognize revenue upon delivery of the software when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
the modified practice  which now allows for the earlier recognition on most of our reseller transactions  has been implemented effective january  substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
since such acceptance provisions are not contained in our software license arrangements as standard provisions and the incidence of returns in accordance with such acceptance provisions cannot be reasonably estimated  if a contract does include such a provision we recognize revenue upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that cancellation is not likely  we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other requirements have been met 
our standard payment terms are days but may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
we generally deem payments that are due within months to be fixed and determinable based on collections history and thereby satisfy the required revenue recognition criteria 
for additional information regarding our revenue recognition accounting policies see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for sales returns and cancellations as well as an allowance for bad debt 
regarding our allowance for sales returns and cancellations  our standard form license and pcs and or service agreements do not typically or expressly provide for product returns or cancellations as a matter of right unless we have breached the product warranty and are unable to cure the breach 
our product warranties are typical industry warranties that a product will perform in accordance with established written specifications 
however  we maintain the sales returns and cancellations allowance to cover the circumstances where the company accepts returns or cancellations on a discretionary basis even though not contractually obligated to do so 
this allowance also covers estimated losses for our customer s unwillingness to make required payments 
the allowance for bad debt is for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments related to enforceable contracts 
to support both these allowances  we are required to make significant estimates of future software license returns  of cancellations for both pcs and of pso  and of write offs of customer accounts as bad debts all related to current period revenues 
the amount of our reserves is based on these estimates  the contractual terms and conditions of our contracts  our accounts receivable aging and our historical collection experience with a customer base 
if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in our accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
while such return  cancellation and bad debt write off amounts have historically been within our planned expectations and the allowances established we cannot guarantee that our sales returns and allowances will be adequate to cover future performance issues of our customer base and allowances may be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of and determined that the carrying value of each reporting unit was less than the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach and income approach were the methodologies deemed the most reliable and were the primary methods used for our impairment analysis 
we will continue to perform annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews could result in significant charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
amortizing intangible assets these assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and include technology  customer lists  maintenance contracts  trademarks and non compete agreements acquired and are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
we make estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in 
table of contents the combined company s product portfolio  acquired company key personnel s willingness and ability to compete  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
the net carrying amount of amortizing intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  these intangible assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the other intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
investments in non consolidated companies all of our investments in non consolidated companies are currently accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies operations 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist when we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors  voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements  are also typically considered in determining the appropriate accounting treatment 
we periodically monitor our investments for impairment and will record reductions in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies and  as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
as part of this evaluation process  our review includes but is not limited to a review of each company s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings and revenue outlook  operational performance  management or ownership changes  and impacts from competitive pressures 
if we determine that the carrying value of our investment in a company is at an amount below fair value  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a significant amount of judgment  estimation and uncertainty and our estimate of income taxes can be highly sensitive to shifts between such tax jurisdictions 
additionally  our us and foreign tax returns are subject to routine compliance reviews by the various tax authorities 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that could result from the examination of our tax returns 
determining the income tax expense for such contingencies requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation 
effective january   we adopted accounting standards board fasb financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
both steps presume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this may require us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a periodic basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  current year tax positions  expiration of statutes of limitations  litigation  legislative activity  or other changes in facts and circumstances 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional 
table of contents charge to the tax provision in that period 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such uncertain tax positions could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of our net income taxes payable receivable balance 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
us income taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings from certain non us subsidiaries because those earnings are considered permanently reinvested 
accounting for share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas r  share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and the risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility based upon the implied volatility derived from the market prices of our traded options with similar terms 
we determine the expected term of our share based awards based on historical exercise patterns across two different groups of employees 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the forfeiture rate on share based awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining share based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future share based compensation costs 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to re measure the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their local currency into united states dollars 
this process results in foreign currency re measurement gains and losses included in other income expense  net in the consolidated income statements 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these re measurement gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on the judgment of management and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including transfer pricing arrangements  billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is one consideration of determining the functional currency  however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations are also considered 
other income expense  net includes any gain or loss associated with the re measurement of a subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of a subsidiary is the united states dollar 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  any gain or loss associated with the translation of these 
table of contents financial statements into the united states dollar would be included within accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the local currency  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
as a result of this determination  assets and liabilities in these subsidiaries are re measured at current exchange rates  except for property and equipment and deferred revenue  which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are re measured at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year except for revenue and costs related to the above mentioned balance sheet items which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
accordingly  we had a net foreign currency re measurement gain of million for the years ended december  and and a net loss of million for the year ended december   recorded to other income expense  net in the respective periods 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the local currency  these translation gains and losses would have been included in our statement of shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income for each of the years presented  and would not have the impacts on our net income that are currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon fluctuations within the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
the company operates in a number of currencies worldwide  most notably in the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar and russian ruble 
any future re measurement gains or losses could differ significantly from those we have experienced in recent years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets

table of contents licenses revenues licenses revenues from sales of our windows management products was the most significant driver of our licenses revenues growth in the rest of world 
licenses revenues from sales of our virtualization management products and windows management products acquired from scriptlogic in august were the main drivers of our licenses revenues growth in north america 
north american licenses revenues growth in these product areas was offset by reduced licenses revenues within our application and database management product areas 
effective january   we modified our revenue recognition practice for reseller transactions  due to a change in circumstances involving improved cash collection histories with these resellers 
the modified practice has been applied to transactions consummated on or after january  licenses revenues for the twelve months ended december  includes an approximate million benefit as a result of this change 
in and prior years  licenses revenues from those transactions was typically deferred until cash was collected from the reseller 
services revenues the largest component of services revenues is pcs revenue 
services revenues also include fees for pso 
our windows management product line and our oracle database development products primarily drove growth in services revenues 
pcs revenues from renewals of annual maintenance agreements have continued to grow 
revenues from pso remained flat year over year at approximately million as the number of large scale migration projects was less than the previous year and the mid year introduction of foglight while generally requiring pso  did not compensate for the decrease in migration projects 
pso as a percentage of total service revenues represented and in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages increase decrease dollars percentage cost of revenues licenses services amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenues cost of licenses cost of licenses primarily consists of third party software royalties  product packaging  documentation  duplication  delivery and personnel costs 
cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
cost of services cost of services primarily consists of personnel  outside consultants  facilities and systems costs used in providing pcs and pso 
cost of services does not include development costs related to bug fixes and upgrades which are classified in research and development and which are not separately determinable 
personnel related costs increased by approximately million  primarily due to growth in technical support headcount which increased by year over year as well as the million impact from the devaluation of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the british pound

summarized annual cash flow information is as follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our primary source of operating cash flows was the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
our primary use of cash from operating activities was for compensation and personnel related expenditures 
we intend to continue to fund our operating expenses through cash flows from operations 
the analyses of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities are as follows accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to an increase in daily sales  which resulted in an increase in operating assets  reflecting a use of cash of million for the twelve months ended december  the remaining change in accounts receivable of million  relating to the impact of non cash foreign currency translation adjustments  is included as part of the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
day s sales outstanding dso was days and days as of december  and  respectively  and our daily sales increased to million for the quarter ended december  compared to million for the quarter ended december  collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our revenues and their linearity and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
deferred revenue increased in each period resulting in an increase in operating liabilities  reflecting a cash inflow of million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and respectively 
increases in deferred revenue were due primarily to growth in our software pcs customer base and to our acquisition of scriptlogic  which contributed million to the overall increase 
the primary cash outflow within operating assets and liabilities during the twelve months ended december  was million paid for taxes  an increase of over the period 
investing activities our primary source of investing cash flows was proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
our primary uses of cash from investing activities were for purchases of marketable securities  cash payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
cash used in investing activities in the period included million net cash paid for acquisitions  million designated for the acquisition of passgo in january and million for a cost method investment in one early stage private company 
we spent million in capital expenditures and sales  maturities and purchases of marketable securities resulted in a net cash inflow of million 

table of contents we will continue to purchase property and equipment needed in the normal course of our business 
we also plan to use cash generated from operations and or proceeds from investments in marketable securities to fund other strategic investment and acquisition opportunities that we continue to evaluate 
we plan to use excess cash generated from operations to invest in short and long term marketable securities consistent with past investment practices 
financing activities our primary source of financing cash flows has historically been from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock option plans  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation and proceeds from a repurchase agreement 
we have also financed acquisitions and capital expenditures with net borrowings under a repurchase agreement in prior periods 
excess tax benefits related to share based compensation were historically reported under net cash provided by operating activities but  under sfas r these amounts are classified as a cash flow from financing activity 
excess tax benefits in years prior to adoption of sfas r were presented in the operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows and was million in during the year ended december  cash flows from financing activities were affected by proceeds from and repayment of a repurchase agreement 
we did not receive proceeds from exercises of stock options during or the last two quarters of because we took action to block option exercises in connection with our then pending restatement and stock option investigation 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next to months 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described under the caption risk factors 
one of these risks is that our future business does not stay at a level that is similar to  or better than  our recent past 
should a general economic downturn or similar event occur  or should the company s products become uncompetitive or less attractive to end customers  we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities 
we would then be required to use existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances to support our working capital and other cash requirements 
also  acquisitions are an important part of our business model 
as such  significant amounts of cash could and will likely be used in the future for additional acquisitions or strategic investments 
if additional funds are required to support our working capital requirements  acquisitions or other purposes  we may seek to raise funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
we can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual obligations or commercial commitments include our facility lease commitments and operating leases for office facilities and certain items of equipment 
in addition  we are committed to pay additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million as capital calls are made 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that could reduce our liquidity 

table of contents the following table summarizes our obligations as of december  and the effect we expect such obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations acquisition related obligations total contractual cash obligations includes million in cash restricted at december  for our acquisition of passgo  which closed on january  in addition to the cash commitments above  million of unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of penalties and interest  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
we also entered into earn out agreements with the shareholders of companies we acquired during the years ended december  and the earn out payments are based on the acquired company s products total revenue growth over a specified period after the acquisition date 
one immaterial earn out payment was made in and the amount or likelihood of future payments based on future results is not determinable and therefore are not included in the above table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we are a us dollar functional company and transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
in most instances  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to both transaction and translation risk relating to changes in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is composed of the combination of our foreign net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net balances of monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses depending on the directional movement of the foreign currencies versus the us dollar and our operational profile in foreign subsidiaries 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period may be lessened by the economic benefits of diversification and low correlation between different currencies  but there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue to be true in future periods 
during and  we had a million foreign currency gain 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the euro  the canadian dollar  the british pound and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposures  nor do we use such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we regularly monitor the potential cost and benefits of hedging foreign exchange exposures with derivatives and there remains the possibility that our foreign exchange hedging practices could change accordingly in time 
interest rate risk our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we place our investments with 
table of contents high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the united states government and its agencies 
our investments in marketable securities consist of united states government and government agency bonds  auction rate municipal securities and commercial paper 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of shareholders equity 
we presently do not intend to liquidate our short and long term investments prior to their scheduled maturity dates or  with respect to our auction rate securities  the reset dates 
however  in the event that we did liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there were no changes in market interest rates  we could be required to recognize a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate 
at december   we had an unrealized loss of million on our investments in debt securities compared to million at december  our remaining investment positions and duration of the portfolio would not be materially affected by a basis point shift in interest rates 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states the amortized book value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands amortized book value weighted average rate investments maturing by december  thereafter total portfolio includes million in cash equivalents and million in auction rate securities
