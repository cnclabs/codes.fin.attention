item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for each of the three years in the period then ended should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including our expectations of future industry conditions  strategic plans and forecasts of operational results 
various risks may cause our actual results to differ materially 
a list and description of some of the risks and uncertainties is contained below and in the summary of risk factors included in item a 
overview headquartered in reykjavik  iceland  decode is a biopharmaceutical company applying its discoveries in human genetics to dna based diagnostics  consumer genetic analysis services  and drugs for common diseases 
our population approach and resources enable us to isolate genes and drug targets directly involved in the development of many of the diseases which pose the biggest challenges to public health 
we are turning these discoveries into a growing pipeline of diagnostic tests and therapeutics taking aim at the causes of disease  not just the signs and symptoms 
as these diseases are common and current therapies are of limited effectiveness  we believe that our strategy represents a significant opportunity to create better medicine with major potential both near and longer term in the global marketplace 
we believe that decode s advantage derives from our population approach to human genetics and the ability to apply this approach directly to diagnostic and drug development 
in iceland  we have comprehensive population resources and one of the largest genotyping facilities in the world  enabling our scientists to isolate key genes and gene variants contributing to common diseases 
the proteins encoded by these genes and other proteins with which they interact in the disease pathway offer drug targets that we believe are directly involved in the onset and progression of disease 
our work indicates that these genes confer risk by increasing or decreasing the activity of common biological pathways  placing individuals on a spectrum of risk that encompasses the population as a whole 
small molecule drugs that can modulate the activity of the pathway in question may therefore have broad potential utility  not only to those at highest risk but perhaps also to those at average risk  which in the common diseases may be unacceptably high 
moreover  these pathways often provide biomarkers that can be used to assess the efficacy of a compound from preclinical to mid stage clinical testing 
similarly  we can develop diagnostic products for diseases by isolating key genes and gene variants linked to those diseases 
in order to optimize our resources and develop products to generate revenue in the near term  we are applying our discoveries and unique expertise in human genetics and genotyping to our molecular diagnostics 
since the beginning of  we have launched four dna based reference laboratory diagnostic tests to detect genetic variations that we have linked to increased risk of several common diseases 
such tests can be employed as an aid in developing more effective disease prevention strategies by helping individuals to better understand their inherited risk of a given condition  as well as to identify patients likely to respond well to a given drug 
in april  we began offering decode t  our first reference laboratory dna based test  which detects a gene variant we discovered to be associated with increased risk of type diabetes 
in july  we introduced our second reference laboratory dna based test decode af  for a gene variant we discovered to be associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke 
in october  we began offering decode mi  a laboratory reference test which detects a gene variant which is associated with early onset heart attack  myocardial infarction  or mi 
most recently  we launched decode proca  which detects eight genetic variants we have linked to increased risk of prostate cancer 
all of these tests are offered by decode via direct sales efforts to physicians and a dedicated website www 
decodediagnostics 
com 
in november  we also launched the first consumer genetic analysis service decodeme 
the service takes advantage of decode s leadership in human genetics and its whole genome genotyping capabilities 
through decodeme  subscribers can put themselves in the context of the latest discoveries in genetics  learning what their own dna says about their ancestry  body traits such as hair and eye color as well as whether they have genetic variants that have been associated with higher or lower than average risk of a range of common diseases 
this information is continually updated as new discoveries are made  and is presented in subscribers secure individual web pages 
through our chemistry and structural biology units  based in the united states  we are able to discover novel small molecule therapeutic compounds  take candidate compounds through pre clinical testing  and manufacture sufficient quantities for early stage clinical trials 
our product development group  which has expertise in drug and disease modeling  designs and implements our clinical trials 
we also actively explore out licensing  co development  and partnering opportunities  and in certain programs have brought directly into clinical trials compounds that address targets we have identified through our genetics research but which were originally developed by other companies for other indications 
over the past year we have also made significant progress in our drug development programs 
in we completed phase i and phase iia clinical studies for dg  our leukotriene a hydrolase inhibitor being developed for the prevention of heart attack 
the phase iia study examined safety  tolerability and dg s impact on the production of leukotriene b ltb  the pro inflammatory molecule produced by the branch of the leukotriene pathway that decode s gene discovery work has linked to increased risk of heart attack 
the results of our phase i and phase iia trials demonstrated that the compound is well tolerated at all dose levels tested  has a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once a day dosing  and delivers dose dependent reductions in ltb production in healthy subjects and heart patients alike 
we have also successfully completed our reformulation of dg  our phase iii flap inhibitor also being developed for the prevention of heart attack 
we are actively seeking a partner with whom to take the next step in clinical development of our leukotriene program 
dg is our novel  first in class antagonist of the ep receptor for prostaglandins e  which we are developing as a next generation oral anti platelet therapy aimed at preventing arterial thrombosis without increasing bleeding time 
in a phase ii clinical trial and additional clinical pharmacology studies completed in  dg was shown to dramatically inhibit platelet aggregation as well as platelet activation mediated specifically through vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein vasp  a biomarker useful for measuring platelet activity 
these effects were concentration dependent and were seen irrespective of whether patients were receiving concomitant therapy with aspirin 
importantly  we did not see an increase in bleeding time 
we are conducting a second clinical pharmacology study examining the impact of dg on top of aspirin and plavix 
we expect to release top line data from this study in the second quarter of we are concurrently working on a once daily formulation for dg  and continue to engage in partnering discussions 
in addition  decode is conducting drug discovery work on its pde program  the most advanced of its preclinical programs 
it has been well established that pde inhibitors a well accepted target for a broad range of common diseases  including asthma  copd  cognitive disorders and vascular disease have been difficult to clinically develop since a common side effect is emesis and nausea 
our platform has led to the development of several lead series of compounds which demonstrated efficacy in a range of animal experiments while avoiding the common side effect 
we plan to file an ind this year on a compound from this program 
decode and illumina  inc are working together to develop dna based diagnostic kits utilizing decode s gene discoveries in heart attack  type diabetes and breast cancer and illumina s platform for snp genotyping 
decode is also actively exploring drug development partnerships in its most advanced therapeutic programs  in order to spread risk and cost  and to focus resources on the advancement of its drug discovery work and preclinical candidates 
the goal of our business strategy is to maximize the creation of value from our human genetics  drug discovery  drug development and diagnostics work and to capture that value for the company and its stockholders 
our product development pipeline now includes drug development programs in heart attack and arterial thrombosis  and following the launch of four reference lab tests  we are advancing the development of dna based risk predisposition tests in exfoliation glaucoma  deep vein thrombosis  and breast cancer  among other conditions 
executing on our strategy advancing and capturing the value of these products while continuing our discovery work in a broad range of common diseases requires us to spread risk and manage cost 
we are constantly evaluating the optimal balance between proprietary and partnered product development  the level of our investment in research and development  the deployment of cash resources for product development  and the financing environment 
as we invest in proprietary programs  we leverage our capabilities to provide services to fee paying customers 
we also receive contract and grant funding from various governmental agencies 
we have formed drug and other product development alliances 
our chemistry subsidiary provides drug discovery and contract manufacturing services to fee for service customers  and our other service offerings include protein crystallography products and instruments through our biosystems subsidiary  as well as protein structure analysis contract services through our structural biology subsidiary  and dna analysis services through our genotyping laboratory in reykjavik 
we derive revenues primarily from research funding and other fees from our service customers  as well as from research grants 
milestone payments and upfront  exclusivity  technology access and technology development fees under our collaboration agreements constitute another source of our revenues 
our expenses consist primarily of research and development expenses such as salaries and related employee costs  materials and supplies  and contractor services 
we believe that our ongoing work in genetics  the advancement and marketing of our diagnostic programs  and the conduct of clinical trials in our therapeutics programs will require significant ongoing expenditure 
in we continued to advance our drug development programs  successfully completing with dg a successful phase i multiple dose ranging study  a day extension of the multiple dose study  various drug drug interaction studies and a food effect study  and a phase iia trial 
we completed a successful phase iia trial of dg along with a highly informative clinical pharmacology study conducted in the presence and absence of aspirin and we are currently planning a study that will assess the pharmacology of dg in the presence of clopidogrel and clopidogrel plus aspirin 
we also completed two important drug drug interaction studies that significantly de risked the further development of dg we have established a clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia certified reference laboratory for offering dna based tests  and expect to follow our recent launches with several other tests we now have in development 
we anticipate incurring additional net losses at least through the next several years  due to  in addition to the above mentioned factors  depreciation and amortization  as well as stock based compensation and other non cash charges 
we expect that our revenues and losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial  especially because progress in our scientific work and milestone payments that are related to progress can fluctuate between quarters 
we do not believe that comparisons of our quarter to quarter performance are a good indication of future performance 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  including restricted cash equivalents million and non current investments million and as we advance discovery work and broaden our drug development pipeline we will require significant additional capital for product development and so we will continue to investigate additional avenues of financing 
our ability to obtain capital in the future will be affected by conditions in the global financial markets and in the pharmaceutical industry 
we expect that more favorable conditions in those markets will present opportunities for us  while downturns in the market valuations of biotechnology companies and of the equity markets more generally will restrict our ability to raise additional capital on attractive terms 
one of the main issues confronting big pharmaceutical companies is their lack of promising new drugs to treat major indications 
as many leading brand name drugs come off patent and face generic competition  developing successful new medicines will become critical for filling the gap 
we believe that companies such as ours may be well positioned to play an important role in filling the gap in the pipeline of new drugs 
our product portfolio and development pipeline dna based diagnostics and consumer genetic analysis we currently offer four dna based tests for gauging individual risk of several common diseases all launched since the beginning of and have several more such tests in development 
we also offer a consumer genetic analysis service  decodeme 
we are actively marketing these products and are seeking payor reimbursement for our diagnostic tests 
these products and others we now have in development are listed in the table below 
the predicted launch dates for those tests still in development are given only as a guide according to our current expectations for each program 
therapeutic area name of product launch date type diabetes decode t april atrial fibrillation stroke decode af july early onset heart attack abdominal aortic aneurysm intracranial aneurysm decode mi october consumer genetic analysis decodeme november prostate cancer decode proca february exfoliation glaucoma decode glaucoma q drug development programs the following is a summary of the development of our drug candidates 
because of uncertainties involved in the drug development process as well as costs related to late stage clinical development  the actual timing for the events described below may differ materially from that provided in this summary 
we have two compounds in development for the prevention of heart attack 
these programs come out of our discovery of major risk variants in two genes encoding proteins in the leukotriene pathway 
these variants in the genes that code for leukotriene a hydrolase ltah and lipoxygenase activating protein flap appear to confer risk in the same way by causing an up regulation in the production of leukotriene b  a potent pro inflammatory molecule that is the end product of one branch of the pathway 
the therapeutic goal of both compounds is to inhibit the activity of the pathway  lowering the production of ltb and thereby decreasing the inflammatory activity in atherosclerotic plaques and reducing the risk of heart attack 
in addition to reducing the risk of heart attack  these drugs may provide benefit in other inflammatory diseases 
dg  discovered internally by decode s chemistry unit  is a small molecule inhibitor of ltah  which is directly involved in the synthesis of ltb in  we completed our phase i program  the results of which demonstrated that dg was safe and well tolerated at all doses tested  has a pharmacokinetic profile suited for potential once a day dosing  and significantly reduces ltb levels in a concentration dependent manner 
we also concluded a phase iia study in late  which demonstrated safety and toleratbility and a significant reduction in ltb  even at lower doses than were originally considered 
decode has also in licensed a flap inhibitor from bayer ag  now known as dg our phase ii clinical studies demonstrated that dg was well tolerated and reduced production of ltb in a dose dependent manner 
this effect was seen on top of the effects of the current standard of care  which included statin therapy for a majority of patients in our trials 
in we began a phase iii clinical trial for dg  a trial which we voluntarily suspended because the drug tablets appeared to dissolve more slowly than anticipated  potentially providing lessening amounts of active drug the longer they were stored 
we have successfully reformulated the compound 
we are currently seeking a partner with whom to take the next step in development of our leukotriene program 
dg is being developed as an anti platelet compound for the prevention of arterial thrombosis 
dg is a first in class small molecule inhibitor of the ep receptor for prostaglandin e  a g protein coupled receptor gpcr 
it has been demonstrated by in vitro studies that pge may have additive stimulatory effects on platelet aggregation beyond those of other potent agonists such as adp or thromboxane a  targeted by clopidogrel and aspirin  respectively 
the results of the phase i program showed dg to be well tolerated across the entire dose range studied 
the compound can effectively inhibit platelet aggregation in a dose dependent manner without increasing bleeding time 
we completed a successful phase iia trial of dg along with a highly informative clinical pharmacology study conducted in the presence and absence of aspirin 
we also completed key drug drug interaction studies with dg that demonstrated a lack of any relevant interaction by dg on two common routes of drug metabolism 
based on the results of our clinical studies thus far  dg appears to be well tolerated  showing little difference in bleeding events between dosing arms and placebo  and to potentially offer focused means of preventing the formation of thrombi by specifically inhibiting platelet aggregation mediated by ep we are currently working on a once daily formulation 
we are conducting a study that will assess the pharmacology of dg in the presence of clopidogrel and clopidogrel plus aspirin 
we expect to release top line results from this study in the second quarter of among our most advanced preclinical programs  we are pursuing a pde inhibitor program across several indications  a program begun pursuant to our agreement with roche 
we use many of our employee and infrastructure resources across several programs  and many of our research and development costs are indirectly attributable to an individually named program or are directed broadly to applicable research programs 
however  taking into account costs that are specifically attributable to individual programs and allocations of our research and development program costs based upon those direct costs  we have cumulatively invested million  million and million in our heart attack myocardial infarction  or mi  arterial thrombosis and stroke programs  respectively  from the beginning of to date december  
inception to date costs are not available as these costs were not historically tracked by program 
we have not applied for or received marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities in any country for any of our drug candidates 
in order for us to achieve marketing approval in the united states  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidate 
other countries have similar requirements 
historically  the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials through phase ii have often not been predictive of success in later clinical trials 
many new compounds have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary marketing approvals 
additional risks and uncertainties involved in the development and commercialization of any products are described under item a in our reports on forms k and q 
we expect that it will be several years  if ever  before we receive revenues from the commercial sale of our therapeutic products 
furthermore  our strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products 
entering into collaboration with a partner at any point in the development or commercialization of a product is a business decision 
when making this decision we do and will consider  among other matters  the complexity of the indication  the size  complexity and expense of necessary development and or commercialization efforts  competition in the market and size of the applicable market  an assessment of our own resources financial and operational  and an assessment of the resources of a potential partner 
in the event that we do collaborate on any of the above programs in the future  a partner will have a level of control  which may be significant  over the pre clinical development or clinical trial process for a product 
as a result the completion date of such a partnered program could largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary drug candidate will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
acquisitions  joint development programs and in licensing as part of our business strategy  we continue to consider joint development programs and merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products in late stage development  intellectual property or financial resources 
illumina 
in may  we entered into a strategic alliance with illumina  inc illumina to develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic products 
under the terms of the agreement  decode and illumina will share development costs equally and split operating profits from the sales of diagnostic products 
our initial focus will be developing diagnostics for heart attack  breast cancer and type diabetes 
also as part of the agreement  we have installed illumina s snp genotyping platform to carry out high density  whole genome studies utilizing our comprehensive population genetics resources in iceland  thereby  enabling us to expand our contract genotyping business to offer illumina s platform and assay technologies together with our proprietary analytical services for customers 
in certain programs we have taken advantage of the fact that drug targets we have identified through our genetics research have already been employed by other companies to make developmental compounds for other indications 
by licensing these compounds or entering into co development arrangements we have been able to leapfrog over several steps of drug discovery  entering directly into phase ii clinical trials 
dg  our most advanced compound for the prevention of heart attack  was licensed from bayer healthcare ag  which was initially developing it for asthma 
in  we concluded a phase ii trial in asthma  working with cephalon on their compound cep  originally developed for parkinson s disease 
we may consider opportunities like these in the future 
results of operations from the years ended december   and our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon  among other things  the pace and progress of our proprietary research and clinical development efforts  the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  and the progress of our own research and development efforts 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  development by us or our competitors of new technological innovations  ability to market products or services  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key suppliers  protection of proprietary technology  ability to obtain additional financing  ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements  and compliance with governmental and other regulations 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct pre clinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive significant revenues or royalties based on therapeutic or diagnostic products for a period of years  if at all 
financial highlights as of and for the year ended december  include at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash equivalents compared to million at december  included in this amount at december  is million of non current investments and million of restricted cash equivalents 
the net utilization of our cash and investments in reflects principally the costs associated with the advancement of our drug development programs as reflected in the million of cash we used in operating activities  together with the net proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions  principally with regard to our property in woodridge  illinois million and certain equipment million 
research and development expense was million in as compared to million in and million in  reflecting the advancement of our drug and diagnostic programs  the launch of our first dna based tests for gauging individual risk of common diseases and our decodeme service offerings  and the acceleration of our gene and target discovery work 
our revenue was million in as compared to million in and million in the revenue in aggregate is substantially unchanged in as compared to but then does reflect growth in our genetic and us service lines offset by decreased grant revenue and the conclusion of our diagnostics alliance with roche 
as of december   our deferred revenue had grown to million from million as of december   largely on account of the growth of genetic services 
in june  we completed a sale and leaseback of our property in woodridge  illinois 
pursuant to the agreement  we sold the woodridge property for million in cash and leased the property back under a year lease at an initial rent of  per month  subject to annual rent increases of 
concurrent with the sale and leaseback we paid the existing mortgage loan million which had been collateralized by the woodridge property 
due to the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  certain auction rate securities ars held by us at december  and classified as investments  non current  on the balance sheet  have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
because of these circumstances we recognized an other than temporary loss on these investments of million during the fourth quarter of and a temporary  unrealized loss  of million 
our apparent losses increased million million other than temporary and million temporary during the first two months of volatility in the credit and capital markets persisted in and  if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience downgrades on our investments  we may incur additional impairments to our investment portfolio 
into  we will focus on using our core capabilities in human genetics  and existing infrastructure to build upon the commercial opportunities presented by our diagnostics work and decodeme with near term value creation in mind 
at the same time  we have taken steps to ensure that we have cash at hand for two years 
we have slimmed down certain parts of our operations  and will continue to evaluate and analyze other non core elements of our operations  as well as seek continued efficiencies throughout the organization 
revenue as compared to as compared to year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except revenue     in  our business strategy is focused on emphasizing our core capabilities in human genetics and leveraging those strengths to build on opportunities to generate near term revenue from products that we already have available 
a core focus of effort will be diagnostics and our consumer genetics service  decodeme 
at the same time  we plan to advance our early and late stage drug programs through corporate partnerships and revenues to be generated through diagnostics and our contract services 
we will also leverage our capabilities to continue to pursue and receive research grants 
in the majority of our programs we are pursuing diagnostic and early stage drug development on our own 
depending on the nature of each prospective business opportunity  the key components of the commercial terms of such arrangements typically include one or more of the following research funding  up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees  fees for particular services  milestone payments  license or commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing from the commercialization of products 
collaborations with our most significant partners include f 
hoffmann la roche roche therapeutics in november  we signed a three year agreement with roche to co develop inhibitors of pde for the prevention and treatment of vascular disease  including stroke 
this agreement  which has now expired  continued work advanced under the agreement  and focused on optimizing lead compounds identified under the previous agreement and beginning clinical development 
under this agreement we received million of research funding 
we may receive milestone payments and royalties if roche advances any compounds found under this agreement 
diagnostics 
in june  we signed a five year alliance with roche s diagnostics division and through june we collaborated to develop and market dna based diagnostics for major diseases 
during the term of the alliance  which has now expired  we received million in research funding  up front fees and milestone payments under the agreement and we may receive additional milestone payments upon the achievement of research and development milestones by roche and royalties on the sales of diagnostic products developed by roche 
revenues from these alliances with roche amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred with these collaborative programs with roche amounted to  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
merck co  inc merck obesity 
in september  we entered into a three year alliance with merck aimed at developing new treatments for obesity 
under the alliance  we combined research efforts with merck in the genetics of obesity to identify  validate and prioritize a series of drug targets to take into development 
during the three year research program  which has now expired  we have received research funding  technology access fees and milestone payments in the aggregate amount of million 
subject to merck s developing products based on collaboration discoveries  we may also receive development milestones and royalties 
we discovered three genes linked to obesity under this alliance  and merck has generated a lead series of compounds against one of the targets we validated through our genetics research 
revenues from this alliance with merck amounted million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there were no costs incurred in connection with this alliance during the years ended december  and as these payments were technology access fees 
costs incurred during the year ended december  was million 
information rich clinical trials 
in february  we entered into an agreement with merck which provides that decode will conduct information rich clinical trials on a range of merck s developmental compounds that merck selects for inclusion in the program 
the term of the alliance is seven years  subject to termination by merck after five years 
the collaboration involved three agreements a a license and research collaboration agreement  b a stock and warrant purchase agreement  and c a warrant agreement 
under the terms of the license and research collaboration agreement  we will receive royalties on sales of drugs and diagnostics developed as part of the alliance  will receive milestone payments as compounds or pharmacogenomic tests reach the market  will receive research funding for the clinical development of compounds and pharmacogenomic analysis  and received a one time technology access fee of million 
a contingency clause on the technology access fee provides that if decode rejects the first two non exclusive development compounds that merck presents to the collaboration  then merck has the right to request a refund of  of the technology access fee 
the remaining amount of the technology access fee is non refundable 
to date  merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement 
revenues and costs from this alliance with merck amounted to million and million  respectively for the year ended december  there were no revenues or costs during or as this collaboration has been on hold during these periods 
government research contracts and grant funding we have received various research grants from divisions of the united states national institutes of health nih  the commission of the european communities ec and other government agencies and private foundations 
research grants for multiple years are based on approved budgets with budgeted amounts subject to approval on an annual basis 
nih grants generally provide for reimbursement of allowable expenditures while grants under the ec generally provides for fifty percent reimbursement of allowable research and development related expenditures 
our significant research contracts include national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases niaid 
in september  decode was awarded a five year million contract by the niaid  a division of nih 
under the contract  decode will apply its population approach and resources to discover genetic factors associated with susceptibility to certain infectious diseases and with responsiveness to vaccines targeting such diseases 
decode may receive million in additional research funding over the remaining term of the agreement 
we recognized revenue of million  million and million from research grants for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred with research grants amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
significant elements of our revenue are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands genetic services    other service fees and research funding   milestone payments  up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees    government research contracts and grant funding   other    our revenue for the periods presented generally reflects our strategic focus on proprietary drug discovery and development  including that performed under contracts and grants with the nih and ec  and also a shift away from corporate funded research broadly 
our revenue  in aggregate  is substantially unchanged in as compared to but then does reflect growth in our genetic and us service lines offset by decreased grant revenue and the conclusion of our diagnostics alliance with roche 
we expect to leverage our commercial opportunities presented by our genetic services  particularly diagnostics but also those inherent in decodeme and genotyping services 
at december  we had million in deferred revenue  compared to million at december  of this deferred revenue  million relates to our agreement with merck to conduct information rich clinical trials in iceland and  to date  merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement 
we expect that our revenues will fluctuate from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial especially because progress in our scientific work  including milestone payments that are related to progress  can fluctuate between periods 
cost of revenue as compared to as compared to year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except cost of revenue     our cost of revenue consists of the costs of services provided to customers and collaborators and the costs of programs under research contracts and grants  including i the entirety of the costs incurred in connection with programs that have been partnered and on which we receive research funding  ii costs associated with other service fee revenues  and iii the total amount of those costs incurred in connection with discovery and development work performed under research contracts and grants 
at times  we invest in addition to costs covered by research funding received in such collaborative programs and in addition to monies received under research contracts and grants 
the increasing costs of revenue for as compared to and then also to reflect the conclusion of our diagnostics alliance with roche and the completion of the merck obesity research program  offset by growth in our genetic and us service lines but the particularly the growing amount of discovery and development work performed under ongoing contracts and grants with the nich and ec  including those obtained in connection with the acquisition of uvs in january growth in the cost of discovery and development work performed under contracts and grants with the nih and ec in and again in is largely due to our high density  whole genome studies utilizing the illumina snp genotyping platform and our comprehensive population genetics resources in iceland 
further  in we conducted a phase ii trial in asthma for a compound developed by cephalon and through continued our efforts in the pde inhibitor program for vascular disease stroke pursuant to our agreement with roche 
more specifically  our cost of revenue for compared to increased primarily due to the changing sources of revenue as described above 
the overall increase in compared to is attributable to greater expense for chemicals and consumables million  employee compensation million  salary and stock and contractor services million  offset by a decrease of depreciation and amortization million 
our cost of revenue for as compared to increased principally due to the greater usage of chemicals and consumables million primarily related to beginning our high density  whole genome studies  offset somewhat by a decrease in contractor services million and depreciation and amortization million 
also  our cost of revenue for includes stock based compensation expense under sfas r million 
research and development as compared to as compared to year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except research and development     our research and development expenses consist of the following year ended december  salaries and other personnel costs    materials and supplies    contractor services and other third party costs   overhead expenses    depreciation and amortization    stock based compensation   our research and development expense for reflects the advancement of our drug and diagnostic programs  the launch of our first dna based diagnostic tests for gauging individual risk of common disease and our decodeme service offerings  and the acceleration of our gene and target discovery work 
as we continued our high density  whole genome studies utilizing the illumina snp genotyping platform we have seen increases in related materials and supplies as well as the attendant salary and related costs in and the relatively higher amount of contractor services and other third party costs in as compared to and then also is largely on account of the clinical development of dg which we initiated a phase iii trial in early and then voluntarily suspended in late with near term value creation in mind  our core focus in will be towards building our diagnostics business and genotyping services 
at the same time  we aim to advance our therapeutics programs through partnerships 
with this focus  we believe that our overall investment in research and development for the fiscal year may be in the range of to million 
selling  general and administrative expense as compared to as compared to year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except selling  general and administrative    the increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is primarily attributable to increased compensation million  salary and stock and increased contractor services related to the selling and marketing of our genetic service offerings million 
into  a central focus of investment will be in building our diagnostics and consumer genetics service  and therefore  in the sales and marketing efforts 
increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to were offset by decreased legal expenses million on account of litigation regarding certain proprietary and confidential information in that was concluded in increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is the result of increased legal fees million principally incurred in relation to our lawsuit to protect intellectual property 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses include a million gain on the sale of property 
further  beginning in  selling  general and administrative expense also includes stock based compensation expense under sfas r million 
interest income as compared to as compared to year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except interest income    our interest income is a function of both the balance of our cash and investments which generally have been declining as resources are deployed in operations and the rate of return we are able to garner under our investment policy which average rate of return had  in general  been increasing 
we expect to use our cash and investments principally for advancing our discovery and development programs 
in the meantime  we will invest the monies received in accordance with our policy  having the objective of preserving principal and maintaining a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtaining competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
at present we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in money market funds and government debt securities  and to liquidate our holdings of our auction rate securities if and when auctions on them begin to clear 
interest expense as compared to as compared to year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except interest expense     our interest expense has increased in as compared to and our interest expense is primarily attributable to interest on our senior convertible notes due in that we issued in april million of principal at a full par price and then again in november a further million of principal at a price of of par 
with the additional million of notes added in  our cash interest payments are approximately million on an annual basis for the senior convertible notes 
taking into account also the accretion of the discount of the notes and the amortization of offering costs  our total interest expense related to the senior convertible notes is expected to be approximately million for the year ending december  in june  as a result of our sale and leaseback of woodridge being treated as a financing  a portion of our rent payments are charged to interest expense million in  and which will serve to increase our annual interest expense by approximately million per annum 
other non operating income  net as compared to as compared to year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except other non operating income and expense  net  the increase during is due to a gain from a legal settlement net amount of million offset by an other than temporary impairment on our investments of million 
in june we entered into a legal settlement to end ongoing litigation regarding certain proprietary and confidential information 
financial terms of the legal settlement stipulated that we would be paid million  which was paid prior to december  we recognized the million during  net of litigation expenses incurred of million 
during  primarily as a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  we recognized an other than temporary loss on investments in auction rate securities ars  classified as investments  non current  on the balance sheet 
the estimated market value of our investment  non current  ars holdings at december  was million  which reflects an million adjustment to the principal value of million 
although the ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on the valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we have recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended december   reflecting the portion of ars holdings that we have concluded have an other than temporary decline in value 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in if uncertainties in these credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience additional downgrades on our investments  we may incur additional impairments to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flows and reported earnings 
our other non operating income and expense  includes the net impact of foreign exchange in in other non operating income and expense  net consists of the net impact of foreign exchange  unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and  in  loss on early extinguishment of debt and a realized loss on the sale of investments 
as a consequence of the nature of our business and operations  our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
the net impact of foreign exchange on the translated amount of our non us dollar denominated liabilities  net together with transaction gains and losses  amounted to a gain loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our losses on derivative financial instruments in million resulted from three forward foreign currency exchange options we entered into as economic hedges against foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our isk denominated operating expenses but that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result of having prepaid the short and long term debts that were secured by mortgages on sturlugata we recorded a loss on early extinguishment debt during amounting to million and consisting of i prepayment fees million  ii write off of remaining unamortized finance costs million  and iii remaining unamortized discount on the long term debt million 
in december  we sold investments and realized a loss on the sale of million 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from research and development collaborative agreements  and the issuance of equity securities and long term financing instruments  million from the beginning of to december  
at december   future funding under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments  royalties and other payments that we may earn under such collaborations 
of the million  approximately million is expected to be received during the year ending december   with the remaining amount due through we make significant investments in proprietary research and development and we incur the costs of such activities 
in the near term  this requires us to devote resources to our in house drug and diagnostic development which we believe will better position us to capture the most value to us in our discoveries 
as we identify promising discoveries for further development  we may choose to continue the development ourselves into and through clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  distribution and marketing 
in other cases we are or will be working to varying degrees with partners 
the decisions we make as to these matters will affect our cash requirements 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the level and timing of our research and development expenditures  our ability to access the capital markets  to obtain new research and development collaboration agreements  to obtain and maintain contract service agreements in our pharmaceuticals  biostructures  clinical research trials and genotyping service groups  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  and capital expenditures at our facilities 
changes in our research and development plans  notably the entry into clinical trials of drugs based on our discoveries  development of our genetic services and marketing thereof or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  including non current investments of million and restricted cash equivalents of million 
at december   we held investments in auction rate securities ars with original purchase principal values totaling million  of which million is classified as non current investments on our balance sheet 
as of december   we had million invested in ars  which were classified as current investments on our balance sheet 
except for the remaining million of these securities we have reduced our holdings of ars during through the auction process and further reduced it by million subsequent to year end by selling  at par value  the ars security classified in current investments at december  the non current investments in ars held by us are private placement securities with long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction process at pre determined calendar intervals  generally each month 
this mechanism generally allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
we generally invest in these securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
however  the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of our remaining ars in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders and this has resulted in multiple failed auctions 
our non current investments in ars represent interests in debt obligations  namely life insurance wrapped issues  of companies offering credit derivatives  and of entities on which monoline insurers retain capital put rights 
the remaining ars investments are generally collateralized by pools of commercial paper  investment grade corporate debt  asset and mortgage backed securities  government and money market issues and other ars 
consistent with our investment policy guidelines  all of the ars investments were rated as investment grade at least a or better at the time of purchase and subsequent to year end remain rated as investment grade 
based on a third party valuation  the estimated market value of our non current investments in ars at december  was million  which reflects an million adjustment to the principal value of million 
although the ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on the valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we have recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended december   reflecting the portion of ars holdings that we have concluded have an other than temporary decline in value and this charge is included in other non operating income and expense  net in our statements of operations 
we have recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income an unrealized loss of million for those ars for which we believe the loss is temporary 
the securities for which we believe the loss is temporary total million of principal  are collateralized by pools of asset and mortgage backed securities and investment grade corporate debt  and are guaranteed by investment grade  monoline insurers 
due to the present lack of observable market quotes on the non current investments in ars  we engaged a third party to value these securities at december  the valuation models used to value the securities include those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation of our investments in ars is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact the valuation include changes in credit ratings of the securities or their guarantors  underlying collateral value  discounts rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
historically  given the liquidity created by the auctions  ars were presented as current assets under investments 
given the failed auctions  certain ars held by us are illiquid until there is a successful auction for them 
accordingly  those ars determined to be illiquid at year end have been reclassified from investments to investments  non current on our balance sheet as of december  the credit and capital markets have continued to be volatile into our apparent losses increased million million other than temporary and million temporary during the first two months of if uncertainties in these credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience additional downgrades on our investments  we may incur additional impairments unrealized  even realized to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flows and reported earnings 
while the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets is impacting our financial flexibility  we do not believe the conditions will have a material impact on our cash flows or our ability to fund our operations during the fiscal year into  our focus remains within the same broad strategic continuity  emphasizing our core capabilities in human genetics and leveraging those assets to build upon the commercial opportunities presented by our diagnostics work and decodeme 
with near term value creation in mind  our core focus in will be towards building our diagnostics business and genetics services which includes decodeme and our genotyping services business 
at the same time  we aim to advance our therapeutics programs through partnerships and then through resources we are able to generate from our diagnostics business 
we are taking steps to ensure that we have a sustainable operation and have slimmed down elements of our broad operation to focus our resources in line with our goal of having two years of cash on hand 
we will continue to analyze other non core elements of our operations as well as continue to seek efficiencies throughout the organization 
with this focus  we believe that our overall net use of cash for the fiscal year may be in the range of million to million  excluding any major new alliances or treasury activities 
as we advance our genetic services and our drug development pipeline we will require significant financial resources and so we will continue to investigate avenues of financing  such as collaborations and licensing arrangement  further public or private equity offerings  additional debt financing and other forms of financing 
however  no assurance can be given that collaborations and licensing arrangements or additional financing will be available when needed  or that if available  will be obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may have to curtail operations or attempt to raise funds on unattractive terms 
year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    cash and cash equivalents  at end of period   cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
together with our investments million and restricted cash equivalents million  this balance million is million less than at december  the net utilization of our cash in is principally owing to cash used in product development  research and general operations as reflected in the million cash we used in operations  capital expenditures of million  and then with net proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our property in woodridge  illinois million and certain equipment in iceland milion 
available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy having primary objectives of liquidity and safety of principal while generating income from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our cash is deposited only with financial institutions in iceland  the united kingdom and the united states having a high credit standing a a or better 
we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in accordance with our policy  having the objective of preserving principal and maintaining a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtaining returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
at december   our investments are in auction rate securities and an agency bond 
at present  we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in money market funds and government debt securities  and to liquidate our remaining holdings of auction rate securities if and when auctions on them begin to clear 
at december   our cash is largely invested in us dollar denominated money market and checking accounts and also in icelandic krona denominated accounts 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash used in our operations is principally owing to cash used in therapeutic and diagnostic product development  research and general operations as reflected in the million cash we used in operations  as more fully described above  most importantly attributable to the significant research and development investments being made in advancing our drug and diagnostic development programs 
investing activities 
our investing activities have consisted of short term investments in marketable securities and capital expenditures 
during our restricted cash equivalents increased by million in connection with the leaseback of our woodridge property 
in  we acquired million of cash in our purchase of uvs  money used to fund the acquired liabilities of uvs 
in we completed the sale and leaseback of our reykjavik  iceland facilities at sturlugata and krokhals d and e 
in july  we commenced installation of illumina snp genotyping platform and financed the equipment purchased million with a thee year capital lease with an icelandic financial institution 
with the exception of the illumina equipment purchase  we principally made replacement capital expenditures during  and and invested in certain computer and laboratory equipment 
we aim to make only necessary replacement capital expenditures in the near term 
net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to timing of our capital expenditures and other investments as well as changing business needs 
financing activities 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities in the year ended december   as compared to million that was provided in the year ended december  and million that was used in the year ended december  our most significant financing activity for was the sale and leaseback of our property in woodridge  illinois netting us million after the payment of transaction costs and the repayment of our existing property mortgage 
additionally  in september  we entered into a sale and leaseback of certain laboratory equipment amounting to million 
further  we had ongoing repayment of and installment payments on debt  capital lease and finance obligations amounting to million in in june  we completed the sale and leaseback of our property land and building in woodridge  illinois 
pursuant to the agreement  we sold the woodridge property for million in cash and leased the property back under a year lease at an initial rent of  per month  subject to annual rent increases of 
our obligations under the lease are collateralized by a letter of credit in an initial amount of million that may be reduced upon certain conditions 
the letter of credit is collateralized by restricted cash equivalents million at december  
we are accounting for the sale and leaseback of the woodridge as a financing 
as such  the property will remain on the balance sheet and continue to be depreciated through the lease term 
proceeds on the sale have been recorded on the balance sheet as a finance obligation and a portion of the rental payments under the lease will be applied  using the effective interest method  to reduce the finance obligation with the remainder of the rental payments recorded as interest expense 
transaction costs amounting to million have been deferred and will be recorded as interest expense over the term of the lease  using the effective interest method 
concurrent with the woodridge sale leaseback financing  we paid the existing mortgage loan million which had been collateralized by the woodridge property 
more significant financing activities for the year ended december   include our sale of  principal amount of senior convertible notes due at a price of of par netting million  our sale of  shares of common stock netting million  the sale and leaseback of illumina and other equipment and proceeds from other equipment financings million and debt service million 
financing activities for the year ended december  largely consisted of prepayments of short and long term debts secured by mortgages on sturlugata million  prepayments of long term debts secured by mortgages on krokhals d and e million refinancing of the mortgage on our woodridge  il facility million which freed up million of previously restricted cash reflected above in investing activities  the sale and leaseback of certain equipment million and other debt service million 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period total less than year years years years years more than years in thousands senior convertible notes  including interest   long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest   finance obligation  including interest    operating leases      total      balance includes million of icelandic krona isk denominated lease obligations which are variable based on the exchange rate of the isk versus the us dollar and also this amount is subject to periodic adjustments based on the icelandic consumer price index icpi 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the isk and us dollar exchange rate would result in an increase or decrease of our annual lease payments of million 
a hypothetical basis point increase of the icpi would result in an increase or decrease of our annual lease payments of million 
under the terms of certain technology licensing agreements  decode is obligated to make payments upon the achievement of established milestones leading to the discovery of defined products 
these payments could total million  with the timing of payments not determinable at the current time 
these potential payments are not included in the above table 
in november  decode adopted a change in control benefits plan that provides for  among other things  upon a change in control  all outstanding stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights  and any similar awards under any equity compensation plan of decode  shall vest  become immediately exercisable or payable and have all restrictions lifted 
in the event of a change in control  the plan also requires decode to make a lump sum payment to the ceo and reporting officers based on their most recent salary and bonus history 
also  the plan requires other benefits to be paid  to include life  disability  accident and health insurance for these employees for a period of to months depending on employment 
decode believes that it is unlikely that these circumstances will transpire  as such no charge has been recognized in its statements of operations 
further  these potential payments are not included in the above table 
as of december   the potential minimum lump sum payment salary and bonus amounts only under these change in control provisions would have totaled approximately million calculated as of december  all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
we do not have any other significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
additionally  holders of our senior convertible notes may elect to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at any time at a price of per share 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to revenue recognition  property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  materials and supplies  derivative financial instruments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the estimates referred to above 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
collaborations and revenue our collaborative arrangements and the recognition of revenue in such arrangements is the accounting policy most critical to us 
a substantial portion of our revenues relate to funded research collaborations 
our revenues from research and development collaboration agreements are recorded and recognized in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of the respective contracts  generally either i as contract research costs are incurred  usually ratably over the period of effort  ii according to the level of efforts expended based on the ratio of contract research costs incurred to expected total costs  or iii upon the achievement of substantive milestones 
our accounting recognition policies with respect to each significant element of our revenue is summarized as follows research funding and other service fees 
research funding is recognized as earned  typically ratably over the period of effort 
funding payments are not refundable in the event that the related efforts are not successful 
other service revenues from negotiated rate contracts are recognized based upon the terms of the underlying contract generally either i on a per diem basis as services are rendered  ii on the basis of efforts expended  generally upon the ratio of costs incurred to total expected costs of providing the service  or iii upon completion of the service rendered 
any losses on contracts are provided for when they are determinable 
included in revenue are billings to customers for the cost of materials purchased by decode 
milestone payments 
under the substantive milestone method decode records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and decode recognizes revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator 
milestone payments without the above characteristics are recognized on a retrospective basis over the contractual term of the underlying agreement 
in arrangements with multiple elements  if the milestone is substantive in nature and there is uncertainty in the achievement of the milestone and there is no further obligation on the part of decode  decode records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and decode recognizes revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator milestone payment method 
if the milestone is earned and there is further obligation under the contract for performance by decode  then decode will record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and decode retroactively recognizes revenue through the current period based on the total contractual term and amortizes the balance over the remaining contractual term 
up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees 
we recognize revenue from non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process ratably over the expected customer relationship period or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
if our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens  the amount of revenue we recognize from such non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known  future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
revenue estimates are reviewed and revised throughout the lives of our contracts and are made based upon current facts and circumstances 
if changes in these estimates or other material adjustments to revenue are identified  the adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions will be recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
investments at december   we held investments in auction rate securities ars with original purchase principal values totaling million  of which million is classified as non current investments on our balance sheet 
as of december   we had million invested in ars  which were classified as current investments on our balance sheet 
except for the remaining million of these securities we have reduced our holdings of ars during through the auction process and further reduced it by million subsequent to year end by selling  at par value  the ars security classified in current investments at december  the non current investments in ars held by us are private placement securities with long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction process at pre determined calendar intervals  generally each month 
this mechanism generally allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value

consistent with our investment policy guidelines  all of the ars investments were rated as investment grade at least a or better at the time of purchase and subsequent to year end remain rated as investment grade 
based on a third party valuation  the estimated market value of our non current investments in ars at december  was million  which reflects an million adjustment to the principal value of million 
although the ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on the valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we have recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended december   reflecting the portion of ars holdings that we have concluded have an other than temporary decline in value and this charge is included in other non operating income and expense  net in our statements of operations 
we have recognized an unrealized loss of million for those ars for which we believe the loss is temporary 
the securities for which we believe the loss is temporary total million of principal  are collateralized by pools of asset and mortgage backed securities and investment grade corporate debt  and are guaranteed by investment grade  monoline insurers 
due to the present lack of observable market quotes for the non current investments in ars  decode engaged a third party to value these securities at december  the valuation models we use to value the ars include those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation of our investments in ars is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict

if uncertainties in these credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience additional downgrades on our investments  we may incur additional impairments unrealized  even realized to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flows and reported earnings 
while the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets is impacting our financial flexibility  we do not believe the conditions will have a material impact on our cash flows or our ability to fund our operations during the fiscal year long lived assets  goodwill and intangibles we periodically review property and equipment  goodwill and intangibles for potential impairments and to assess whether their service lives have been affected by continued technological change and development 
there were no events in  and that triggered an impairment review nor did our annual review of goodwill indicate any recoverability issues 
should we determine that there has been an impairment of our fixed assets  goodwill or other intangible assets in the future we would suffer an increase to our net loss or a reduction of our net income in the period such a determination is made 
should we determine that the pace of technological change or other matters dictate that we change the service lives or other estimates inherent in determining the carrying values of our long lived assets  there will be an impact on depreciation expense from the date of the change 
litigation and other contingencies we consider litigation and other claims and potential claims or contingencies in preparing our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated 
in doing so  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes with respect to legal and other matters as well as potential of probable losses 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
changes or developments in the relevant action or our strategy in such proceedings could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
since the recognition of a loss is dependent upon factors not completely in the control of management  timing of a charge  if any  is difficult to predict with certainty 
share based payments we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our and equity incentive plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which we adopted effective january  we elected to use the modified prospective application in adopting sfas r and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the adoption date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
stock option awards and restricted stock units generally vest over a three to four year period and expense is ratably recognized over those same time periods 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price  as well as the input of other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected term of stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property eitf  was issued 
eitf prescribes the accounting for collaborations 
it requires certain transactions between collaborators to be recorded in the income statement on either a gross or net basis within expenses when certain characteristics exist in the collaboration relationship 
eitf will be effective for all of decode s collaborations existing after january  on december   statement of financial standard no 
r  business combinations sfas r  was issued 
this standard will require an acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies  at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in addition  an acquiring company is required to capitalize in process research and development and either amortize it over the life of the product  or write it off if the project is abandoned or impaired 
the standard is effective for transactions occurring on or after january  on june   eitf accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf  was issued 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments made for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized until such time as the related goods are delivered or services are performed  at which point the amounts would be recognized as an expense 
this standard is effective for new contracts entered into after january  decode is evaluating the impact  if any  this eitf will have on its financial statements 
on september   statement of financial standard no 
fair value measurement sfas  was issued 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard is effective january  for decode 
decode is evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements 
sfas no

 partial deferral of the effective date of statement fsp no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financials statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  decode has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its financial statements 
on february   statement of financial standard no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  was issued 
this standard permits us to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements 
this standard is effective january  for decode 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds  asset backed debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  due to the nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s convertible notes  because they bear interest at a fixed rate 
the market value of the senior convertible notes was approximately million on december  as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
we continue to monitor our exposure to currency risk 
a hypothetical decrease in value of the us dollar against the icelandic krona would result in a loss of approximately million on our icelandic krona denominated non us dollar assets and liabilities 
we have historically purchased instruments to hedge these general risks through the use of derivative financial instruments  however  we have no derivative instruments outstanding as of december  at december   we held investments in auction rate securities ars with original purchase principal values totaling million  of which million is classified as non current investments on our balance sheet 
as of december   we had million invested in ars  which were classified as current investments on our balance sheet 
except for the remaining million of these securities we have reduced our holdings of ars during through the auction process and further reduced it by million subsequent to year end by selling  at par value  the ars security classified in current investments at december  the non current investments in ars held by us are private placement securities with long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction process at pre determined calendar intervals  generally each month 
this mechanism generally allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
we generally invest in these securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
however  the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of our remaining ars in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders and this has resulted in multiple failed auctions 
our non current investments in ars represent interests in debt obligations  namely life insurance wrapped issues  of companies offering credit derivatives  and of entities on which monoline insurers retain capital put rights

consistent with our investment policy guidelines  all of the ars investments were rated as investment grade at least a or better at the time of purchase and subsequent to year end remain rated as investment grade 
based on a third party valuation  the estimated market value of our non current investments in ars at december  was million  which reflects an million adjustment to the principal value of million 
although the ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on the valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we have recorded an impairment charge of million in other non operating income and expense  net in our statements of operations for the year ended december   reflecting the portion of ars holdings that we have concluded have an other than temporary decline in value 
we have recognized an unrealized loss of million for those ars for which we believe the loss is temporary 
the securities for which we believe the loss is temporary total million of principal  are collateralized by pools of asset and mortgage backed securities and investment grade corporate debt  and are guaranteed by investment grade  monoline insurers 
due to the present lack of observable market quotes on the non current investments in ars  decode engaged a third party to value these securities at december  the valuation models used to value the securities include those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation of our investments in ars is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact the valuation include changes in credit ratings of the securities or their guarantors  underlying collateral value  discounts rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
our apparent losses increased million million other than temporary and million temporary during the first two months of according to the third party valuation 
if uncertainties in these credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience additional downgrades on our investments  we may incur additional impairments unrealized  even realized to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flows and reported earnings 
while the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets is impacting our financial flexibility  we do not believe the conditions will have a material impact on our cash flows or our ability to fund our operations during the fiscal year as of december  we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet
