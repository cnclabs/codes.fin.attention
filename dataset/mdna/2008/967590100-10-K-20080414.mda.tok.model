overview widepoint corporation widepoint or the company is a technology based provider of product and services to both the government sector and commercial markets 
we specialize in providing systems engineering  information technology services and information assurance in the form of identity management services 
our subsidiary  operational research consultants  inc orc  is the leading provider of e authentication federal credential and federal compliant public key infrastructure pki managed services to the federal government 
we intend to grow over the next few years through a combination of organic growth  the acquiring of selective strategic assets and by operational efficiencies among our subsidiaries 
in january  we acquired isys  llc  a united states federal contractor with specific services in mobile telecom management services  forensic informatics  and information assurance 
widepoint was incorporated in delaware on may  our staff consists of business and computer specialists who help our government and civilian customers augment and expand their resident technologic skills and competencies  drive technical innovation  and help develop and maintain a competitive edge in today s rapidly changing technological environment in business 
our organization emphasizes an intense commitment to our people  our customers  and the quality of our solutions offerings 
as a services organization  our customers are our primary focus 
we have developed thorough  comprehensive policies  procedures and controls to mitigate the threat  or potential threat  of intentional  unintentional  physical  natural or electronic compromise or disruption of any portion of our systems or services 
the talent and technology are available  and the resident expertise experienced in working together  to ensure goals are achieved quickly and seamlessly 
contract instruments are already in place and a substantive reference base with an assortment of federal agencies are available 
on october   we completed the acquisition of orc 
orc specializes in it integration and secure authentication processes and software  and providing services to the united states government 
orc has been at the forefront of implementing pki technologies 
pki technology is rapidly becoming the technology of choice to enable security services within and between different computer systems utilized by various agencies and departments of the us government 
based on asymmetric key cryptography  pki technology uses a class of algorithms in which a user can receive two electronic keys  consisting of a public key and a private key  to encrypt any information and or communication being transmitted to or from the user within a computer network and between different computer networks 
the user provides his or her public key to any and all desired persons or entities 
the user does not share the private key with anyone else 
the public key will encrypt all information and or communication from any sender and the private key will allow only the holder of the private key to unlock and decrypt such information and or communication 
thus  the algorithms used in pki technologies help to achieve authentication of users and information  integrity of all data and communications  non repudiation or rejection of data and communications  and support confidentiality of data and communications 
pki also speeds up and simplifies the delivery of products and services by providing electronic approaches to processes that historically have been paper based 
these electronic solutions depend on pki for identification and authentication  data integrity  confidentiality of information and transactions  and non repudiation to facilitate mission related transactions internal to an organization and with external organizations 
orc is currently designated by the united states government as an external certificate authority for the us government 
as such  orc is authorized to issue all permissible certificate types and services in accordance with defense information systems agency and national security agency standards  necessary for the interoperable  secure exchange of information between us governmental agencies  contractors  and international allies such as members of nato 
over the past several years widepoint focused on the consolidation of its recent acquisition of orc  accelerating the rollout of the orc e authentication and pki identity management initiatives  and continuing to implement our project based enterprise strategy  emphasizing our industry wide best practices disciplines 
with the addition of the customer base and the increase in revenues attributable to the orc acquisition  widepoint s opportunity to leverage and expand further into the federal marketplace improved dramatically 
orc s past client successes  top facility security clearances  security personnel expertise  and additional breadth of management talent have expanded our reach into markets that previously were not accessible to widepoint 
we intend to continue to market and sell our technical capabilities into the governmental and commercial marketplace 
further  we are continuing to actively search out new synergistic acquisitions that we believe may further enhance our present base of business and service offerings  such as our recent acquisition of isys llc in january that augments our prior acquisition of orc 
the company s revenues for the period ending december  decreased by approximately from approximately million in to million in this decrease was materially attributable to a reduction in revenues in our consulting services segment that was not wholly offset by the growth in revenues in our pki credentialing and managed services segment 
our pki credentialing and managed services segment experienced revenue growth of approximately with revenues increasing approximately  from approximately  for the year ended december   to approximately  for the year ended december   as a result of continuing adoption of the federal government s hspd program and the continuing adoption of the department of defense external certificate program eca program 
in the long term we anticipate that our pki credentialing and managed service segment should continue to increase as we witness further adoption of the eca program and the homeland security presidential directive number hspd program is increasingly adopted by the federal government agencies and departments 
in the short term we do anticipate a greater variability in revenue growth as we move from the pilot to the full deployment stage in programs with several federal government initiatives associated with the department of defense  the department of homeland security  and several other state and local government programs 
based upon estimates provided by independent analyst and us government estimates  management believes there is a base of several million of users for the company s pki services that is comprised of us federal government agencies employees and their contractors 
the company further believes that there is a developing market place for pki credentials within the state and local governments and other national programs that extend beyond the us federal government agencies  employees and their contractors 
these other opportunities relate to the requirements underlying the mandates for the hspd program that effect state and local governments as well as other national programs 
the company s credentials are currently priced on government pricing schedules depending upon the quantity purchased and the level of managed services and support selected by the customer 
pricing of the company s credentials by user are driven by a competitive marketplace and may change at any time 
the company believes it is well positioned to effectively compete within this market segment as a result of its past successes and experience within the pki field 
our consulting services segment experienced decreasing revenues of approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was materially the result of a reduction in the sale of software associated with the various hspd programs that did not re occur in as a result of budget delays  as well as to a reduction in consultants billable hours in in  there were two sales of oem software to a single customer that aggregated to approximately  that did not recur in the reduction in billable hours in as compared to was a result of difficulties in sourcing candidates for available open positions with the necessary skills throughout the year 
as the company attempts to implement its strategy of strategic growth driven both by internal growth and potential merger and acquisition activity  we believe that future performance may continue to affect the comparability of the information reflected in the selected consolidated financial information presented above 
a number of factors  including the progress of contracts  revenues earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of the pass through of other direct costs  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts  the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions may subject our revenues and operating results to significant variation from quarter to quarter 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
with our acquisition of orc and our subsequent acquisition of isys in january  we rely upon a larger portion of our revenues from the federal government directly or as a subcontractor 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date  our clients may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
such suspensions may cause us to realize lower revenues in the fourth quarter and or first quarter of the year 
further  a change in presidential administrations and in senior government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases and implements the services that we offer 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance as no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a possible material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  most of widepoint s current costs consist primarily of the salaries and benefits paid to widepoint s technical  marketing and administrative personnel 
as a result of our plan to expand widepoint s operations through a combination of internal growth initiatives and merger and acquisition opportunities  widepoint expects such costs to increase 
widepoint s profitability also depends upon both the volume of services performed and the company s ability to manage costs 
as a significant portion of the company s cost is labor related  widepoint must effectively manage these costs to achieve and grow its profitability 
to date  the company has attempted to maximize its operating margins through efficiencies achieved by the use of its proprietary methodologies  and by offsetting increases in consultant salaries with increases in consultant fees received from its clients 
the uncertainties relating to the ability to achieve and maintain profitability  obtain additional funding to partially fund the company s growth strategy  and to provide the necessary investment to continue to upgrade its management reporting systems to meet the continuing demands of the present regulatory changes may also affect the comparability of the information reflected in the financial information presented above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
widepoint believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonably based upon information available to it at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  the company s financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that widepoint believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  intangibles  accounting for income taxes  stock based compensation 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with its audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
revenue recognition the majority of widepoint s revenues are derived from cost plus  or time and materials contracts 
under cost plus contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred and include an estimate of applicable fees earned 
for fixed price contracts  revenue is generally recorded as delivery is made 
for time and material contracts  revenues are computed by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
in the event of a termination of a contract  all billed and unbilled amounts associated with those task orders where work has been performed would be billed and collected 
the termination provisions of the contract would be accounted for at the time of termination 
any deferred and or amortization cost would either be billed or expensed depending upon the termination provisions of the contract 
further  the company has had no material history of losses nor has it identified any specific risk of loss at december  due to termination provisions and thus has not recorded provisions for such events 
the company also recognizes revenue including multiple element arrangements  in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
and eitf revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
revenue is recognized as specific elements indicated in sales contracts are executed 
if an element is essential to the functionality of an arrangement  the entire arrangement s revenue is deferred until that essential element is delivered 
the fair value of each undelivered element that is not essential to the functionality of the system is deferred until performance or delivery occurs 
the fair value of an undelivered element is based on vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value as appropriate 
if an undelivered element exists  the company will determine the fair value of the undelivered element and subtract the fair value of the undelivered element from the total consideration under the arrangement 
the residual amount is the company s estimate of the fair value of the delivered element 
costs associated with inconsequential or perfunctory elements in multiple element arrangements are accrued at the time of revenue recognition 
the company s other revenues are derived from the delivery of non customized software 
in such cases revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists generally a purchase order has been received or contract signed  delivery has occurred  the charge for the software is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
allowance for doubtful accounts widepoint determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligations  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based on these factors and provide allowances for these receivables when collections become doubtful 
provisions are made based on specific review of all significant outstanding balances 
because of the company s history of minimal credit losses and the nature of the company s customers at the time  no allowance for doubtful accounts was believed necessary at december  or at december  goodwill goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets acquired 
the company has adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards require the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  set forth the accounting for the initial recognition of acquired intangible assets and goodwill and describe the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill subsequent to initial recognition 
under the provisions of these standards  goodwill is not subject to amortization and annual review is required for impairment 
the impairment test under sfas no 
is based on a two step process involving i comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value and ii comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the company s annual impairment testing date is december goodwill is a significant item on the company s balance sheet and represents approximately of our total assets as of december  goodwill is identified on the face of the balance sheet 
intangibles the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  intangible assets are recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
each asset is continually evaluated by management to determine if its carrying value will be realized based upon the estimated discounted cash flow expected from the asset 
additional amortization is recognized in the period a decline in value is identified 
the company also recognizes an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights  or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
the application of purchase accounting to a business acquisition requires that the company identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each 
the intangibles recognized in the acquisition are amortized over the company s estimate of their useful lives 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company reviews its long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
as of december   the company is not aware of any known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or the assumptions the company has used to value long lived assets 
long lived assets are a significant item on the company s balance sheet and represent approximately of our total assets 
any impairment as a result of the estimate utilizing undiscounted net cash flows to determine the assumed value of long lived assets could have a significant impact on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
long lived assets are identified on the face of the balance sheet as intangibles 
amortization of intangibles is identified on the face of the statement of operations within cost of sales 
specific intangibles arose as a result of the company s acquisition of orc 
the company allocated approximately   net book value at december  to customer list and relationships and  to goodwill 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of the accounting estimates relating to the purchase accounting for the orc acquisition  the amortization period of the acquired intangibles and the lack of impairment of the assets  and the md a disclosure regarding those estimates  with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
also  the company engaged mp s valuations to perform an independent analysis to provide a qualified opinion on the company s methodology and calculations in determining the related intangibles valuations associated with the purchase accounting for the orc acquisition 
accounting for income taxes widepoint accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts  and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company has incurred historical net operating losses  or nols  for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  no federal income tax provision has been recorded to date and there are no taxes payable 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the level of historical losses that may limit utilization of nol carry forwards in future periods  management is unable to predict whether these net deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to expiration 
the unused nol carry forwards expire in years through as such  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
widepoint believes that its estimates are reasonable  given the lack of historical earnings and the fact that there may be significant limitations placed on the use of the nol carryforwards 
there is  however  a significant possibility that the company will have sufficient income in the future to utilize substantial portions of the deferred tax assets 
no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is described above 
such a change in the estimate reflected in the historical income tax provisions could have a material effect on the income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
stock based compensation the company adopted sfas r effective january   which requires recognition of compensation expense for all stock option or other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the option s effective date 
the company elected the modified prospective application transition method of adoption and  as such  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
under this method  the fair value of all stock options granted or modified after adoption must be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and total compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized  as determined under the original provisions of sfas  must also be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as vesting occurs 
as part of our implementation  management has established assumptions required for a basis of determining the fair value of stock options as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
management believes the results and conclusions relating to the assumptions  including  expected term  volatility  risk free interest rate  and dividend rate are reasonable based on historical trends and expected future events 
management is not aware of any matters that would materially alter the assumptions used in the valuation of the stock options under the black scholes option pricing model 
the forfeiture rates utilized in conjunction with the recognized stock compensation expense is reasonable and reflective of the expected rates for potentially cancelled  unvested stock options 
stock based compensation recognized during the period is properly stated and calculated as promulgated by sfas r 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  a decrease of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was materially attributable to decreased sales associated with consulting services and software  partially offset by increased sales associated with the rollout of contract awards in support of the federal government s hspd mandate and the dod s eca program 
our pki credentialing and managed services segment experienced revenue growth of approximately with revenues increasing  from approximately  for the year ended december   to approximately  for the year ended december   as a result of continuing adoption of the federal government s mandate under hspd and the continuing adoption of the eca program by the department of defense and its federal contractors 
in the long term we anticipate that our pki credentialing and managed services sales should continue to increase as we witness the continued adoption of the eca program by the department of defense federal contractors and the hspd program is increasingly adopted by the federal government agencies and departments 
in the short term we do anticipate a greater variability in revenue growth as we either await contract awards that have been delayed or as certain pilot programs expand to fully implemented programs in support of the hspd initiative 
our consulting services segment experienced decreased revenues of million from approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was materially the result of a reduction in the sale of software associated with the various hspd programs that did not recur in as a result of budget delays  along with a reduction in consultants billable hours in in  there were two sales of oem software to a single customer that aggregated to approximately  that did not recur in the reduction in billable hours in as compared to was a result of difficulties in sourcing candidates for available open positions with the necessary skills throughout the course of the year 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december   was approximately million  or of revenues  a decrease of approximately million below cost of sales of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the absolute dollar decrease in cost of sales was materially attributable to lower revenues while the improvement in the gross profit margin was materially attributable to an improvement in the sales mix of higher margin services 
the proportion of pki products and services in was of total revenue compared to of total revenue in the pki products and services generate higher profit margins for the company 
the cost elements related to consultant salaries  benefits and expenses at both orc and widepoint are substantially similar 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december   was approximately million  or of revenues  a decrease of  as compared to gross profit of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of revenues  as compared to approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the slight increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of sales and marketing expenditures for additional labor as a result of increased bid and proposal efforts related to the expansion of our pki managed services segment 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to the recognition of lower employee stock options expense of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for year ended december   was approximately  or less than of revenues  an increase of  as compared to approximately  of such expenses  or less than of revenues  recorded by the company for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expenses for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to the increased pool of depreciable assets 
interest income expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income in was primarily attributable to greater amounts of available cash and other securities 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  as compared to  of interest expense for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense in was primarily attributable to capital lease purchases by orc 
income tax benefit 
there was no income tax benefit for  as compared to an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of net loss 
as a result of the above  the net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million  an increase of million  as compared to the net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the following table sets forth selected segment and consolidated operating results and other operating data for the periods indicated

liquidity and capital resources the company has  since inception  financed its operations and capital expenditures through the sale of preferred and common stock  seller notes  convertible notes  convertible exchangeable debentures  senior secured loans and the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants related to a convertible exchangeable debenture 
during and  operations were primarily financed with working capital  senior debt  and stock option and warrant exercises 
cash used by operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash balances available for operating activities for the year ended december   was primarily a result of a reduction in accounts payable and deferred revenues 
capital expenditures in property and equipment were approximately  excluding any capital leases for the year ended december   as compared to capital expenditures in property and equipment of approximately  excluding capital leases for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a secured credit facility with protexx  a pki software and services company with which we have a strategic business relationship 
the credit facility for approximately  was fully utilized and drawn down through december  the credit facility is collateralized by all of the assets of protexx 
during the first quarter of  the credit facility was extended until june  and increased to  the facility bears interest at simple interest 
the company had decreases in its balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivables  prepaid expenses  and intangibles  offset by an increase in property and equipment and other assets  with decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and deferred revenue  further offset by increases in capital lease obligations as of december  as compared to december  the decrease in assets and decrease in the liabilities in the company s balance sheet were primarily due to the reduction in revenues in as compared to as of december   the company had net working capital of approximately million 
widepoint s primary source of liquidity consists of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of accounts receivable 
current liabilities include approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the company s business environment is characterized by rapid technological change  experiencing times of high growth and contraction  and is influenced by material events such as mergers and acquisitions that can substantially change the company s performance and outlook 
the company requires substantial working capital to fund the future growth of its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable  sales and marketing efforts  and capital expenditures 
there are currently no material commitments for capital expenditures 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending for new product and service development  technological changes and market acceptance of the company s services 
widepoint believes that its current cash position is sufficient to meet capital expenditure and working capital requirements through however  the growth and technological change of the market make it difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
over the longer term  the company must successfully execute its plans to increase revenue and income streams that will generate significant positive cash flows if it is to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources 
additionally  a major expansion might require external financing that could include additional debt or equity capital 
in january  the company acquired isys llc with proceeds of approximately million from the company s credit facility with cardinal bank 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  for future acquisitions and or growth initiatives 
on january   the company entered into a commercial loan agreement with cardinal bank relating to a  revolving credit facility and a  term loan 
advances under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the prime rate plus and the repayment date for such facility is april  this new revolving credit facility replaces the company s prior  revolving credit facility with cardinal bank

under the terms of the membership interest purchase agreement  jin kang also entered into an employment and non compete agreement  dated as of january  the subsequent credit facility and acquisition will increase the amount of debt and interest expense the company will need to support  along with corresponding increases in assets and estimated proforma projected revenues and profits from operations 
for the fiscal year ended december   isys is projected to have approximately million in revenues and net income of approximately million dollars 
the estimated proforma financials representing both the company and isys for the period ending december  reflects pro forma revenues of approximately million and pro forma positive cashflows for such year after allowing for interest expense from the increased debt service of the credit facility to acquire isys
