use of non gaap financial measures direct contribution  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are measures used by management to evaluate operating performance 
adjusted ebitda is also used to determine our compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments 
direct contribution is defined as net sales  less cost of product sold  selling and service expenses  marketing expenses  research expenses and capital charges an internal non gaap charge based on trade accounts receivable  inventories and equipment specifically identifiable to each of our operating segments 
ebitda is defined as net earnings plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges  as permitted under our senior discount note  senior note and senior subordinated note indentures and our senior credit facility 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and minority interest charges 
direct contribution provides investors with the measurement used by our management to evaluate the performance of our segments 
we believe ebitda is useful to the investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
we consider the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants 
we believe free cash flow provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash for the repayment of debt 
direct contribution  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are not recognized terms under us gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
direct contribution is reconciled to consolidated earnings before income taxes and minority interests in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the most direct comparable gaap financial measures of each other non gaap financial measure  as well as the reconciliation between each other non gaap financial measure and the gaap financial measure  are presented in the discussions of the non gaap financial measures below 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  including chemicals and equipment  is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership and all risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer  which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided to the customer 
significant estimates used in recognizing revenues include the delay between the time that chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by customers and title transfers and the amount of credit memos to be issued in subsequent periods 
we provide our chemical and equipment offerings to our customers using various commercial arrangements  but the following are most commonly used ship and bill arrangements 
following the receipt of a purchase order from the customer  we invoice the customer at the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped  based on agreed pricing and the volume of chemicals shipped or units of equipment shipped 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the product and the risks of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  adjustments to revenues and cost of product sold are made to account for the delay between the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
our sales policy does not provide for general rights of return and does not contain customer acceptance clauses 
usage with level billing arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer 
as agreed with the customer  a fixed amount is invoiced monthly based on this estimate 
at the end of each quarter  we reconcile the actual amount of chemicals used by the customer and bill the customer for products actually used during that period 
revenue is recognized to reflect actual usage 
for any products not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period  we retain ownership of such products on a consigned basis and do not recognize any revenue 
fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer during the contractual period  which is usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  typically monthly 
we retain ownership  on a consigned basis  of any inventory at the customer site that is not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period 
revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period  which is generally consistent with the customer s usage of the chemicals 
under these arrangements  as part of the sales cycle for our chemical programs  our technical and sales representatives may visit our customers facilities to develop and monitor the chemical programs 
typically  there is no contractual obligation for these visits  or any penalty for not visiting the customer sites 
during these visits  our employees perform routine testing activities to ensure that our chemical products functionalities are having the desired effect on the customers equipment eg  boilers  chillers and water treatment plants 
in the majority of instances  our customers perform the on going application of the chemicals 
at the same time  the sales representatives investigate and determine whether the customers have needs for additional applications from nalco 
we consider our technical and sales representatives activities in this regard to be an integral and inherent part of our selling process and not a separate del iverable for revenue recognition purposes 
some of our customers  however  look to us for our technical expertise only  without the purchase of chemicals equipment 
we offer specialized services designed to assess  control  and reduce risk from water borne pathogens such as legionella  and we provide other technical and analytical services 
we invoice for our services using various commercial arrangements  but the following arrangements are the most common perform and bill arrangements 
revenue is recognized in the same period that the related service is performed  based on the agreed pricing  which can be either a price per hour or a fixed fee 
fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we estimate the saleable service that will be performed during a given period  usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  which may be monthly  quarterly  or annually  either in arrears or in advance of the services provided 
because an unspecified number of similar acts are performed within a fixed period of performance  revenue is recognized ratably over the period of performance 
time and material arrangements 
the fee with the customer is structured on a time and material basis  and revenue is recognized in the same period that the work is completed 
in certain arrangements  which are usually reserved for our largest customers  we provide some combination or all of the following deliverables chemicals  equipment and on site technical expertise 
in these arrangements  we usually remain the owner of any equipment at the customer site 
at the end of the contractual relationship  the equipment is either recovered or sold to the customer or a competitor 
additionally  our representatives may have a regular presence at a customer s facility  which is provided under a contract 
over time  the representatives have gained a true expertise in the particular production water treatment process at the customer s facility  and are able to selectively apply our specific chemical programs given the customer environment water quality  equipment type  etc the regular presence of the representative permits us to closely track the results of the program and to make modifications to the program as necessary for the highest efficiency 
the following two types of commercial arrangements are the most commonly used for the sale of multiple deliverables production based arrangements 
our billing is based on a customer s production based formula eg  dollars per ton of paper produced within certain technical parameters 
we use a combination of our service chemicals  on site technical expertise and equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
the chemicals and equipment used and on site technical expertise required are highly correlated with the customer s production 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the production based formula 
usage based arrangements 
for these arrangements  we invoice according to the consumption of chemicals by the customer 
the agreed price by kilogram or pound of chemical consumed also includes the availability of on site expertise and the use of equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the usage based formula 
for all of our commercial arrangements  we also record estimated reserves for anticipated non collectible accounts and for product returns and other credits at the time revenue is recognized 
impairment of long lived assets other than intangibles we conduct periodic reviews for idle equipment and review business plans for possible impairment implications 
porta feed stainless steel containers  utilized to ship chemicals  represent approximately of our property  plant and equipment and are managed globally to optimize the delivery of chemicals to customer and company sites around the world 
due to their high mobility  there is a risk that porta feeds could be damaged or lost in transit 
we perform continuous cycle counts of our porta feeds and when such counts are inconsistent with our tracking system  we investigate the discrepancy in order to locate the container 
if the porta feed is not found  we write off the asset immediately 
we capitalize qualifying costs incurred in the acquisition and development of software for internal use  including the costs of the software  materials  consultants  interest and payroll and payroll related costs for employees dedicated to the development 
we must use our judgment in determining whether the direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and an employee s time and travel expenses directly associated with developing software are recoverable and should be capitalized 
we base our determination on the nature and the extent of the activity that the employee is performing 
a significant portion of our capitalized software costs relates to our sap implementation 
goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually and when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying values of intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for possible impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we have defined our reportable segments as our reporting units for our goodwill accounting 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated using a combined market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we test the carrying value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the carrying value 
fair value is estimated using a relief of royalty approach  a discounted cash flow methodology 
the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions could impact whether an impairment charge is required and  if so  the amount of such impairment 
future outcomes may also differ 
if we fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  experience unfavorable market conditions or achieve results that differ from our estimates  then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may be required to recognize impairment charges 
pensions accounting for pensions involves the selection of a discount rate and an expected rate of return that we apply to a market related value of plan assets 
this methodology generally reduces the volatility of pension expense that would have otherwise resulted from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities 
each year s expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate  thereby generating the overall discount rate for us pension obligations 
the discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets 
in those countries where developed co rporate bond markets do not exist  the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds 
the assets in the principal domestic pension plan are diversified across equity and fixed income investments 
the investment portfolio has target allocations of approximately equity  fixed income and alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity 
other assets such as real estate may be used judiciously to enhance portfolio returns and diversification 
the expected long term rate of return is established using historical market data for each asset class as well as the target allocation 
historical markets are analyzed and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income investments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility will generate a greater return over the long run 
active management is employed in most asset classes  which also contributes to the return assumption 
the total weighted average return on each asset class supports our long term expected rate of return assumption 
we review our long term rate of return assumptions annually 
while we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years in determining pension expense 
other postretirement benefits accounting for other postretirement benefits requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of our future postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities 
each year s expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate  thereby generating the overall discount rate for our other postretirement benefit obligations 
we develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and discussions with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies 
income taxes we estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which has been further clarified by interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
this results in our recording deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet to recognize the temporary differences caused by the timing of recognition of income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
valuation allowances are recorded based on the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
relevant fact ors to determine the realizability of the assets include future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes 
valuation allowances are established for those assets that are determined to be more likely than not to expire without benefit  or for which income of the proper character is not anticipated 
the effect of a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset that is expected to originate in the current year is included in the annual effective tax rate for the year 
the effect of a change in the beginning of the year balance of a valuation allowance resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs 
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal  state and international jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations  and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken 
however  these positions are subject to audit and review by the tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations  we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest for amounts that do not meet the more likely than not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by fin the tax reserves are reevaluated throughout the year  taking into account new legislation  regulations  case law and audit results 
environmental our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use and handling of hazardous substances  waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar services  some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party  or prp  by the environmental protection agency or state enforcement agencies at five waste sites where some financial contribution is or may be required 
these agencies have also identified many other parties who may be responsible for clean up costs at the waste disposal sites 
our financial contribution to remediate these sites is expected to be minor 
there has been no significant financial impact on us up to the present  nor is it anticipated that there will be in the future  as a result of these matters 
we have made and will continue to make provisions for these costs if our liability becomes probable and when costs can be reasonably estimated 
we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances  including multi party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services 
while we do not believe that based upon present information that any of these suits will be material to us  there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
historically  our expenditures relating to environmental compliance and clean up activities have not been significant 
the environmental reserves represent our current estimate of our proportional clean up costs and are based upon negotiation and agreement with enforcement agencies  our previous experience with respect to clean up activities  detailed review of known conditions  and information about other prps 
the reserves are not reduced by any possible recoveries from insurance companies or other prps not specifically identified 
although given the evolving nature of environmental regulations  we cannot determine whether or not a material effect on future operations is reasonably likely to occur  we believe that the recorded reserve levels are appropriate estimates of the potential liability 
although settlements will require future cash outlays  it is not expected that such outlays will materially impact our liquidity position  although there can be no assu rance that such impacts could not occur 
executive level overview we generated solid sales and profit growth in  even as second half profitability was constrained by continuing problems in europe and by product and other cost increases late in the year 
sales for the year ended december  grew to  million from  million  including organic sales growth 
we define organic growth as nominal  or actual  sales growth less the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures 
net earnings rose to million from million in diluted earnings per share eps increased to cents per share from the year earlier cents 
earnings benefited from a fourth quarter insurance settlement from the hurricanes that resulted in a million improvement to adjusted ebitda and a million increase in net earnings  or cents per share 
this gain was offset in net earnings and eps by a million expense for a grant of nonvested common stock as part of an agreement with our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
william h 
joyce 
dr 
joyce retired effective december for purposes of adjusted ebitda  this expense was neutral as it was added to ebitda as part of other unusual charges 
adjusted ebitda increased to million in the year ended december  from million in energy services led organic growth for the year  up on continued strength in oilfield and downstream businesses 
industrial and institutional services i is grew led by rapid growth in asia  latin america and several north american markets including our power  mining and food and beverage business units 
paper services revenues were essentially flat 
other segment sales declined as good organic growth in our katayama nalco joint venture in japan and modest gains in india were more than offset by a sizable drop in an integrated channels group that pursues opportunistic sales 
nearly of our sales came from business units growing at a average organic rate 
direct contribution margins expanded in energy services from to for the year  even as the business continued to invest heavily in hiring and training sales engineers to support new business capture for start up in i is direct contribution margins contracted percentage points to due to increased investment in organic operating expenses in europe that did not translate into organic growth for the region 
paper services direct contribution margins held relatively flat  with a modest percentage point dip as declining results in europe offset solid performance improvement in the americas 
across the company  sales in every region grew at least organically except the european region  which declined organically for the year 
north america was up  asia and latin america organically 
profitability in europe declined more sharply as operating expense investments in growth areas were not offset by revenue growth and profits in other parts of europe 
on december   we acquired an interest in mobotec usa naming our new entity nalco mobotec 
cash paid for this acquisition  net of cash acquired  was million 
additional value to the selling shareholders may be paid through earn out clauses that will be treated as compensation if targets are reached 
during the days nalco mobotec was part of the company  it added million to sales and million to ebitda 
nalco mobotec provides industrial and power utility customers with a wide range of solutions that save energy and reduce many critical pollutants  including greenhouse gases  nitrogen and sulfur oxides nox sox  mercury  hydrogen chloride and particulates 
this business fits well in our strategic focus on providing customers with sustainable solutions or solutions that combine economic  environmental and social benefits 
free cash flow was million for the year ended december   even with a sizable  unplanned increase in receivables and a decision to accelerate pension funding 
this was an increase of over the million of free cash flow generated in net cash provided by operating activities is reconciled to free cash flow as follows

we moved forward pension funding from into by nearly million following the august release of new rules under the pension protection act of for the year  pension funding exceeded expense levels by more than million 
days sales outstanding dso increased by days to days during following implementation of new order to cash work processes and systems that had been intended to shrink dso  among other benefits 
these changes  made as part of an initiative we called nalco business transformation nbt  are expected to deliver productivity improvements and enhanced cash generation over time 
however  during  we only gained a small portion of the productivity gains we expect  and added more than million to working capital with the dso increase 
our waste coal agglomeration  or synfuel business  accounted for million in sales and million in direct contribution for i is during in  revenues were million and direct contribution was million

outlook in  we expect to deliver a solid improvement in results 
although some of the world s economies face weakening trends  we provide critical water treatment offerings that are needed almost independent of the business cycle 
our products and services generate energy and water savings that are all the more valuable in high energy cost environments 
process applications that depend more on customer production levels are highly concentrated in the strong upstream and downstream energy industries  along with the solid mining industry

increasing company wide focus on generating free cash flow 
we are moving to fold this into regional and business objectives across the company  and are making free cash flow targets an element of our management incentive plans 
as we look to  our expectations for adjusted ebitda take into account the expiration of the synfuel business 
without synfuels  sales would have been billion and adjusted ebitda would have been million 
during  adjusted ebitda is targeted to grow at an or better pace from that million base 
we are more cautious in our outlook than we have been in the past because of the time needed to drive improvements in europe  product cost increase potential and our typical one quarter lag in recovering these cost increases through our own pricing actions  and the potential for modest recession impacts 
what had been insurance recovery in will begin to be replaced by operating earnings as gulf of mexico platforms approach more normal levels of activity 
further  over time  we expect to replace earnings emanating from synfuels  beginning with the exciting addition of mobotec  and with other growth strategies under development 
this expected level of adjusted ebitda performance would translate into diluted eps growth of greater than before considering the effect of any further share repurchase activity 
free cash flow growth is expected to be substantial in importantly  we expect to have fixed our receivables challenge 
bringing down our dso to year end levels will generate in excess of million 
this should offset the increase in receivables that would have been expected based on planned revenue growth 
added to higher cash earnings  free cash flow is expected in the high million range 
this remains a fundamentally sound business with a strong growth profile 
while we are not immune to our customer s economic conditions  we are cushioned against difficult economic conditions by our ability to save our customers energy  water  capital requirements and other input costs 
in addition  some of the improvements we will capture in build on money spent in results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of over the  million reported for the year ended december  on an organic basis  which excludes the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures  net sales were up 
organic growth was reported by every geographic region except europe  where sales declined modestly 
gross profit  defined as the difference between net sales and cost of product sold  of  million for the year ended december  rose million  or  over the  million for on an organic basis  gross profit increased by 
contributing to the improvement was the impact of higher sales volumes and cost savings  which were partly offset by higher product and freight costs rising late in the year 
a million business interruption insurance settlement from the gulf hurricanes that we received in the fourth quarter also benefited the current year 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  selling  administrative  and research expenses for the year ended december  of  million increased million  or  from  million for the year ended december  organically  selling  administrative  and research expenses were up million  or 
nearly three fourths of this increase was attributable to selling expense  which was mainly resulted from higher salaries  employee incentives  employee benefits  training  travel  and outside services 
administrative expenses rose million on an organic basis 
the increase was primarily driven by a million expense for a grant of nonvested common stock as part of an agreement with our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
william h 
joyce  who retired effective december  partly offset by lower incentive plan expense s 
amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower amortization of customer relationships  which are amortized using an accelerated method 
business optimization expenses  representing mostly employee severance and related costs associated with the continuing redesign and optimization of business and work processes  were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
current year expenses included million of non cash charges that resulted from some share based payments to exiting executives  who were not replaced 
other income expense  net was a net expense of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the million unfavorable difference was mainly attributed to lower earnings by our affiliate entities and higher franchise taxes and other miscellaneous charges  which were partly offset by a favorable change in foreign currency transaction gains and losses of million 
net interest expense  defined as the combination of interest income and interest expense  of million for the year ended december  increased by million from the million reported for the year ended december  translation rate changes due to the weaker us dollar versus the euro increased interest expense by million  and accretion of our senior discount notes was million higher than a year ago 
the net impact of a lower average debt level and higher interest rates on our variable rate debt compared to the year ago period partly offset these increases 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the rate varies from the us federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the incremental us federal income tax on dividends received from non us subsidiaries  foreign taxes provided at other than the us statutory rate  us state income taxes  nondeductible expenses  and other permanent differences between income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
the aforementioned items also contributed to the variation between the us federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  the year ended december  also included two discrete events related to our tax positions in the netherlands 
during the period  we completed our consultations with the tax authorities regarding their analysis of certain interest deductions incurred by two of our dutch subsidiaries 
the tax effect of these interest deductions represented million of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the dutch tax authorities concluded that all of the interest deductions we considered at risk were valid deductions under the applicable law 
therefore  we reversed an existing tax reserve  and reduced tax expense during the year by million 
in addition  we determined that certain net loss carryforwards in the netherlands are likely to expire without being utilized 
therefore  we established valuation allowances on those losses  which resulted in million of additional tax expense during we also implemented various foreign reorganizations in that provided tax savings during  and are expected to provide on going savings in future years 
minority interest expense was million higher than the million for the year ended december  higher earnings by most of our non wholly owned subsidiaries  most notably saudi arabia and japan  accounted for the increase

organically  direct contribution improved  as a result of the organic increase in sales 
operating expenses were up organically  mostly due to increased salaries  employee incentives  employee benefits  travel  bad debt expenses  and capital charges  which factor in the balance sheet impacts of the division s customer consigned inventory and receivables 
in europe  higher organic operating expenses did not result in organic growth in sales 
the energy services division reported direct contribution of million for the year ended december   a increase over the million reported for on an organic basis  direct contribution rose 
higher sales volume and improved margins accounted for the increase despite investments in additional manpower for new business in eastern europe and the middle east that will generate sales beginning in operating expenses were up organically  with the largest increases in salaries  employee incentives  employee benefits  travel  outside services  and capital charges 
the paper services division reported direct contribution of million for the year ended december   a increase over the direct contribution of million reported for the year ended december  organically  direct contribution was down  as improved results in the americas were more than offset by a significant decline in europe and a more modest decrease in asia 
operating expenses were up organically 
salaries  employee incentives  employee benefits  training  travel  and outside services increased as bad debt expenses decreased 
the direct contribution loss of million reported in other for the year ended december   represented an increase of million from the million direct contribution loss reported in  which was mostly attributable to an unfavorable change in raw material purchase price and manufacturing spending and volume variances 
a million business interruption insurance settlement from the gulf hurricanes that we received in the fourth quarter partly offset these changes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were  million  an increase from the  million reported for the year ended december  on an organic basis  net sales were up 
of this improvement  was attributed to price increase  while the remaining was driven by real growth  which we define as organic growth less price increases that are passed on to simply recover higher costs 
gross profit  defined as the difference between net sales and cost of product sold  of  million for the year ended december  increased by million  or  over the  million for the year ended december  on an organic basis  gross profit increased by 
higher sales volume and the impact of higher selling prices  partly offset by the effect of increased costs of raw and other purchased materials  contributed to this change

gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for selling  administrative  and research expenses for the year ended december  of  million increased million  or  from  million for the year ended december  on an organic basis  selling  administrative  and research expenses increased 
slightly less than half of this increase was attributable to selling expense  which was primarily due to higher salaries  commission expenses  employee benefits  bad debts  and outside services 
administrative expenses increased from due to higher employee incentive plan expenses  employee benefits  and outside consulting related to our work process redesign initiatives and the rationalization of our legal entity structure 
amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower amortization of customer relationships  which are amortized using an accelerated method 
business optimization expenses  representing mostly employee severance and related costs associated with the continuing redesign and optimization of business and work processes  were million for the year ended december  business optimization expenses were million for the year ended december   which included a million charge to support a plan to de layer our management structure and reduce costs in lower performing business units 
other income expense  net unfavorably changed by million from the net other income of million for the year ended december  an unfavorable change in foreign exchange gains and losses of million due mostly to the weakening of the us dollar versus the euro during accounted for most of the variation 
net interest expense  defined as the combination of interest income and interest expense  of million for the year ended december  increased by million from the million reported for the year ended december  the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate borrowings more than offset the impact of a lower average debt level compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective tax rate for the year ended december  of 
the reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily caused by the growth in pretax earnings and the restructuring of our foreign operations to facilitate the tax efficient repatriation of cash to the us minority interest expense was million higher in than the million for the year ended december   reflecting improved results for our non wholly owned subsidiaries in spain  saudi arabia  and japan

on july   our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  and gave our management discretion in determining the conditions under which shares may be purchased from time to time

we are highly leveraged 
our liquidity requirements are significant  primarily due to debt service requirements as well as research and development and capital investment 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flow generated from operations  but we also have availability under a million revolving credit facility and a million receivables facility  in each case subject to certain conditions 
we believe that our financial position and financing structure will provide flexibility in worldwide financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions in credit markets 
senior credit facilities 
our revolving credit facility is part of our senior credit facilities that were entered into on november  our senior credit facilities initially included a million term loan a facility including an million tranche maturing on november  and a  million term loan b facility maturing on november  borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a floating base rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan a facility range from to with respect to base rate borrowings and to with respect to libor or eurocurrency borrowings depending on our leverage ratio as defined by the facilities 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan b facility is with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor or eurocurrency borrowings 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan b facility is not subject to adjustment 
in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior credit facilities  we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments at a rate equal to 
we also pay customary letter of credit fees 
the term loan a facility was scheduled to amortize each year in quarterly amounts at a rate of per annum in year one  per annum in year two  per annum in year three  per annum in year four and per annum in each of years five and six 
in addition to the million of scheduled payments due for the year ended december   we repaid an additional million using cash generated from operations and proceeds from our former accounts receivable securitization facility 
an additional million  million and million was repaid during the years ended december   and  respectively  using cash provided by operations

we repaid an additional million during using cash from operations  and an additional million was repaid during  using mostly cash provided by operations 
principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will be due and payable in full at maturity on november  as of december   we had borrowed million under the revolving credit facility  which was classified as short term debt because of our intent to repay it in the senior credit facilities contain a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  our ability and our subsidiaries ability  including nalco company  to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  repay other indebtedness  pay dividends and distributions or repurchase certain capital stock  create liens on assets  make investments  loans or advances  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  amend certain material agreements governing our indebtedness  change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries including nalco company and enter into hedging agreements 
in addition  the senior credit facilities require nalco company to maintain the following financial covenants a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum capital expenditures limitation 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  senior discount notes  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
as part of the transactions  in november  nalco company issued million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior subordinated notes due on january   our subsidiaries  nalco finance holdings llc and nalco finance holdings inc  issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due prior to february   interest will accrue on the notes in the form of an increase in the accreted value of such notes 
the accreted value of each note will increase from the date of issuance until february  at a rate of per annum  reflecting the accrual of non cash interest  such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount at maturity on february  cash interest payments on the notes will be due and payable beginning in our primary source of liquidity for such payments will be cash flow generated from the operations of subsidiaries  including nalco holdings and nalco company 
however  the terms of nalco company s senior credit agreement limit the amount of dividends and other transfers by nalco holdings and our other subsidiaries to the issuers of the senior discount notes 
in addition  the terms of certain of the indentures governing the existing senior notes and senior subordinated notes of nalco company significantly restrict nalco company and our other subsidiaries from paying dividends  making distributions and otherwise transferring assets to the issuers 
the ability of nalco company to make such payments is governed by a formula bas ed on its consolidated net income 
in addition  as a condition to making such payments to the issuers based on such formula  nalco holdings must have an adjusted ebitda to interest expense ratio of at least to after giving effect to any such payments 
notwithstanding such restrictions  such indentures permit an aggregate of million of such payments to be made whether or not there is availability under the formula or the conditions to its use are met 
in december  nalco finance holdings llc and nalco finance holdings inc redeemed a portion of the senior discount notes with an accreted value of million using proceeds from the initial public offering of common stock of nalco holding company 
the issuers paid a million premium to redeem the notes 
after the partial redemption  the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the notes declined to million from million 
the indentures governing the senior discount notes  the senior notes and senior subordinated notes limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to

spacer 
gif 
sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
subject to certain exceptions  the indentures governing the senior discount notes  the senior notes and senior subordinated notes permit our restricted subsidiaries and us to incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness 
covenant compliance 
the breach of covenants in our senior credit agreement that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda could result in a default under that agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under our indentures 
additionally  under our debt agreements  our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is used to determine our compliance with many of the covenants contained in the indentures governing the notes and in our senior credit agreement 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures and our senior credit facility 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants 
adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows

our senior credit facility requires us to maintain an adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio which started at a minimum of x and a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio which started at a maximum of x  in each case for the most recent four quarter period 
failure to satisfy these ratio requirements would constitute a default under the senior credit agreement 
if our lenders failed to waive any such default  our repayment obligations under the senior credit agreement could be accelerated  which would also constitute a default under our indentures 
our ability to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under our indentures  subject to specified exceptions  is tied to an adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio of at least to  except that we may incur certain debt and make certain restricted payments and certain permitted investments without regard to the ratio  such as up to an aggregate principal amount of  million including million that was outstanding under our term loan facilities as of december  and investments in similar business and other investments equal to of nalco holding company consolidated assets 
local lines of credit 
certain of our non us subsidiaries have lines of credit to support local requirements 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these local lines of credit was approximately million 
certain of these lines of credit are equally and ratably secured with obligations under our senior credit facilities 
receivables facility 
in june  nalco company entered into a three year accounts receivable securitization facility with a commercial paper conduit sponsored by jpmorgan chase bank  one of the lenders under nalco company s senior credit facilities  which provided up to million in funding 
when that facility expired in june  nalco company entered into a new three year facility with a commercial paper conduit sponsored by bank of america  na  one of the other lenders under nalco company s senior credit facilities 
the new facility provides up to million in funding  based on availability of eligible receivables and satisfaction of other customary conditions 
under the facility  pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement  nalco company the seller sells trade accounts receivable the receivables to nalco receivables llc the transferor  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose limited liability company 
pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement  the transferor then transfers an undivided interest in the purchased receivables to the commercial paper conduit or the related bank sponsor the transferees in exchange for cash 
the transferor s purchase of receivables from the seller is financed through the simultaneous transfer of this undivided interest in the purchased receivables  together with cash contributed to it by nalco company and the advances made by the seller under an intercompany note 
nalco company  as the receivables collection agent  services  administers and collects the receivables under the receivables transfer agreement for which it receives a monthly servicing fee at a rate of per annum of the average daily outstanding balance of receivables 
borrowings under the receivables facility bear interest at a floating base rate plus a program fee 
the program fee varies based upon our leverage ratio as calculated under the senior credit facilities and is currently of the amount funded 
in addition  the transferor is required to pay a facility fee that varies based upon the same ratio and is currently of million 
these rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders on the monthly settlement date 
availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance from time to time 
aggregate availability is determined by using a formula that reduces the gross receivables balance by factors that take into account historical default and dilution rates  excessive concentrations and average days outstanding and the costs of the facility 
based on the terms of this facility and on the criteria described above  as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable balance was considered eligible for financing under the program  of which approximately million would have been available for funding 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this facility  based on the amount of receivables eligible for financing as of november  this facility is treated as a general financing agreement resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility being recorded as interest expense 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from our contractual obligations as of december

our contractual obligations and commitments over the next several years are significant 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flow generated from operations 
in the period january  through december   our cumulative cash flow from operations was million 
we have availability under a million revolving credit facility to assist us  if required  in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 
this multi year revolving credit facility matures in november if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness

we believe that cash flow generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be adequate to meet our obligations and business requirements 
our ability to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors  and the cost of litigation claims  among other things

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted the provisions of fin as o f january   as required 
the adoption of fin decreased total assets and total liabilities by million and million  respectively  and increased shareholders equity by million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
this statement indicates  among other things  that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
sfas no 
defines fair value based upon an exit price model 
relative to sfas no 
 the fasb has issued fasb staff positions fsp and fsp amends sfas no 
to exclude sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions  while fsp delays the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we are required to adopt the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
for financial assets and financial liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually as of the beginning of our fiscal year ended december  we have evaluated sfas no 
and do not expect that it will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes are to be reported in comprehensive income and as a separate component of shareholders equity 
sfas no 
does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net earnings 
we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as of december   as required 
based on the funded status of our plans as of december   the adoption of sfas no 
decreased total assets by million  decreased total liabilities by million and reduced shareholders equity by million 
we will change our measurement date to our december year end from the current measurement date of november in  as required 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment in retained earnings 
subsequent to adopting sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
we are required to adopt sfas no

r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
r retains the underlying concepts of sfas no 
in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but sfas no 
r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived in tangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r would also apply the provisions of sfas no 
r 
early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that sfas no 
r may have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with earlier adoption prohibited 
this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
the statement also amends certain of arb no 
s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of sfas no 
r 
this statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
we are currently evaluating sfas no 
and anticipate that it will not have a significant impact on the reporting of our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments as necessary to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we manage foreign currency exchange risk arising from financial activities pursuant to our corporate guidelines 
forward contracts and  occasionally  swaps and options are utilized to protect these cash flows from adverse movements in exchange rates  and we account for these instruments by marking them to market at each balance sheet date 
we may also employ hedge accounting as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in addition  we use certain foreign currency debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our net investment in foreign operations 
upon issuance  we designated the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  and the million term loan as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose assets  liabilities  and operations are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the euro denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment 
accordingly  changes in the value of the euro denominated debt are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  to offset changes in the value of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose financial statements are measured using the euro as their fun ctional currency 
we formally assess  on a quarterly basis  whether the euro denominated debt is effective at offsetting changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash pretax loss in the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment account related to this hedge 
no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in income 
we also manage operational transactional foreign currency risk  particularly in emerging markets  by closely managing both pricing and raw material sourcing 
risks associated with foreign exchange translation exposures are not hedged 
we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our derivative foreign currency instruments outstanding at december  and  a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which those derivative foreign currency instruments are denominated would result in a gain or loss in fair values of less than million and million  respectively 
at december   nalco company s forecasted natural gas utility requirements were approximately hedged utilizing natural gas forward contracts at an average cost of per mmbtu 
these contracts had a notional value of million and have delivery dates from january through december based on year end nymex prices  we had a net unrealized loss on our natural gas forward contracts at december  of million 
assuming that year end natural gas prices were to increase or decrease by  the gain or loss in fair value would be approximately million 
at december   we had  million of variable rate debt 
a increase in the average interest rate would increase future interest expense by approximately million per year 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of the changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not reflect the effect of such changes on the related hedged transactions or on other operating transactions 
the analysis also does not factor in a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevailed 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the derivative financial instruments 
we limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to satisfy fully their obligations under the contracts 
we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and do not use them for speculative or trading purposes
