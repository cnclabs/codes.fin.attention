item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section entitled risk factors of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel orally administered small molecule drugs that modulate ion channel targets 
utilizing our proprietary know how and integrated scientific and drug development capabilities  we have identified multiple drug candidates that modulate ion channels 
we are conducting research and development activities  in some cases in collaboration with leading pharmaceutical companies  in a number of disease areas  including epilepsy  asthma  pain and inflammation 
since our incorporation in november  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of drug candidates with activity at ion channels 
we currently have two clinical development programs  as well as other drug discovery programs addressing specific ion channel targets 
we have not received approval to market any product and  to date  have received no product revenues 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses and accumulated deficit have resulted from the significant costs incurred in the research and development of our compounds and technologies and general and administrative costs 
we expect that our operating losses will continue and likely increase substantially for at least the next several quarters and years as we continue to expand our research  development and clinical trial activities and infrastructure 
a substantial portion of our revenue for at least the next several years will depend on our achieving development and regulatory milestones in our existing collaborative research and development program and entering into new collaborations 
our revenue may vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year 
our operating expenses may also vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year based on the timing of clinical trial patient enrollment and our research activities 
in particular  as we advance ica and the other lead compounds that we are developing for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain and as we pursue the development of senicapoc  formerly ica  for the treatment of asthma  we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of our future performance 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
we estimate that we will incur at least approximately million over the course of the next two years to complete phase i trials and  if the phase i results are favorable  initiate phase ii trials of ica for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain  and at least approximately million over the course of the next two years to complete phase i trials and  if the phase i results are favorable  initiate phase ii trials of senicapoc for the treatment of asthma 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated expenses of the efforts necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows will commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  
table of contents future clinical trial results  the expense of clinical trials for additional indications  the success of our collaboration with pfizer  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  the expense of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
however  we do not expect to generate product revenue for at least the next several years 
if any of our programs experience delays or do not result in a commercial product  we would not generate revenue from that program in a timely manner or at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our collaboration agreements contain multiple elements  including non refundable upfront license fees  payments for reimbursement of research and development costs  payments for ongoing research and development  milestone payments associated with achieving development  regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales  if any 
we consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the elements are separable  whether there are determinable fair values and whether there is a unique earnings process associated with each element of a contract 
we record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue and recognize revenues as services are performed over the applicable term of the agreement 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the agreement  we estimate the period based upon other factors contained within the agreement 
we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period and the timing and the amount of revenue recognized 
when a payment is specifically tied to a separate earnings process  we recognize revenues when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of 
table of contents significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related program  such as the initiation or completion of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and receipt of approvals by regulatory agencies 
revenues from milestone payments may be considered separable from funding for research and development services because of the uncertainty surrounding the achievement of milestones for products in early stages of development 
accordingly  we can recognize these payments as revenues if and when the performance milestone is achieved if they represent a separate earnings process as described in emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf in connection with our research and development collaborations  we recognize revenues from non refundable upfront license fees  which we do not believe are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the agreement 
with respect to our collaboration with pfizer  this period is the initial two year research term of the collaboration 
with respect to our collaboration with mcneil  this period is the estimated service period of the agreement  which initially was through the expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the agreement in due to the termination of the agreement as of september   we revised our estimate of the substantive service obligations of the contract from june to september to coincide with the september  contract termination date 
accordingly  we recognized the remaining million unamortized balance of the million upfront license and milestone payment from mcneil as revenue during the year ended december  research and development services provided under our collaboration agreement is on a fixed fee basis 
we recognize revenues associated with long term  fixed fee contracts based on the performance requirements of the agreements and as services are performed 
our collaboration agreement with pfizer allows for research term extensions upon mutually agreeable terms 
we recognize revenues from contract extensions as we perform the extended services 
we also recognize revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research and development costs associated with our cost sharing arrangement with mcneil  which terminated on september  we reflect the associated research costs in our research and development expense 
in connection with our collaboration with pfizer  pfizer paid us an initial upfront license fee of million 
we are recognizing this payment from pfizer as revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  eitf and other relevant accounting literature 
specifically  we recorded the million upfront payment as deferred revenue  which we are amortizing to revenue over the two year life of the research term 
in connection with our collaboration with mcneil  mcneil paid us an initial upfront payment of million  and a milestone payment of million upon acceptance of the protocol for our phase iii clinical trial of senicapoc for sickle cell disease by the fda 
we recognized these payments from mcneil as revenue in accordance with sab  eitf and other relevant accounting literature 
specifically  we recorded both the million upfront payment and the million milestone payment as deferred revenue  which was amortized to revenue over the estimated life of the agreement  which initially was estimated to conclude on the expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the agreement in  but was revised to the termination of the agreement as of september  at the time of the execution of the agreement  we did not consider the achievement of the milestone above to represent a separate earnings process  and therefore we elected to treat this payment in a manner consistent with the accounting treatment applied to the million upfront payment rather than recognize this payment as revenue when received 
none of the payments that we have received from collaborators to date  whether recognized as revenue or deferred  are refundable even if the related program is not successful 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service 
table of contents performed and the associated cost incurred for such service where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we make these estimates as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees payable to contract research organizations in conjunction with clinical trials  fees payable to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at each reporting period end 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expense includes  among other things  clinical trial costs 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to our contract research organizations for trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
our cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  these changes in estimates may result in a material change in our clinical study accrual  which could materially affect our results of operations 
research and development expense includes those costs described under financial operations overview research and development expense below 
stock based compensation effective january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
revised  share based payments  or statement r 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time vested stock options are retained before being exercised  or the expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately expire or be forfeited 
changes to these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized on the statements of operations 
accounting for income taxes under our income tax policy  we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  including orphan drug credit carryforwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets as  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in the event that we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period the determination is made 

table of contents as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million for income tax purposes that begin to expire in the year our orphan drug credit carryforwards of million as of december  for income tax purposes begin to expire in the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited based upon changes in ownership pursuant to regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code 
financial operations overview revenue we do not currently have any commercial products for sale and do not anticipate having any commercial products for at least the next several years 
to date  our revenue has been derived solely from our collaborations with pfizer  mcneil  bristol myers squibb  astellas and abbott laboratories 
the aggregate revenues that we have recognized from our collaborators for research and development in each of the last three years were as follows million  million  and million 
during the year ended december   revenues from our collaborators accounted for the following percentages of our total net revenues mcneil and pfizer 
currently  we are only receiving research funding under our collaboration with pfizer 
research funding under our collaboration with mcneil ended on september   research funding under our collaboration agreements with abbott ended on december   and research funding under our collaboration agreements with bristol myers squibb and astellas ended in in connection with our collaboration with pfizer  pfizer paid us an initial upfront payment of million 
we are recognizing this payment from pfizer as revenue over the two year initial term of the collaboration in accordance with sab  eitf and other relevant accounting literature 
in connection with our collaboration with mcneil  mcneil paid us an initial upfront payment of million  million of which we paid to cmcc in  and a milestone payment of million upon acceptance of the protocol for our phase iii clinical trial of senicapoc by the fda   of which we paid to cmcc in our collaboration agreement with mcneil terminated effective september  we recognized these payments from mcneil as revenue in accordance with sab  eitf and other relevant accounting literature 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to contract research organizations in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  upfront license fees and milestone payments under in licensing agreements  consulting  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and depreciation of capital assets used to develop our products 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
our collaborators have paid for a portion of our research and development expenses in each of the last three years 
we expect that 
table of contents research and development expenditures will continue to increase substantially during and subsequent years due to clinical studies of ica for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain  clinical studies of senicapoc for asthma  and the continued development of our research programs 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources for several projects 
consistent with our target class approach to drug development  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified project  but instead are directed to broadly applicable research efforts 
accordingly  we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we cannot state precisely the total costs incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical projects on a project by project basis 
senicapoc for asthma  and formerly senicapoc for sickle cell disease  and ica and our other lead compounds for epilepsy and neuropathic pain represent a substantial majority of the total research and development payments by us to third parties 
the following table shows  for the periods presented  the total out of pocket payments made by us to third parties for preclinical study support  clinical supplies and clinical trials associated with these programs year ended december  development program in thousands senicapoc ica and other lead compounds for epilepsy and neuropathic pain total we expect that a substantial percentage of our research and development expense in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our drug development programs toward eventual commercialization of a drug product  we test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and efficacy 
we then conduct clinical trials for each drug candidate 
throughout the drug development process  we make submissions to  and engage in discussions with  drug regulatory authorities  with the ultimate goal of submitting to these authorities and having approved applications for marketing approval 
if we do not establish a collaboration for the program  we fund these activities ourselves 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for some product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
completion of clinical trials by us or our collaborators may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a drug candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the duration of patient follow up  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
none of our drug candidates has received fda or foreign regulatory marketing approval 
during the first quarter of  our pivotal phase iii trial of senicapoc for the treatment of sickle cell disease was terminated 
in order to achieve marketing approval  the fda or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that our or our collaborators clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of the drug candidates 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization 
table of contents of some of our products  such as our active collaboration with pfizer and our past collaborations with mcneil  bristol myers squibb  astellas and abbott 
in situations in which third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date is largely under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements will affect our development plan or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
however  we do not expect to generate product revenue for at least the next several years 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving finance  accounting  intellectual property  information technology  human resource and administrative functions 
other costs include facility costs not included in research and development expense  insurance  professional fees for legal  accounting and public relations services and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection for our intellectual property 
we expect that general and administrative expenditures will increase during and subsequent years due to increasing payroll  public company expenses  our initial commercialization expenses if we receive marketing approvals  business development costs and expanded operational infrastructure 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on equipment debt financing 
other income other income consists of sublease income from space we are not currently occupying 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  collaborative research and development revenue collaborative research and development revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase reflects an increase of approximately million in revenue resulting from the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue due to the termination of the mcneil collaboration and a million increase in revenue due to the pfizer collaboration  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million due to reduced research and development fees and reduced cost sharing reimbursement from the mcneil collaboration for the clinical development of senicapoc for the treatment of sickle cell disease 
research and development expense research and development expense decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease of million in expense related to the development of senicapoc for the treatment of sickle cell disease  a decrease of  in depreciation expense and a decrease of  related to relocation and recruiting expenses  offset by an increase of million in expense related to the development of ica

liquidity and capital resources on february   we completed an ipo of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on march   the underwriters purchased an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to an over allotment option 
our net proceeds from the ipo  including the over allotment option and after deducting underwriter s discounts and commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million 
on february   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the private placement resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
in june  we received notification from mcneil of its termination of the collaboration agreement between us and mcneil for the development of senicapoc for the treatment of sickle cell disease as of september  consequently  we did not earn any revenue associated with this collaboration after september  we are bearing the full cost of development of senicapoc for asthma 
in august  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer for the discovery  development  manufacture and commercialization of compounds and products that modulate three specific sodium ion channels as new potential treatments for pain and related disorders 
pursuant to the collaboration arrangement  pfizer paid us an initial upfront license fee of million 
in addition to the upfront license fee  pfizer is providing us with research and development funding over a two year research period pursuant to the agreement 
pfizer is obligated to make payments to us upon achievement of specified research  development  regulatory and commercialization milestones of up to million for each drug candidate developed 
we are also eligible to receive tiered royalties  against which pfizer may credit any commercialization milestones  based on specified percentages of net product sales 
in august  in connection with the collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer  we also entered into a purchase agreement with pfizer to sell to pfizer up to million of our common stock 
in a first closing of the transaction on august   we sold  shares of common stock to pfizer at a price of per share  which was the closing bid price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global market as of pm eastern time on the business day preceding the execution of the purchase agreement  resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
in a subsequent closing of the transaction on february   we sold an additional  shares of common stock to pfizer at a price of per share  which was the closing bid price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global market as of pm eastern time on the business day preceding the date of our exercise of our put option to sell the shares  resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
we have financed our operations since inception through the issuance of equity securities  payments received under our collaboration agreements with pfizer  mcneil  bristol myers squibb  astellas and abbott  
table of contents proceeds from equipment debt financing and capital leases and interest income 
from inception through december   we have raised net proceeds of million from our ipo  private equity financings and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
from inception through december   we have also received million in license fees and research and development funding  million in proceeds from equipment debt financing and capital leases and million in interest income 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
cash flows at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of one year or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions and united states government obligations 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  this reflects a net loss of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million in deferred revenue and a decrease of approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these amounts were partially offset by million of non cash expenses related to stock based compensation  million of non cash expenses related to impairment of technology licenses  a decrease of approximately million in prepaid expenses and other current and non current assets   of non cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and  of non cash expenses for amortization of technology licenses 
net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million and consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities   in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and  in proceeds from equipment debt financing  partially offset by  in principal repayments related to our equipment debt financing 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  this reflects a net loss of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million in deferred revenue  an increase of approximately  in prepaid expenses and other current and non current assets  and a decrease of approximately  in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these amounts were partially offset by million of non cash expenses related to stock based compensation   of non cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  a decrease in accounts receivable of  and  of non cash expenses for amortization of technology licenses

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations our long term commitments under operating leases consist of payments relating to our leases of laboratory and office space as well as of office equipment 
these leases expire over the period from to our long term commitments under equipment debt financing consist of payments relating to financing arrangements used primarily for the purchase of laboratory equipment 
we are a party to a number of license agreements  primarily with academic institutions  under which we license patents  patent applications and other intellectual property 
the duration of these agreements varies from years to the expiration date of the last to expire patent  and we have the option to renew some of these agreements at the end of their terms 
our technology license agreements are generally terminable by us upon short notice 
under some conditions  we are permitted to grant sublicenses for which the licensors are entitled to receive a fee  a share of sublicense income or both 
some of these licenses require annual technology license maintenance fees and periodic payments upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones 
we are obligated to pay specified royalties for licensed and sublicensed product sales  and in some cases minimum annual royalties 
the table below does not include contingent milestone amounts payable pursuant to these license agreements 
one of our license agreements is with cmcc 
under this agreement  we are required to pay cmcc royalties on net product sales by us or our affiliates and a share of any sublicense income received by us 
see business intellectual property license agreements above for a description of the cmcc license agreement 
we paid cmcc million of the million upfront payment that we received from mcneil in june  and  of the million milestone payment that we received from mcneil upon acceptance of the protocol for our pivotal phase iii trial of senicapoc for the treatment of sickle cell disease by the fda in february the amount of payments or obligations to cmcc were initially recorded on the balance sheet as long lived assets under the category technology licenses and related costs and were amortized to expense over the term of the agreement 
due to the termination of the mcneil collaboration agreement during  we determined that these long lived assets were no longer recoverable 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we recorded an impairment loss of million during the second quarter of  which is recorded as a component of research and development expense in the statement of operations for the year ended december  the following table summarizes as of december  our contractual obligations for operating leases  equipment debt financing principal and interest payments  annual technology license maintenance fees and other contractual obligations  including minimum annual royalties 
this table should be read in conjunction with the notes accompanying our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
payments due by period total and thereafter in thousands operating leases equipment debt financing annual technology license maintenance fees other contractual obligations total other contractual obligations as of december  consisted of  related to commitments for contract research services for preclinical research and other commitments 

table of contents funding requirements we expect to incur losses from operations for at least the next several years 
in particular  as described above  we expect to incur increasing research and development expense and general and administrative expense in the future 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  including the gross proceeds of approximately million from our private placement completed in february  the million up front license fee from pfizer received in august and the gross proceeds of approximately million from the pfizer equity investments completed in august and february will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses  obligations under our equipment debt financing and capital expenditure requirements through our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and results of our research  preclinical and clinical development activities  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  the success of our collaborations with pfizer and astellas  and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations 
we do not anticipate that we will generate product revenue for at least the next several years 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters and years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
except for collaboration revenue we expect to receive from pfizer as funding for research and development activities over the two year collaboration term  we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
additional equity or debt financing  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
additionally  any future equity funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors
