item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical corporation that was formed in since inception  we have specialized in the discovery and development of prescription pain management products and expect to commercialize products that are successfully developed 
we have a number of product candidates in various stages of development  ranging from preclinical studies to pivotal clinical trials 
our most advanced product candidate  entereg alvimopan  is designed to selectively block the unwanted effects of opioid analgesics on the gastrointestinal gi tract 
for the global development and commercialization of entereg as a monotherapy  we are collaborating with glaxo group limited glaxo in two indications 
we have a pending new drug application nda with the food and drug administration fda for entereg for the proposed indication of acceleration of time to upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis 
the prescription drug user fee pdufa date for that nda is may  we are also developing delta opioid agonists in collaboration with pfizer inc pfizer 
one of the delta opioid agonists is in phase a clinical testing and one is in phase clinical testing 
we have additional product candidates in preclinical development for the treatment of moderate to severe pain conditions 
in april  we announced the results from study  a phase long term safety study of alvimopan entereg in patients taking opioids for chronic non cancer pain and experiencing obd  and the impact those results have on the current development program 
results from study showed numerically more myocardial infarctions and all cardiovascular serious adverse events reported by patients treated with entereg compared to placebo 
the results of study also showed an imbalance in the incidence of neoplasms benign  malignant  skin cancers and unspecified  including polyps  the incidence of malignant neoplasms  and an increase in the incidence of fractures reported in patients receiving entereg  compared to placebo 
in june  the fda placed the alvimopan inds on clinical hold pending submission and analysis of additional information and notification by the fda that clinical studies with alvimopan may resume 
our request for removal of the clinical hold is currently pending 
there can be no assurance the fda will lift the clinical hold on alvimopan inds 
in january  the fda s gastrointestinal drug advisory committee the gidac reviewed entereg for the proposed indication of acceleration of time to upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis 
there can be no assurance that the fda will approve the pending nda for entereg at the may  pdufa date or ever 
in december  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration with pfizer to develop and commercialize adl and adl  proprietary delta opioid receptor agonist compounds for the treatment of pain 
we received an upfront payment of million from pfizer and reimbursement of million for phase development costs for the compounds that we had incurred prior to entering into the collaboration agreement 
the agreement also provides that we may receive milestone payments of up to million for the first compound and million for a second compound 
the milestones payments would become payable upon achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and commercial milestones defined in the agreement 
the first milestone event defined is commencement of phase b clinical testing 
the collaboration agreement provides for the establishment of a joint steering committee to guide the development and commercialization of the products 
we will be responsible for ind filings and phase and phase a clinical studies and pfizer will be responsible for subsequent worldwide development and all regulatory approvals and commercialization of the products 
for development expenses in support of regulatory filings in the united states  the companies share external development expenses with paid by pfizer and paid by us 
expenses for development activities required for regulatory filings outside the united states are the responsibility of pfizer 
upon commercialization 
table of contents of products  we will share in the net profits net losses  as defined in the agreement  in the united states with paid to pfizer and paid to us  and we be entitled to receive royalty payments for net sales as defined in the agreement of products outside of the united states 
we retained an option to co promote the products in the united states 
the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt critical accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by our audit committee 
the principal items in our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows equity based compensation beginning on january   we account for our employee stock option grants under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation in the statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for awards granted after the adoption of sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our stock option grants under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share for as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
collaborative agreement revenues we record deferred revenue for amounts received upfront under collaboration agreements in which we have continuing involvement  and we recognize such deferred amounts as revenue ratably over the estimated contract performance period 
such revenue recognition may be accelerated in the event of contract termination prior to completion of the expected performance period or lengthened if the development period exceeds the initial estimate 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement with glaxo  we received a non refundable and non creditable upfront fee of million 
in  approximately million of the million upfront fee was recognized as revenue 
we expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue through  which represents the revised estimated contract performance period 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement with pfizer  we received an upfront payment of million and reimbursement of million for phase development costs for the compounds that we had incurred prior to entering into the collaboration agreement 
we recognized as revenue in approximately million of the total upfront payment of million 
we expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue over the estimated contract performance period which extends into milestone fees are recorded as revenue when the milestone event is achieved 
amounts reimbursable for costs incurred pursuant to the terms of collaboration agreements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the reimbursable costs are incurred 
such revenues are based on estimates of the reimbursable amount and are subject to verification by the collaborators 
accounts receivable from glaxo and pfizer of approximately million at december  are related to estimated reimbursable expenses for the fourth quarter of  and are subject to verification by glaxo and pfizer 

table of contents research and development expenses we have entered into contracts with third parties to conduct certain research and development activities including preclinical  clinical and manufacturing development activities 
we accrue expenses related to such contracts based upon an estimate of the amounts due for work completed under the contracts 
factors considered in preparing such estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies  materials produced by our manufacturers and other criteria relating to the progress of efforts by our vendors 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of our equity securities  as well as contract revenues 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million at december  and approximately million at december   representing and of our total assets  respectively 
we invest excess cash in united states treasury obligations 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily the result of cash used in operating activities partially offset by cash received from pfizer of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are adequate to fund operations into based upon our expectations of the level of research and development  marketing and administrative activities necessary to achieve our strategic objectives 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information for the year ended december  and year ended december  net loss adjustments for non cash operating items net cash operating loss net change in assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities and operating cash flow requirements outlook overall cash outflows net operating cash outflows of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulted primarily from research and development expenditures associated with our product candidates  including development and manufacturing costs for entereg and our delta programs as well as compensation costs  and marketing  general and administrative expenses 
the outflows were partially offset by payments received under the delta collaboration agreement with pfizer  including a million upfront payment and a payment of million to reimburse us for phase development costs previously incurred 
we expect to continue to use cash resources in to fund operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses in and beyond due to continuing research and development expenses relating to our product development programs 
we also expect to incur increased sales and marketing costs in connection with any launch of entereg 
further  we may license or acquire product candidates which would require additional cash outlays 

table of contents cash outflows internal research and development costs our internal research and development costs for the year ended december  were million after adjustment for non cash compensation and depreciation expenses 
we expect these costs will increase in as we continue to invest in research and development programs and increase headcount 
cash outflows external research and development program costs external program costs totaled million for the year ended december  program activities in may include entereg poi the fda pdufa date for our pending nda filing for entereg is may  the extent of future development expense in and beyond for the program will be determined upon receipt of the fda s decision with respect to our pending nda 
the poi clinical development program is currently on clinical hold 
entereg obd in april  we and glaxo announced the preliminary results from the completed study and also announced the current development program for entereg in obd is on hold while findings from study are evaluated 
future spending associated with this program in near term periods is not estimable at this time 
the obd clinical development program is currently on clinical hold 
combination product program we have no studies ongoing in our combination product program 
the combination product clinical development program is currently on clinical hold 
delta program we completed phase clinical testing of adl and began phase testing in we are conducting phase clinical testing of our second delta compound  adl we estimate overall spending relating to our delta program will increase significantly in  however  of external development expenses will be reimbursed to us pursuant to our december collaboration agreement with pfizer 
cash outflows marketing  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   after adjustment for non cash compensation and depreciation expenses  and we expect that these expenses will increase in in connection with any launch of entereg 
external marketing and sales expenses totaled million in and it is estimated that spending in will also increase significantly in connection with any launch of entereg 
cash flows other we expect cash inflows relating to contract revenues to increase in due to increased expenses incurred by us which are reimbursable by pfizer 
cash inflows relating to interest income are expected to decrease due to declining investment balances 
the year ended december  saw significant reductions in accrued expenses and accounts payable as liability balances were reduced from december  levels through payment of restructuring costs  personnel costs and contracts 
we expect accruals to increase during as a result of increased spending in the areas of research and development and external marketing and sales 
further  we may license or acquire product candidates from others which would require additional cash outlays 

table of contents contractual commitments lease payments future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are as follows year ending december  and beyond glaxo collaboration agreement under the terms of the glaxo agreement  we reimburse glaxo for a portion of certain third party expenses incurred by them relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget which is subject to annual review 
we also incur certain third party expenses ourselves relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  a portion of which are reimbursable to us by glaxo 
we record these expenses as incurred 
pfizer collaboration agreement under the terms of the pfizer agreement  we reimburse pfizer for a portion of certain third party expenses incurred by them relating to our delta opioid agonists  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget which is subject to annual review 
we also incur certain third party expenses ourselves relating to the delta opioid agonists  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  a portion of which is reimbursable to us by pfizer 
we record these expenses as incurred 
other service agreements we have entered into various agreements for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 
license and research agreements in november  roberts licensed from eli lilly certain intellectual property rights relating to entereg 
in june  we entered into an option and license agreement with roberts under which we licensed from roberts the rights roberts had licensed from eli lilly for entereg 
if entereg receives regulatory approval  we are obligated to make an additional milestone payment of million under this agreement  as well as royalties on commercial sales of entereg 
our license to entereg expires on the later of either the date of the last to expire of the licensed eli lilly patents or fifteen years from november  in august  we entered into a separate license agreement with eli lilly under which we obtained an exclusive license to six issued us patents and related foreign equivalents and know how relating to peripherally selective opioid antagonists 
we are subject to clinical and regulatory milestone payments and royalty payments 
table of contents to eli lilly on sales  if any  of new products utilizing the licensed technology 
under this license agreement  we also paid eli lilly million upon acceptance for review of our nda by the fda  which payment was made in the third quarter of in july  we entered into a license agreement with epicept corporation epicept under which we licensed exclusive rights to develop and commercialize in north america a sterile lidocaine patch which we were developing for management of post operative incisional pain 
we made a million payment to epicept upon execution of the agreement and a million payment to epicept in september we discontinued development of the sterile lidocaine patch and terminated the epicept license in the fourth quarter of net cash provided by used in investing activities and investing requirements outlook net cash provided by used in investing activities for the year ended december  and relates primarily to the purchase and maturities of investment securities 
capital expenditures in and were primarily for the purchase of laboratory equipment  furniture and fixtures and office equipment and leasehold improvements associated with our leased facility 
we expect to continue to fund operations through the maturities of investments in our portfolio 
we expect to continue to require investments in information technology  laboratory and office equipment to support our research and development activities  and potential commercialization activities 
net cash provided by financing activities and financing requirements outlook net cash inflows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share in february we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
in addition  we received million from the exercise of stock options in we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  generate product sales revenues  achieve profitable operations or generate positive cash flows from operations  and even if profitable operations are achieved  they may not be sustained on a continuing basis 
we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of entereg  and our potential to achieve revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future is dependent largely upon obtaining regulatory approval for and successfully commercializing entereg  especially in the united states 
although we received approvable letters from the fda for entereg in july and november  there is no assurance that the fda will approve entereg in the future 
we expect to continue to use our cash and investments resources to fund operating and investing activities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million as of december  will be sufficient to fund operations into results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the discussion above under liquidity and capital resources 
contract revenues 
contract revenues were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in expenses incurred by us relating to entereg  and reimbursable by glaxo under the collaboration agreement  of million  a reduction in co promotion revenues of million relating to the arixtra co promotion with glaxo  which is no longer in place and a million reduction in the amortization of the upfront license fee due to the revision to the estimated performance period 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of upfront fees and cost reimbursements associated with the pfizer collaboration of million 
contract revenues decreased in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in co promotion revenues of million relating to the arixtra co promotion with glaxo 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues of million resulting from increased expenses incurred by us relating to entereg and reimbursable by glaxo under the collaboration agreement 

table of contents research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expense  costs of clinical trials  costs to manufacture product candidates  technology licensing costs  laboratory supply costs and facility related costs 
research and development expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to a reduction in costs associated with our entereg program and sterile lidocaine patch program  partially offset by an increase in expenses related to our delta program 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  expenses increased principally due to a greater compensation expense of million relating to the adoption of sfas r and increased expenses associated with our combination product development program and sterile lidocaine patch program 
our research and development expenses can be identified as internal or external expenses 
internal expenses include expenses such as personnel  laboratory and overhead related expenses 
these expenses totaled million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  and are largely related to our development efforts 
external expenses include expenses incurred with clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  and other third party vendors and can be allocated to significant research and development programs as follows year ended december  entereg program combination program sterile patch program delta program other programs total there are significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs 
these studies may yield varying results that could delay  limit or prevent a program s advancement through the various stages of product development  and significantly impact the costs to be incurred  and time involved  in bringing a program to completion 
as a result  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
our marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the expense decrease in was principally related to decreased personnel expenses  including expense primarily associated with the sales force that was disbanded in december  as well as lower marketing and sales expenses 
the expense increase in was principally related to increased personnel expenses  including expenses associated with the implementation of sfas r of million  combined with additional marketing and sales expenses 
interest income 
our interest income decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decrease in short term investments resulting from the use of cash for operations 

table of contents our interest income increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to an increase in short term investments resulting from the proceeds from the sale of common stock in february  in addition to higher interest rates 
other income 
our other income decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and represents cash received from the sale of certain pennsylvania research and development tax credits 
net loss outlook we have not generated any product sales revenues  have incurred operating losses since inception and have not achieved profitable operations 
our deficit accumulated during the development stage through december  aggregated approximately million  and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods 
we expect to continue to use cash resources to fund operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses in and beyond due to continuing research and development expenses and increased spending relating to our product development programs  including the delta programs 
we also expect to incur marketing costs in preparation for the potential commercialization of entereg 
we are highly dependent on the success of our research  development and licensing efforts and  ultimately  upon regulatory approval and market acceptance of our products under development  particularly our lead product candidate  entereg 
we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  generate product sales revenues  achieve profitable operations or generate positive cash flows from operations  and even if profitable operations are achieved  these may not be sustained on a continuing basis 
income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards  which are potentially available to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in and  respectively  if not utilized 
in addition  the utilization of the state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
at december   we also had approximately million of federal and million of state research and development tax credit carryforwards  which begin expiring in  and are available to reduce federal and state income taxes 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we may have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
additionally  because united states and certain state tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal and state income tax purposes 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely 
table of contents than not to be sustained  the tax position is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted fin in and it did not have any impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures on fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified dates 
under sfas  any unrealized holding gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
if elected  the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas we are currently evaluating the potential impact of sfas on our results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  which applies to companies involved in research and development activities that make non refundable advance payments for goods that will be used or for services that will be performed on future research and development activities 
eitf issue requires that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities be deferred and recognized as an expense as goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements  which applies to collaborative arrangements that are conducted by the participants without the creation of a separate legal entity for the arrangements and clarifies  among other things  how to determine whether a collaborative agreement is within the scope of this issue 
eitf issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment assets consist of us treasury obligations 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future  to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  totaled million  and the weighted average interest rate was approximately with maturities of investments ranging up to months
