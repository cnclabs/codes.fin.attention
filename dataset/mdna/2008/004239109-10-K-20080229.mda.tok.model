item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of december   we operated properties  which we own or have an ownership interest in  within our core portfolio or within our opportunity funds i  ii and iii 
these properties consist of commercial properties  primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers and mixed use developments  which are located primarily in the northeast  mid atlantic and midwestern regions of the united states and one multi family property located in southeast region of the united states 
our core portfolio consists of properties comprising approximately million square feet 
fund i has properties comprising approximately million square feet 
fund ii has ten properties  the majority of which are undergoing redevelopment and will have approximately two million square feet upon completion of redevelopment activities 
the newly created fund iii has two properties  which are undergoing redevelopment and will have approximately million square feet upon completion of redevelopment activities 
the majority of our operating income derives from the rental revenues from these properties  including recoveries from tenants  offset by operating and overhead expenses 
as our rcp venture invests in operating companies  we consider these investments to be private equity  as opposed to real estate investments 
since these are not traditional investments in operating rental real estate  the operating partnership invests in these through a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
our primary business objective is to acquire and manage commercial retail properties that will provide cash for distributions to shareholders while also creating the potential for capital appreciation to enhance investor returns 
we focus on the following fundamentals to achieve this objective own and operate a portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed use properties with a retail component located in markets with strong demographics 
generate internal growth within the portfolio through aggressive redevelopment  re anchoring and leasing activities 
generate external growth through an opportunistic yet disciplined acquisition program 
the emphasis is on targeting transactions with high inherent opportunity for the creation of additional value through redevelopment and leasing and or transactions requiring creative capital structuring to facilitate the transactions 
partner with private equity investors for the purpose of making investments in operating retailers with significant embedded value in their real estate assets 
maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth

historical cash flow the following table compares the historical cash flow for the year ended december  with the cash flow for the year ended december  
years ended december  variance dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities totals 
table of contents a discussion of the significant changes in cash flow for versus is as follows the variance in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from an increase of million in operating income before non cash expenses in  which was primarily due to the increase of million in distributions of operating income from unconsolidated affiliates as a result of the distributions from albertson s in as well as those factors discussed in this item in addition  a net increase in cash of million resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily other assets  that was the result of the repayment of notes relating to certain transactions in as well as an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities resulted from million of additional expenditures for real estate acquisitions  development and tenant installations in  million of additional investments in unconsolidated affiliates  primarily citypoint  in  million of additional collections of notes receivable in as well as an additional million of proceeds from sales in and the repayment of million of our preferred equity investment in these net increases were offset by million of additional notes receivable originated in the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted from an increase of million of contributions from partners and members and minority interests in partially owned affiliates in  as well as additional cash of million from borrowings in these increases were offset by an additional million in cash received from the issuance of convertible debt in and an additional million of distributions to partners and members in critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s  gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  we review the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
we perform the impairment analysis by calculating and reviewing net operating income on a property by property basis  we evaluate leasing projections and perform other analyses to conclude whether an asset is impaired 
we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs on properties held for use  we reduce our carrying cost to fair value 
for properties held for sale  we reduce our carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
for the years ended december  and  no impairment losses were recognized 
for the year ended december   an impairment loss of million was recognized related to a property that was sold in july of management does not believe that the value of any properties in its portfolio was impaired as of december  or bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payment on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries and straight line rent 
as of december   we had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
real estate real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for acquisition  development  construction and improvement of properties  as well as significant renovations are capitalized 
interest costs are capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
construction in progress includes costs for significant property expansion and redevelopment 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  the shorter of the useful life or lease term for tenant improvements and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  and identified intangibles such as above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and 
table of contents market economic conditions that may affect the property 
revenue recognition and accounts and notes receivable leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective leases  beginning when the tenant takes possession of the space 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the tenant 
percentage rent is recognized in the period when the tenants sales breakpoint is met 
in addition  leases typically provide for the reimbursement to the company of real estate taxes  insurance and other property operating expenses 
these reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to tenant revenues 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided against certain tenant accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible 
once the amount is ultimately deemed to be uncollectible  it is written off 
interest income from notes receivable is recognized on an accrual basis based on the contractual terms of the notes 
the company reviews notes receivable on a quarterly basis to determine collectability 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements reference is made to the notes to consolidated financial statements which begins on page f of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to our mortgage debt 
see the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for certain quantitative details related to our mortgage debt 
currently  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we had total mortgage debt of million of which million  or  was fixed rate  inclusive of interest rate swaps  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor plus certain spreads 
as of december   we were a party to four interest rate swap transactions and one interest rate cap transaction to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million and million of libor based variable rate debt  respectively 
the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning our long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity and weighted average interest rates of maturing amounts dollars in millions consolidated mortgage debt scheduled weighted average year amortization maturities total interest rate thereafter 
table of contents mortgage debt in unconsolidated partnerships at our pro rata share scheduled weighted average year amortization maturities total interest rate thereafter of our total consolidated and our pro rata share of unconsolidated outstanding debt  million and million will become due in and  respectively 
as we intend on refinancing some or all of such debt at the then existing market interest rates which may be greater than the current interest rate  our interest expense would increase by approximately million annually if the interest rate on the refinanced debt increased by basis points 
interest expense on our variable debt of million as of december  would increase million if libor increased by basis points 
we may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means 
based on our outstanding debt balances as of december   the fair value of our total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates increase by 
conversely  if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million
