the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and 
table of contents on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations  including the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  statement of position  software revenue recognition  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  staff accounting bulletins sab no 
and no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenue  including sales to distributors  when the criteria of sab and sab have been met 
we recognize services revenue when services have been provided and collection of invoiced amounts is reasonably assured 
routine recurring services include terminal repairs  help desk  on site technician visits  deployment and the provision of supplies 
amounts received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues from long term contracts that require substantial performance of customized software and hardware over an extended period are recorded based upon the attainment of scheduled performance milestones under the percentage of completion method 
operating lease revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term 
the cost of units  net of depreciation  leased under operating leases is included in the balance sheet under property  plant and equipment 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables items can be divided into more than one unit of accounting 
an item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items that do not meet these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for one or more of the delivered item s  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in cases in which there is not objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s  we defer all revenue for the arrangement until the period in which the last item is delivered 
share based compensation prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of income 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key 
table of contents assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we also use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation expense  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation expense 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
for stock options with graded vesting terms  we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period on the accelerated method in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option award plans  rather than the straight line method 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options at december  that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
allowance for doubtful accounts payment terms for product and service trade receivables generally range from to days depending on the circumstances of each order or service contract 
payment on trade receivables from long term contracts is generally received within four months of the milestone approval date 
any payments not received within the agreed upon due date are considered past due 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments is maintained 
such allowance is computed based upon a specific customer account review of larger customers with balances past due  and a general reserve for other non reserved balances 
our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  investigation into our customers financial status  as well as consideration of our customers payment history with us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if we determine  based on our assessment  that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay  we will charge off the account receivables to selling  general and administrative expense 
sales type leases certain product sales are made under capital lease arrangements and are recorded as sales type leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
lease contract receivables represent the total lease payments to be received reduced by lease payments already collected 
sales type lease revenues consists of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are earned 
an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio is recorded 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sales type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or customer credit conditions deteriorate  the allowance for uncollectible sales type leases may need to be increased 
unearned income  including an interest and maintenance element  is the amount by which the original sum of the lease contract receivable exceeds the fair value of the equipment sold 
the interest element is amortized to lease income over the lease in a manner that produces a constant rate of return 
the maintenance element is amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognition of the interest and maintenance income did not exceed of our net revenues in  or during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to sell our uk lease business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  adjusted for absorption of manufacturing variances  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record reserves for estimated excess and or obsolete inventory on a product or part level basis based upon future demand and historical usage and establish a new cost basis for the respective item 
product warranty we accrue for estimated warranty obligations when revenue is recognized based on an estimate of future warranty costs for delivered products 
such estimates are based on historical experience and expectations of future costs 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the accrued warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
our warranty period typically extends from one to five years from the date of shipment depending upon the product 
costs associated with maintenance contracts  including extended warranty contracts  are expensed when they are incurred 
actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  intellectual property rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
foreign currency all of our foreign subsidiaries and divisions use the us dollar as the functional currency 
accordingly  foreign currency translation gains and losses from re measurement are included in current earnings 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currency are re measured at period end exchange rates whereas non monetary assets  including inventories and property  plant and equipment  are reflected at historical rates 
during the years ended december   and we recorded gains million  zero and million on re measurement  respectively 
for the same periods we recorded net losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for 
table of contents income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
we do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries because earnings are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
overview of financial results the following overview will highlight certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance over the past three years 
year for  we recorded a net loss of million per share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million 
products revenue increased million or over due to gains achieved principally in emea  as well as the americas with an increase within this segment in mcc  offset by declines in north america 
the increases in product revenue resulted principally from gains in mobile and multi lane products 
services revenue increased million or over principally due to two recent acquisitions of tpi in late december and of acg in february noted below  which contributed an incremental million and million  respectively  and the billing and collection of past service contract fees of million  the costs of which were written off in when acceptance of the billing and collection was deemed to be doubtful 
in addition  we experienced growth in our two significant service operations in the americas segment due to higher volume type services in brazil and an increased installed terminal base in mexico 
the net loss in was principally the result of million increase in our inventory reserves primarily related to non pci compliant products and components and restructuring activities to reconfigure our global sales and marketing organizations  as well as the outsourcing of manufacturing and consolidation of software  repairs and maintenance functions globally 
these activities included the following outsourcing our manufacturing requirements to a third party contract manufacturer  including supply chain  production  assembly  and testing performed in shenzhen  china and in atibaia  brazil 
transitioning of our entire manufacturing operations in shenzhen  china to third party manufacturing partner locations  which commenced in and is expected to be completed in shutdown of manufacturing operations in atibaia  brazil in accordance with our plans to cease negative margin terminal sales 
this activity was completed during the third quarter of  consolidating global software development activities to singapore  latvia  and india  and reducing similar activities now performed in the us and sweden 
the consolidation of global development activities was completed in  relocating us service and repair operations from phoenix  arizona to hermosillo  mexico  which was completed in  and reorganizing and reducing the manufacturing and operations management team in phoenix  arizona consistent with the move to third party contract manufacturing  which commenced in and is expected to continue during as a result of these actions  we incurred charges of million during of which million of cost is in the americas segment  million in the asia pacific segment  million in the emea segment and million in shared cost centers 
these costs are exclusive of any reversals of stock based compensation 
we expect additional costs associated with these and other related activities that will take place during the first and second quarters of to approximate million 
the estimated costs are based on planned activities and circumstances known by us as of the filing of this annual report on form k 
however  due to the inherent risk of the activities being undertaken  we cannot provide assurance that these estimated additional costs will not exceed million 

table of contents in february  we acquired the assets of acg  a provider of installation  technical support and help desk services for point of sale equipment in australia 
the acquisition builds on our existing card payment terminal business in australia and expands our service business footprint in the asia pacific marketplace  providing merchant support for all vendors point of sale terminals in australia as well as a business platform for potential expansion throughout the region 
the purchase price was million in cash  plus the assumption of million in liabilities

the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets has been allocated to separately identifiable intangible assets based upon an independent valuation analysis 
an allocation of approximately million of the purchase price was made to goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and is included in other long term assets

the deposit is recorded in other non current assets 
our cash and short term investments amounted to million as of december  this balance is consistent with the million on hand at december  the cash used to acquire acg and to fund the earnest money deposit were offset by proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters and positive cash flow from operations 
year for  we recorded net income of million per diluted share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million 
products revenue gains were achieved in central and eastern europe  russia and the commonwealth of independent states  middle east and africa  as well as mexico and south america from increased sales of our optimum t product 
we experienced declines 
table of contents in the multi lane sector in north america due to the completion of a significant order in the first half of as well as the effects of transitioning from a direct to indirect sales model for that product line  and we experienced declines in our pacific region due to reduction in product volume at a large customer in australia and a slow down in the new zealand market and emv migration 
our service revenues increased by in to million principally from gains in brazil due to new service contract awards  including servicing competitor products  as well as increased terminal sales  which were put under existing service contracts 
the return to profit in from losses in and resulted from favorable impacts of actions taken after our comprehensive business review see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein the business review  which improved profitability 
these actions resulted in a lower cost structure  a streamlined product line  an increase in revenues from newer bit products and the establishment of a global product marketing group 
as of december   we had million remaining in liabilities associated with the business review compared to million at december  during  million of the million was reversed out through earnings as a result of customers opting out of a particular warranty program and a change in severance benefits paid out 
the remaining liability balance at december  relates to a particular warranty matter in australia of million where we expect to replace certain faulty units in and the balance of an idle facility charge of million expected to be paid out through we also experienced a favorable impact of a gain on the sale of real property in hong kong and had a net positive contribution from interest income less interest expense and foreign exchange losses 
in december  we acquired the assets of tpi  which resulted in a charge of million related to acquired in process research and development 
while this acquisition is expected to contribute significantly toward both our product and services offerings  the contribution in was not material 
our cash and short term investments amounted to million as of december  this balance decreased from december  due to the acquisition of tpi  use of cash in operations  and our purchase of additional treasury shares 
year for  we recorded a net loss of million loss per share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million due to gains in multi lane and processor sales markets in north america as well as in our service businesses  offset by declines associated with the completion of emv rollouts in europe and asia in and the completion of a significant portion of an outsource manufacturing contract in late for one of our larger global customers 
the net loss was most notably impacted by charges resulting from a comprehensive business review and the discontinuance of our uk lease business 
during the latter part of march  a change in senior management was made 
an interim chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer collectively interim management were appointed to replace the former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
the interim chief executive officer  william keiper  was appointed as our chief executive officer and president in august and a new chief financial officer  tom liguori  was appointed in november interim management commenced the business review a comprehensive review of our financial performance  market strategy  products  product development and life cycle management  and employee  customer and vendor relationships

in addition to the business review  we also evaluated our uk lease business during the fourth quarter of and decided to exit this business and sell the existing lease portfolio and related assets  resulting in its classification as a discontinued operation for all periods being presented 
we recognized a million loss on the write down of the uk lease business to its estimated fair value based on purchase offers received from potential buyers 
we continued to maintain our cash reserves  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   compared to million at december   despite funding the cash elements of the business review of million  and purchasing million of treasury stock  and without incurring any indebtedness to fund continuing operations 

table of contents results of continuing operations the following table sets forth the operating results expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated

the increase in product revenue of million was principally the result of gains achieved in emea  as well as the americas with an increase within this segment in mcc  offset by declines in north america 
the increases in product revenue resulted principally from gains in mobile and multi lane products 
the increase in service revenues of million was principally the result of two recent acquisitions  one in north america in late december and one in australia in february  which contributed an incremental million and the billing and collection of past service contract fees of million  the costs of which were written off in when acceptance of the billing and collection was deemed to be doubtful 
in addition we experienced growth in our two significant service operations in the americas segment due to higher volume type services in brazil and an increased installed terminal base in mexico 
cost of revenue and gross profit costs of revenue include the costs of raw materials  manufacturing and service labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  telecommunication cost  inventory valuation provisions  as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases included in continuing operations 

table of contents product gross profit was in compared to in product gross profit was impacted by million in charges related to the restructuring activities and transition costs to contract manufacturing 
the remaining decline in the total gross profit percentage from to resulted principally from changes in product mix in countertop  mobile  and multi lane products resulting in lower gross profit percentages partially offset by increases in volume 
services gross profit was in compared to in services gross profit was impacted by the collection of service contract fees in brazil of million that had no associated costs  as all costs had been written off in due to uncertainties regarding realization 
excluding this collection at margin  the services gross profit was 
gross margin related to services has declined principally due to competitive pressures and changes in service mix in our key service market of brazil 
although management has taken certain actions to address improving gross margins  the impact of pricing and service mix in brazil will likely continue to have a negative impact in our service margins into the foreseeable future 
the services gross margin was also impacted by charges primarily related to a contract loss with a european customer and severances related to cost reductions in brazil 
partially offsetting these charges were the high margin sale of a software license as well as the effect of performing additional services in mexico without a corresponding increase in the cost base 
research and development research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses as a percent of revenue was in compared to in  while overall research and development expenditures have increased million 
the research and development remained consistent from year to year with the primary focus on new product development 
research and development expenses for include severance and other restructuring related charges of million  while includes severance and other termination costs of million 
in december  we acquired the assets of tpi and approximately million related to acquired in process research and development 
this amount was written off at the date of the acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
business combinations accounted for by the purchase method fin as there were no alternative future uses 
management determined the value assigned to this asset through various methods including assistance from a third party valuation firm in valuing the tpi business 
as of the valuation date  there were seven projects that were considered to be in process 
the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the in process projects 
these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating expenses  cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the in process technology 
these net returns were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving commercial readiness 
we believe the assumptions used in valuing in process research and development are reasonable  but are inherently uncertain 
as of december  all of the in process research and development projects associated with the purchase of tpi had been completed 
selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  and facilities operations make up the selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for and for selling  general and administrative expenses of million for include million of merger and acquisition costs  executive severance and collection costs related to the brazil service contract fees  offset by reductions in performance based stock compensation and favorable litigation settlements 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million for  include million in payroll tax charges associated primarily with former employees in china  offset by million in net favorable tax settlements in brazil  reductions in severance related liabilities and accounts receivable allowance recoveries 
selling expenses have decreased principally due to the recognition of the effects of the cost reductions put in place as part of the business review  as well as the restructuring 
during the second quarter of  we completed the sale of our headquarters facilities located in phoenix  arizona  for a sale price of million 
we recorded a gain of million on the sale in the second quarter of we are moving our headquarters to scottsdale  arizona  and have entered into a long term operating lease for our new headquarters facility that will commence in the first half of 
table of contents during the third quarter of  we sold our portion of an office building in hong kong and we recorded a million gain on the sale 
the building was sold as management determined that the cost  size and layout of the facility were not appropriate for the functions performed in that facility 
we have relocated the hong kong operations to other leased space 
interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income in compared to million in this decrease is principally attributable to lower average cash  cash equivalent  and short term investments balances maintained throughout compared to offset partially by increasing yields on our cash investments 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the pay off of mortgage debt in april as well as the non recurrence of interest penalties incurred in on china payroll tax charges 
foreign currency losses totaled million in compared with million in the increase in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to net unfavorable movements of currencies not hedged and a general increase in hedged exposure increasing the direct cost of hedging

the increase in product revenue of million was principally the result of increases in south america  principally brazil  of million  europe and the middle east of million  mcc of million and asian markets of million 
the gains were primarily related to the re entry into markets with our new optimum product line in brazil and mexico as well as the expansion of geographic markets in europe and the middle east 
offsetting most of the increases were declines in multi lane product of million due partially to the completion of large orders in the first half of and also general market conditions  a decline in australia new zealand of million due to a reduction in volume to a significant customer in australia and general softness in the new zealand market 
the increase in service revenues of million was principally the result of increases in our service operations in brazil and mexico  as well as continued growth in our transaction services offering 
service revenues in brazil increased million from to due to additional service contracts added in and an increase in the installed base of terminals resulting from increased sales of terminals 
mexico services increased approximately million from to due to general growth in terminals under service contract and a new service contract 
table of contents entered into with a major customer 
we also experienced an increase in our transaction services revenues of approximately million due to adding new customers to the service as well as a general increase in volumes year over year 
offsetting these increases were declines in chile of million due to a general downsizing of operations in that country  multi lane of million due to less repairs required for the optimum product line  and the us repair laboratory of million 
cost of revenue and gross profit costs of revenue include the costs of raw materials  manufacturing and service labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  telecommunication cost  inventory valuation provisions as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases included in continuing operations 
total gross profit as a percent of revenue increased to in from in total gross profit in was impacted by million in charges related to the business review 
in addition there were approximately million in incremental inventory valuation provisions included in versus excluding these incremental charges  total gross profit as a percent of revenue was for product gross profit was in compared to in  excluding million of charges associated with the business review and million in incremental inventory valuation provisions 
this year over year decrease in product gross margin was principally attributable to a change in the mix of product sales with increases in lower margin geographies such as brazil  as well as higher volumes of optimum terminals that do not have as high a margin as the legacy terminals that have been fully cost reduced and certain declines in selling prices to address strategic market conditions 
additionally  during the second quarter of  product liabilities were reduced by a net million primarily as a result of two customers opting out of the warranty program offered as part of the business review 
however  in the third and fourth quarter of  we recorded charges in the amount of and million  respectively 
these charges related to a payroll tax charge associated with former employees in china and a settlement of a royalty claim associated with patented technologies used in our terminals with signature capture functionality 
there will be a royalty fee charged on our signature capture terminals going forward as well  but it is not expected to significantly impact our gross profit on such terminals 
services gross profit percentage was in and in  excluding million of charges associated with the business review and million in incremental inventory valuation provisions 
this year over year decrease is principally due to additional overhead absorption related to the sale of our uk lease business and changes in the mix of service offerings due to more special service orders at higher margins occurring in versus research and development research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses as a percent of revenue was in compared to in research and development expenses for include severance and other termination costs of million and million in share based compensation  while includes million in incremental charges associated with the business review 
excluding these charges  research and development expenses decreased million from million of revenue in to of revenue million in primarily due to the move of certain us based research and development operations to lower cost off shore locations 
in december  we acquired the assets of tpi 
the acquisition included approximately million related to acquired in process research and development 
this amount was written off at the date of the acquisition  in accordance with fin  as there was no alternative future use 
management determined the value assigned to this asset through various methods including assistance from a third party valuation firm in valuing the tpi business 
as of the valuation date  seven projects were considered to be in process 
the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the in process projects 
these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating expenses  cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the in process technology 
these net returns were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving commercial readiness 
we believe the assumptions used in valuing in process research and development are reasonable  but are inherently uncertain 
since the date of the purchase  we incurred development costs of million related to the acquired in process research and development  and should the projects continue to move 
table of contents toward commercialization  we estimate that future expenditures could approximate million over the next fiscal year 
as of december   all of the in process research and development projects had been completed 
selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  and facilities operations make up the selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for and for selling  general and administrative expenses of million for include million in payroll tax charges associated primarily with former employees in china  an incremental amount of share based compensation of million  offset by million in net favorable tax settlements in brazil  reductions in severance related liabilities and accounts receivable allowance recoveries

in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include a charge of million for legal contingencies for certain tax cases covered under an amnesty program in brazil 
excluding these charges  sg a expenses for totaled million or of revenue 
selling expenses have decreased principally due to the recognition of full effects of the cost reductions put in place as part of the business review 
during the third quarter of  we sold our portion of an office building in hong kong and we recorded a million gain on the sale 
the building was sold as management determined that the cost  size and layout of the facility were not appropriate for the functions performed in that facility 
we have relocated the hong kong operations to other leased space 
interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income in compared to million in this increase is principally attributable to higher average cash  cash equivalent  and short term investments balances maintained throughout compared to and increasing yields on our cash investments 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the write off of debt issuance cost associated with the payoff in april of our floating rate option note payable as well as interest penalties incurred on the china payroll tax charges 
foreign currency loss was million in compared with million in the decrease in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to a relatively stabilized us dollar against our foreign currency exposures throughout as well as improved foreign currency management practices

segment and geographical information during the three months ended march   we began to report information pertaining to three business segments as follows i americas  ii emea  and iii asia pacific 
while we have historically operated globally  in the past the reporting of our global operations did not meet all the criteria as set forth in sfas during the first quarter of  we added a president to the executive management team  initiated certain organizational changes and made enhancements to our internal management reporting  including providing additional reports to our board 
as required in sfas  prior year segment data has been restated for comparative purposes

our services revenues are comprised of asset management services  trusted transaction services and payment solutions  as described in part i to this annual report on form k 
no other type of revenue exceeded of our consolidated net revenues in  or the following table set forth the revenues and operating results by business segment for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  of of of revenue revenue revenue net revenue americas emea asia pacific total net revenue operating income americas emea asia pacific shared cost centers total operating income americas net revenue increased in compared to  principally as a result of increases in mcc and brazil due to countertop and mobile terminal and services revenue  including a collection of million from a past service contract that had been written off in  as well as gains in north america multi lane partially offset by declines in north america countertop and unattended 
emea net revenue increased in compared to principally as a result of increased mobile  countertop and unattended product revenue throughout the region 
asia pacific net revenue increased in compared to principally as a result of the addition of acg  the australian service business acquired in february  which contributed million in americas operating income decreased in compared to principally as a result of increased inventory reserves related to excess non compliant pci inventory together with an allocation of costs associated with our transition to contract manufacturing  and service costs related to the move of our north american repair center to hermosillo  mexico  with the remaining decline related to the decline in north american revenue that typically carries a higher gross margin and the replacement of that revenue with lower gross margin  newer product sales in mexico and brazil 
americas operating profit was also impacted by some larger multi lane deliveries at lower margins 
emea operating profit increased in compared to principally as a result of an increase in revenues with a slight improvement in gross margin due to increased volumes and mix of higher margin products offset by increased inventory reserves for excess network equipment  a warranty settlement  write off of capitalized software  a lost contract with a european customer and an allocation of costs associated with our transition to contract manufacturing 
additionally operating expenses did not increase despite the increase in revenues  improving sales leverage and operating income 

table of contents asia pacific operating income decreased in compared to principally as a result of a decline in revenue in thailand and new zealand year over year that has a higher gross margin  a decline in high gross margin networking equipment revenue  as well as increases in certain direct operating expenses related to increases in sales management and bad debt expenses  partially offset by improvements in gross margin due to the acquisition of acg 
shared cost center expenses decreased in compared to principally as a result of favorable impacts from a gain on sale of real property  litigation settlements and reversal of stock based compensation partially offset by costs incurred for due diligence efforts  as well as executive severance charges 
net revenue for compared to overall were flat at less than growth 
as discussed above  this resulted from gains in brazil  mexico and the emea region  offset by declines in australia new zealand and the multilane business in north america 
operating income in was most notably impacted by the comprehensive business review described above that resulted in expense charges of million 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and occasionally from borrowings under a line of credit and or other debt facilities 
during  our primary source of cash was cash generated by our operations as well as cash received from the sale of real property and to a lesser extent exercise of employee stock options 
we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit during cash flows from continuing operations cash provided by operating activities is net income loss from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled million for compared to cash used in operations of million for  a year over year increase of million 
the increase in cash provided by operations is principally related to changes in operating assets and liabilities offset partially by the net loss 
changes in operating assets and liabilities and the related impact on our operating cash flows consist of the following change accounts receivable inventories accounts payable other increase decrease in operating assets and liabilities cash used to finance our accounts receivable increased as a result of an increase in days sales outstanding due to extended payment terms for certain high credit rated customers as well as increases in deferred revenue principally for sales transactions not meeting all revenue recognition criteria at time of shipment  which was offset partially by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses as part of our cash management activities 
cash has also been significantly impacted due to decreases in inventory levels primarily resulting from the transition to contract manufacturing 
other changes represent increases in accrued payroll and related expenses  accrued liabilities primarily from professional services and deferred revenues 
cash flows from investing activities investing cash flows consist principally of capital expenditures and the net changes in cash associated with our investment of excess cash generated by operations or proceeds from liquidations of investments to fund operations  acquire capital assets or businesses 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to million in 
table of contents cash provided by investing activities for consisted principally of proceeds from the sale of real property of million plus net proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million as we moved to more liquid cash investments due to the pending acquisition of tet  offset by the acquisition of acg for million  purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  and capitalized software costs of million 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in and million in during and  capital expenditures were principally for upgrades to computer software and hardware and equipment purchases 
we intend to spend approximately to million over the next twelve months for capital expenditures related to outfitting the new corporate headquarters exclusive of lessor build out concessions  computer hardware and software upgrades  and strategic software implementations surrounding customer  product and service management 
cash flows from financing activities financing cash flows consist principally of the issuance of common stock due to the exercise of employee stock options  repayment of long term debt  and the purchase of treasury stock 
during  cash provided by financing activities was million compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the primary reasons for the increase in cash from financing activities of million were the early pay off of our debt associated with our headquarters and decreased purchases of treasury stock in offset by fewer proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in cash flows from discontinued operations see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included herein cash flows from discontinued operations principally relates to our fourth quarter discontinuance of our uk lease business and our direct finance lease operation sold in the third quarter of cash flows from operations consist principally of net cash earnings from the uk lease business 
the decrease in operating cash flows provided by discontinued operations of million in over is the result of the sale of the uk lease business during the second quarter of cash flows generated by investing activities for of million relate to net proceeds from the sale of the uk lease business 
the cash flows from discontinued operations in were not significant to our change in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations will not cause us to be unable to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements due to our cash reserves and short term investments together with the ability to control certain cash outlays  such as the purchase of treasury stock 
should operating results from continuing operations prove unfavorable  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
projected liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million and million  respectively 
we have moved short term investments into more liquid cash and cash equivalent investment arrangements in anticipation of funding approximately million as a portion of the million purchase price of tet 
the remaining million is expected to be funded through a senior credit facility previously entered into  the funds of which will be disbursed simultaneously with the closing of the purchase of tet 
the senior credit facility includes a five year warrant for the lender to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at per share 
the warrant will be issued at the time of funding and contains a cashless exercise provision 
in addition  on january   we entered into a loan agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million with a possibility to borrow up to million if certain conditions are met 
available borrowings under the loan agreement are subject to borrowing base calculations based on the value of eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the loan agreement includes customary covenants and certain negative 
table of contents covenants prohibiting the occurrence of certain types of debt  limiting capital expenditures or disposing of assets 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by the inventory and accounts receivable of certain of our subsidiaries in the us and the us the remaining balance of our consolidated assets are unencumbered under the loan agreement and  if needed  may be used as collateral for additional debt 
this loan agreement was put in place in anticipation of the purchase of tet  as well as for operational purposes 
we believe that our cash reserves and short term investments combined with our loan agreement and our ability to influence operating cash flows as well as certain investing and financing cash outlays  will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements through should operating results prove unfavorable  we may need to obtain additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
if we close the purchase of tet  we believe that these cash reserves and short term investments combined with our loan agreement  the anticipated senior credit facility and our ability to influence operating cash flows  as well as certain investing and financing cash outlays  will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements  including the acquisition of tet  through contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods dollars in thousands 
less than after total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases minimum purchase obligations total excludes payments under our senior credit facility with francisco partners and revolving credit facility with a bank  as no borrowings have taken place yet under either credit facility 
all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility are due four years from the funding date  which is expected to occur by march  all amounts outstanding  if any  under the revolving credit facility are due on january  minimum purchase obligations include all outstanding obligations to purchase goods or services at december  including agreements that are cancelable without penalty and agreements  which are enforceable and legally binding 
we estimate that approximately of the outstanding purchase obligations at december  are non cancelable due to the customized nature of the order and the long lead time requirements 
debt amendments on march   we entered into a line of credit agreement with a bank pursuant to which we had access to a million line of credit 
borrowings under the credit agreement were fully collateralized by short term investments held in our investment accounts with the bank 
any borrowings bore interest at a rate set forth in each promissory note issued at the time of the advance 
the credit agreement contained customary default provisions and was set to expire on march   but was extended to march  stock repurchase during august  the board authorized a stock repurchase program to allow the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
during november  the board authorized a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to an additional million of our common stock 
during march  we announced the adoption of a rule b plan for the repurchase of up to million of common stock pursuant to the terms of an existing repurchase authorization 

table of contents during and  we purchased  and  shares of our common stock for and million  respectively 
there were no treasury stock repurchases during the repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock and resulted in a reduction to stockholder s equity 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of under the share repurchase programs 
the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate considerations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k and fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised 
outlook in  we intend to continue our focus on initiatives to drive profitability and expand the business to achieve added scale 
key initiatives include completion of the acquisition and integration of tet  market share growth in strategically targeted geographies and improving gross margins with cost reductions and value added selling 
a well experienced senior management team is in place globally to specifically address and manage these key initiatives  and efforts are ongoing to recruit additional managers as part of our restructuring  as well as retaining seasoned management from thales as part of the tet acquisition 
we will continue to leverage our existing cost structure on anticipated higher revenues in we will continue to see competitive pressures on a global basis as we and our major competitors try to expand our respective market share 
these pressures will generally serve to decrease average selling prices for certain products within certain geographies 
we intend to continue to offset declines in selling prices with increases in volumes together with further cost reductions in our products  as well as continuing to differentiate our product and total electronic payment solution offerings from our competitors 
we will continue to manage our balance sheet and leverage our working capital in instances where it can help meet the objectives of our key initiatives for impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no

earn outs and other forms of contingent consideration are to be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date 
changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the cost of the acquisition 
sfas r generally applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  with early adoption prohibited

in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is generally effective for years beginning after december  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
if elected  sfas is effective beginning january  under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure eligible items at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
eligible items include  but are not limited to  accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees  issued debt and firm commitments 
we elected not to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value as of january  in accordance with sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our cash equivalent investments are primarily in money market accounts and certificates of deposit and are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days from date of purchase 
our interest rate risk with respect to existing investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned  which approximate current interest rates for similar investments 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material given that our discount notes have fixed rates 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a substantial portion of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do at times enter into transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound and other asian and european currencies 
as a policy  we hedge the translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to neutralize the effect of translation gains or losses in the statement of operations 
financial hedging instruments are limited by our policy to foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
we enter into forward or option contracts with our bank or other financial institutions to accomplish our hedging strategy 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real  thai baht  mexican peso and australian dollar  with smaller contracts for the british pound and chilean peso 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consist of mark to market adjustments  which are recorded in earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 
we do not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage 
see item a  risk factors international operations pose additional challenges and risks that if not properly managed could adversely affect our financial results elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
at present  we have no material long term debt obligations and there are no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  however  we anticipate borrowings in the near future under both our senior credit facility and revolving credit facility see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
as such  our interest rate risk is not significant with respect to existing debt 

table of contents during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
