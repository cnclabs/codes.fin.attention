item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  sales and operating results for the installation and other services segment are significantly affected by the level of new home construction activity 
in addition to price  the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service  range of products and services offered  and quality of installation service 
the company believes it is the largest national provider of installed insulation in the united states 
competitors include several regional contractors  as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards 
the company buys insulation from a limited number of large suppliers in the united states market 
historically  during periods of rapid growth in the new home construction market  the industry has encountered shortages of insulation  leading to price volatility and allocations of supply 
as one of the country s largest purchasers of insulation  the company has been able to successfully meet its needs in the past  although the volatility of material costs does impact our financial performance 

table of contents the installation and other services segment is a labor intensive business 
significant changes in federal  state and local regulations addressing immigration and wages  as well as collective bargaining arrangements affecting wages and working conditions  could adversely affect the financial performance of the company s business 
decorative architectural products the company manufactures architectural coatings including paints  specialty paint products  stains  varnishes and waterproofing products 
the products are sold in the united states and canada under the brand names behr  kilz and expressions to the do it yourself and professional markets through home centers  paint stores and other retailers

the kilz brand is sold in north america through home center retailers and discount retailers  and through hardware stores  paint stores and dealers 
net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately percent  percent and percent of the company s consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore  glidden  olympic  sherwin williams  valspar and zinsser  as well as many regional and other national brands 
in addition to price  the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality  technology and product innovation  customer service and brand reputation 
the behr brand is sold through the home depot  the segment s and the company s largest customer 
the paint departments at the home depot stores include the behr color center and computer kiosk with the color smart by behr computerized color matching system that enables consumers to select and coordinate their paint color selection 
the loss of the home depot as a customer would significantly impact the segment s business and that of the company as a whole 
titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint 
shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand and from disruption of refining capacity ie  hurricane katrina in the fall of 
similar events in the future could adversely impact the financial performance of the company s business 
petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings 
significant increases in the cost of crude oil lead to higher raw material costs ie  for resins  solvents  packaging  which can adversely affect the segment s results of operations 
the decorative architectural products segment also includes liberty door  window and other hardware  which is manufactured for the company and sold to home centers  other retailers  original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets 
key competitors in north america include amerock  belwith  umbra and stanley 
decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names franklin brass and decor bathware to distributors  home center retailers and other retailers 
competitors include moen and globe union 
other specialty products the company manufactures and sells vinyl  fiberglass and aluminum windows and doors under the milgard windows brand name to the new home construction and home improvement markets  principally in the western united states 
milgard windows products are sold primarily through dealers and  to a lesser extent  direct to production homebuilders and through lumberyards and home center retailers

sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the repair and remodeling markets 
united kingdom competitors include many small and mid sized firms and a few large  vertically integrated competitors 
in addition to price  the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and product quality 

table of contents the company manufactures and sells a complete line of manual and electric staple gun tackers  staples and other fastening tools under the brand names arrow and powershot 
these products are sold through various distribution channels including home center and other retailers and wholesalers 
the principal north american competitor in this product line is stanley 
the company also manufactures residential hydronic radiators and heat convectors under the brand names brugman  superia tm  thermic tm and vasco  which are sold to the european wholesale market and to retail home centers from operations in belgium  the netherlands and poland 
additional information the company holds united states and foreign patents  patent applications  licenses  trademarks and trade names 
as a manufacturer and distributor of brand name products  we view our trademarks and other proprietary rights as important  but do not believe that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our present business as a whole 
all of the company s operating segments  except the plumbing products segment  normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters  corresponding with the peak season for new home construction and remodeling 
compliance with federal  state and local regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  is not expected to result in material capital expenditures by the company or to have a material adverse effect on the company s earning or competitive position

risk factors 
there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect our company 
these risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results  including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of the impact on our company of certain of these risk factors is discussed below under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently believe to be immaterial  also may adversely impact our company 
should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following  which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 

table of contents a significant portion of our business relies on residential construction activity and general economic conditions 
a significant part of our business is affected by levels of home improvement including repair and remodeling and new home construction activity  principally in north america and europe 
demographic factors  such as changes in population growth and household formations  affect levels of home improvement and new home construction over the long term 
significant factors that impact demand for home improvement and new home construction in the short term include the inventory levels of unsold new and existing homes  general and regional economic conditions  consumer confidence and credit  terms and availability of financing  affordability of homes  interest rates  energy costs  and  on a more localized basis  weather conditions and natural disasters 
the new home construction market  in particular  is cyclical in nature 
a discussion of the impact of the decline in new home construction and in consumer spending for home improvement items on our various segments and on the company s operating results is located under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under item of this report 
we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 
the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated 
larger customers can effect significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which we do business 
further  during downturns in our markets  declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of significant customers may impact the volume of our business  the credit risk involved and our terms of doing business with them 
sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial 
in  sales to the company s largest customer  the home depot  were billion approximately percent of the company s consolidated net sales 
although builders  dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the company s products and services  the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot would have a material adverse impact on the company 
as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers  conflicts occur and in some instances we may also become their competitor 
increasingly  we are transacting business directly with our larger customers 
these arrangements may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale means 
in addition  our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity  which may impact our product offerings to other customers 
our principal markets are becoming more competitive 
the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive and  in recent years  competition has intensified significantly 
competition is further exacerbated during economic downturns 
home center retailers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers  particularly low cost suppliers in asia  for sale as private label and house brand merchandise 
also  home center retailers  which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers  are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and installers 
the company believes that competition in our industries is based largely on price  product and service quality  brand reputation  customer service and product features 
although the relative importance of such factors varies among customers and product categories  price is often a primary factor 
although we view the long term demographic trends for our markets as generally favorable  our markets are mature  cyclical and growing slowly 
additionally  our market position in and the competitive composition of our traditional markets affect our ability to expand our market share 
in recent years  we have directed our strategic focus to organic growth and on developing new products and 
table of contents expanding our services  rather than on growth through acquisitions 
however  our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses is challenged since it depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers  implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets  capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names  managing our cost structure  accommodating shorter life cycles for our products and identifying and effectively responding to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns through product development and innovation 
the importance of sophisticated information technology to our industry is increasing 
in order to remain competitive and respond to customer requirements and changes in their business processes  such as inventory replenishment  merchandise ordering  transportation and payment processing  the company must be able to identify and implement comprehensive enterprise resource planning erp systems 
erp systems are also critical to our supply chain management and logistics capabilities 
the successful implementation of erp systems also requires significant investment by the company of both time and capital 
difficulties encountered in the deployment of significant new systems and other technology could be disruptive to the operation of our businesses 
the cost and availability of materials and labor and the performance of our supply chain affect our operating results 
when we incur cost increases for commodities or materials that are major components of our products or services  such as brass  insulation or titanium dioxide  it can be difficult for us to offset the impact on our operating results on a timely basis 
delays in adjusting or inability to adjust prices may be due to such factors as our existing arrangements with customers  competitive considerations  or customer resistance to such price increases 
when the number of available sources for raw materials is limited  price volatility is more likely to occur and with longer duration when demand exceeds supply 
in addition to their impact on our production expenses  increased costs of energy and other commodities  such as crude oil  can significantly affect the cost to transport our products and adversely affect our results of operations 
see installation and other services for a discussion of the impact of cost of raw materials and availability of labor and materials on that segment of our business 
we may also be adversely affected if our homebuilder customers encounter difficulty or delays in obtaining required materials from their other suppliers or if they encounter labor shortages 
this is particularly likely to occur during periods of rapid growth in the new home construction market 
under such circumstances  homebuilders may delay their construction schedules and  as a result  may reduce or delay their purchase of products and services from us 
we rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain of our products or key components 
if there is an interruption in these sources of supply  we may experience difficulty or delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be disrupted 
international political  economic and social developments impact our business 
over percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds 
our international business faces risks associated with changes in political  monetary  economic and social environments  local labor conditions and practices  the laws  regulations and policies of foreign governments  cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 
the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 
us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad  including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices  also impact our international business 
our international operating results may be influenced  when compared to our north american results  in part due to relative economic conditions in the european markets and due to competitive pricing pressures on certain products 

table of contents increasingly  we are manufacturing in asia and sourcing products and components from third parties in asia 
the distances involved in these arrangements  together with differences in business practices  shipping and delivery requirements  the limited number of suppliers  and laws and regulations  have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain  the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 
we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets  including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 
we have maintained investments in available for sale securities including marketable and auction rate securities and a number of private equity funds 
since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation 
in addition  we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 
product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 
increasingly  homebuilders  including our customers  are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business 
our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install 
these claims frequently result in lawsuits against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors  including the company  and require defense costs even when such products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 
we are also subject to product safety regulations  recalls and direct claims for product liability  including putative class actions 
product liability claims can result in significant liability and  regardless of the ultimate outcome  can be costly to defend 
also  we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell 
because of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers  we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 
the company has experienced an increase in the number of putative class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations  product liability  wage and hour issues and other matters 
the company has generally denied liability and vigorously defends these cases 
however  even when there is no basis for imposing liability on the company  such lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve due to their scope  complexity and the potentially significant exposure that is alleged 
see note t to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 
government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 
government and other regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees as well as consumers and environmental concerns continue to emerge  domestically as well as internationally 
in addition to having to comply with current requirements including requirements that do not become effective until a future date  even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future 
compliance with these regulations such as the restrictions on lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our businesses  may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing 
such actions could adversely impact our operating results  and our ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position 

table of contents the long term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract  develop and retain talented management 
to be successful  we must attract  develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel in management  sales  marketing  research and development and  as we enter new international markets  skilled personnel familiar with these markets 
we compete with multinational firms in manufacturing and other industries for these employees and we invest significant resources in recruiting  developing and motivating them 
the failure to attract  motivate  develop and retain key managers and other key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the company s views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors of this report  the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect the company s performance 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview the company manufactures  distributes and installs home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  builders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of new home construction and home improvement activity principally in north america and europe  the importance of and the company s relationships with key customers including the home depot  which represented approximately percent of the company s net sales in  the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its us and global markets in the face of increasing competition  the company s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure  and the cost and availability of labor and materials 
the company s international business faces political  monetary  economic and other risks that vary from country to country  as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
further  the company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk 
in addition  product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 
these and other factors are discussed in more detail in item a risk factors of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience  as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition and receivables the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered 
the company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment  such amounts are recorded in receivables 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
financial investments the company has maintained investments in available for sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million and million  respectively  at december  investments in available for sale and marketable securities are recorded at fair value  and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized  net of tax  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
during  the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges of million related to its investment in furniture brands international common stock and million related to its investment in asahi tec common stock 
from time to time  the company invests its excess cash in short term financial instruments including auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every  or days 
during the third quarter of  the company revised the classification of investments in auction rate securities from cash and cash investments to available for sale securities included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company has also made corresponding adjustments to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended december   and  to reflect the gross cash purchases and sales of these securities in cash flows for from investing activities 
these changes in classification do not affect previously reported consolidated statements of income or cash flows from operating activities in any prior period 
during  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million related to auction rate securities 
on january   the acquisition of metaldyne corporation metaldyne formerly mascotech  inc by asahi tec corporation asahi tec  a japanese automotive supplier  was finalized 
the combined fair value of the asahi tec common and preferred stock  as well as the derivative related to the conversion feature on the preferred stock  received in exchange for the company s investment in metaldyne  was million 
as a result of the transaction  the company recognized a gain of million  net of transaction fees  included in the company s consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   in income from other investments  net 
subsequent to the transaction  the company s investment in asahi tec common and preferred stock is accounted for as available for sale and unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value of the asahi tec common and preferred stock at december  have been recognized  net of tax  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the unrealized loss of million related to the change in fair value of the derivative 
table of contents related to the conversion feature on the preferred stock  has been included in income from other investments  net 
in addition  immediately prior to its sale  metaldyne distributed shares of trimas corporation trimas common stock as a dividend to the holders of metaldyne common stock  the company recognized income of million included in the company s consolidated statement of income  in dividend income from other investments 
in may  trimas made an initial public offering  subsequent to the offering  the company s investment in trimas is accounted for as available for sale and unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value of the investment have been recognized  net of tax  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for potential impairment when impairment indicators are present  or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred  that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
impairment indicators the company considers include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance  asset quality or business prospects  a significant adverse change in the regulatory  economic or technological environment  a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates  and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value 
since there is no active trading market for these investments  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
during  the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges of million related to certain of its investments in private equity funds 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the fourth quarter of each year  or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying amount  the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  the company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
the company generally develops these forecasts based upon  among other things  recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting business units were greater than the carrying values 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit  including any 
table of contents previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting business unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
in  the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of million million  after tax 
the pre tax impairment charges recorded in were as follows plumbing products segment million related to a north american manufacturer of plumbing related products  and other specialty products segment million related to a european manufacturer of heating products 
the company reviews its other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit 
the company considers the implications of both external eg  market growth  competition and local economic conditions and internal eg  product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term 
in  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge for other indefinite lived intangible assets of million million  after tax in the other specialty products segment related to the value of a registered trademark

pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the company s consolidated financial statements in any given period 
in  the company increased its discount rate for obligations to an average of percent from percent 
the discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plan s liabilities matched to the december  citigroup pension discount curve 
such rates for the company s defined benefit pension plans ranged from percent to percent  with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of percent or higher 
the assumed asset return was primarily percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
the company s net underfunded amount for its qualified defined benefit pension plans  the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets  decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to asset returns and funding 
table of contents contributions  in accordance with sfas no

historically  the company established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  sfas no 

under this standard  reserves for tax contingencies were established when it was probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin no 

fin no 
allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
the adoption of fin no 
was effective january  fin no 
establishes a lower threshold than sfas no 
for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions referred to by fin no 
as unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  the company believes that there is a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with sfas no 
while the company believes it has adequately provided for its uncertain tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
accordingly  additional provisions for tax related matters  including interest and penalties  could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved

the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
the interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges  and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement
