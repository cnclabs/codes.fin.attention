executive level overview a majority of our revenues are driven by marketing and advertising spending by consumer product companies and retailers 
the markets served are consumer product manufacturers and pharmaceutical  entertainment  retail and publishing companies 
our business involves producing graphic images for various applications 
generally  a graphic image is created by us or a third party and then the company manipulates that image to enhance the color of the image and to prepare it for print 
the applications vary from consumer product packaging  including food and beverage packaging images  to retail advertisements in newspapers  including free standing inserts fsi s and magazine ads 
the graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application 
the following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final tangible design image planning and messaging strategic design content creation file building retouching art production pre media 
table of contents the company s involvement in a client project may involve many of the above steps or just one of the steps  depending on the client s needs 
each client assignment  or job  is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique  even if it only involves a small change from an existing image  such as adding a low fat banner on a food package 
essentially  change equals revenue 
the company is paid for our graphic imaging production work regardless of the success or failure of the food product  the promotion or the ad campaign 
historically  a substantial majority of our revenues have been derived from providing graphic design services for consumer product packaging applications 
packaging changes and new product introductions occur with such frequency and lack of notice  and customer turn around requirements are so tight  that there is little backlog 
there are regular promotions throughout the year that create revenue opportunities for us  for example valentine s day  easter  fourth of july  back to school  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  there are event driven promotions that occur regularly  such as the super bowl  grammy awards  world series  indianapolis and the olympics 
lastly  there are a number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging  such as heart healthy  low in carbohydrates  enriched with essential vitamins  low in saturated fat and caffeine free 
all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs  in each case creating additional opportunities for revenue 
graphic design services for the consumer products packaging industry generally involve higher margins due to the substantial expertise necessary to meet consumer products companies precise specifications and to quickly  consistently and efficiently bring their products to market  as well as due to the complexity and variety of packaging materials  shapes and sizes  custom colors and storage conditions 
as a result of the acquisition of seven in january described below  the company has increased the percentage of our revenue derived from providing graphic design services to our advertising and retail clients and added to our service offering graphic design services to the entertainment market 
these clients typically require high volume  commodity oriented prepress graphic services 
graphic design services for these clients typically yield relatively lower margins due to the lower degree of complexity in providing such services  and the number and size of companies in the industry capable of providing such services 
as discussed more fully below under acquisitions and results of operations  the altered mix of services following our acquisitions of winnetts and seven has impacted our results of operations beginning in and will continue to impact our results of operations in the future 
the company continues to review its operations to identify potential dispositions of assets that fail to meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
the company s operations are managed primarily by geographic area and are grouped for segment reporting purposes into two segments north america europe and all other segments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company s ten largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in and of our revenues in in both and approximately of our total revenues came from our largest single client 
while the company seeks to build long term client relationships  revenues from any particular client can fluctuate from period to period due to such client s purchasing patterns 
any termination of or significant reduction in our business relationship with any of our principal clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition as disclosed in the company s form q for the quarter ended september   the company determined that it had a deficiency in internal control over revenue recognition 
in the fourth quarter  the company put processes in place to improve its compliance with the revenue recognition requirements under the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab however as of december  the company was not able to establish an effective control over revenue recognition 
specifically  we failed to design effective controls to ensure that all criteria of revenue recognition were met prior to invoicing 
we also failed to design an effective control over the process to accurately record amounts related to earned but unbilled revenue at period end 
in addition  in conjunction with management s efforts to appropriately recognize software and services revenue  management identified material weaknesses in the internal controls over software revenue recognition 
specifically  the company had multiple element arrangements subject to aicpa statement of position software revenue recognition  statement of position software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and emerging issues task force no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables for which it had not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for certain undelivered elements 
the company improperly allocated revenues to various elements and as a result had improperly recorded revenue for certain delivered elements 
accounting for capitalized software costs software developed for sale to third parties

accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed in that the company was capitalizing costs before technological feasibility was reached 
software developed for internal use 
management also concluded that the company had a material weakness in internal controls related to the accounting for costs pertaining to internal use software

the company had inadequate supervision and review of those responsible for recording income tax related journal entries which resulted in an inability to properly reconcile current tax payable and gross deferred tax liabilities to the general ledger on a timely basis 
this weakness resulted in significant revisions being made to the company s income tax accounts prior to finalization of the tax accounts as reported in its december  consolidated financial statements 

table of contents entity level controls due to the nature and number of material weaknesses identified above  as well as the necessity to restate prior period financial statements  we concluded that our entity level controls were not effective in the areas of control environment  risk assessment and control activities eg journal entries 
in particular  in certain areas  the level of accounting knowledge  experience and training was not sufficient to properly control the accounting for revenue including software revenue and costs  software development costs capitalization  income tax accounting and a more appropriate tone with respect to the importance of accounting and control awareness needed to be established 
as a result of the identified material weaknesses  management concluded that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective

this is an initial step to be followed up with a thorough review and evaluation of the process around revenue recognition with the objective being the design of effective controls to make sure the criteria for revenue recognition have been met prior to invoicing or recognizing unbilled revenue 
after these controls over revenue recognition have been designed and implemented  we will conduct formal revenue recognition training sessions for key accounting and operating personnel

with respect to software developed for internal use  in the fourth quarter of we instituted a more comprehensive timekeeping system to better document and monitor activities of both internal personnel and external contractors that work on software for internal use 
our plan to remediate this weakness will include developing controls to ensure that project plans clearly delineate activities relating to planning  application development and post implementation support and that minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred and educating employees with respect to the requirements of aicpa statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates are limited to those described below 
accounts receivable 
our clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  advertising agencies  retailers  both grocery and non grocery and entertainment companies 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
in assessing the carrying value of its accounts receivable  the company estimated the recoverability by making assumptions based on our historical write off experience and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos of  was established at december   compared to an allowance of  at december  a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
a to increase in the company s write off experience would 
table of contents result in an approximate to increase in bad debt expense for a given period  based upon the company s methodology for calculating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  the company s estimates have not been materially different than actual results 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the consumer packaging industry  a loss of a major customer or several customers  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is used or an adverse change in the physical condition of an asset 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment  and therefore the company did not recognize any material impairment charges in a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which may subsequently result in an impairment charge 
the company recorded an impairment charge in of approximately  related primarily to write down the value of a building sold during the year and the write down of certain leasehold improvements 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill  customer relationships and  to a lesser extent  other intangible assets 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
events that may indicate potential impairment include a loss of or a significant decrease in volume from a major customer  a change in the expected useful life of an asset  a change in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  unanticipated competition relative to a major customer or the loss of key personnel relative to a major customer 
when a potential impairment condition has been identified  an impairment test of the intangible asset is performed  based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment write down of  primarily for a customer relationship intangible asset for which it was determined that future estimated cash flows did not support the carrying value 
this is the first year that the company recorded a material impairment of acquired intangible assets 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  additional impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company did not identify any other events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an impairment condition existed at december  we perform the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or more frequently if conditions warrant 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the reporting units of the company  after considering the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as amended and the relevant provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  and related interpretive literature are defined primarily on a geographic basis 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business acquired 
the impairment test performed by the company is based on an estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
this fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow of earnings model 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  and or a significant decrease in the market value of the company s common stock could result in an impairment charge 
the company determined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in  and a decrease in the fair value estimates used in the impairment test would not have changed this determination 
the company has never recorded a material impairment of goodwill 

table of contents income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized 
federal  state and foreign tax authorities regularly audit us  like other multi national companies  and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as amended an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin no 
contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
actual outcomes could result in a change in reported income tax expense for a particular period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company has provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  primarily arising from the acquisition of seven in  due to the dormancy of the companies generating the tax assets or due to income tax rules limiting the availability of the losses to offset future taxable income 
exit reserves 
the company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies 
the exit plans are approved by company management prior to  or shortly after  the acquisition date 
the exit plans provide for severance pay  lease abandonment costs and other related expenses 
a change in any of the assumptions used to estimate the exit reserves that result in a decrease to the reserve would result in a decrease to goodwill 
any change in assumptions that result in an increase to the exit reserves would result in a charge to income 
during  the company recorded a reduction to its exit reserves for the seven worldwide acquisition in the amount of  primarily due to the signing of a new sublease agreement at one of its uk facilities  which changed the assumptions of future costs for the vacated facility 
at december   the company had exit reserves of approximately  that were included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  for exit activities completed in through  primarily for facility closure costs 
future increases or decreases in these reserves are possible  as the company continues to assess changes in circumstance that would alter the future cost assumptions used in the calculation of the reserves 
however  the company believes that  because the current exit reserves are diminishing  any further changes to the exit reserves would be immaterial to its consolidated financial statements

r expands on the disclosures previously required by sfas no 
 better defines the acquirer and the acquisition date in a business combination  and establishes principles for recognizing and measuring the assets acquired including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interests in the acquired business 
sfas r changes the accounting for acquisition related costs from being included as part of the purchase price of a business acquired to being expensed as incurred and will require the acquiring company to recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally to be reflected in earnings  as opposed to additional purchase price of the acquired business 
as the company has a history of growing its business through acquisitions  the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on its results of operations in future periods  which impact depends on the size and the number of acquisitions it consummates in the future 
sfas no
