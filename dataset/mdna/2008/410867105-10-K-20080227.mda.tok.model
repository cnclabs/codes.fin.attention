executive overview our property and casualty business constitutes our primary ongoing operations and includes our personal lines segment  our commercial lines segment and our other property and casualty segment 
personal lines in our personal lines business  we are focused on making investments that are intended to help us maintain profitability  build a distinctive position in the market and provide us with profitable growth opportunities 
we expect premium growth from connections auto  which is available in seventeen states and is expected to be available in massachusetts in as a result of massachusetts implementation of managed competition 
connections auto accounts for most of our new personal automobile business 
our connections auto product is designed to be competitive for a wide spectrum of drivers through its multivariate rating application  which calculates rates based upon the magnitude and correlation of multiple risk factors 
additionally  we remain focused on expanding our distribution capabilities through agency appointments  particularly in states where we have historically done little or no business 
we appointed over new agents in and continue to focus on the development of these and additional new relationships with agents in the states where we conduct business 
at the same time  core to our strategy is to broaden our portfolio offerings and write total accounts  which are accounts that include multiple personal line coverages for the same customer 
accordingly  in  we introduced a new homeowners product  connections home  which is intended to improve our competitiveness and to attract more total account business and is available in sixteen states 
additionally  we continue to make investments in and focus on growing our umbrella product and other personal lines coverages 
having implemented a broader portfolio of products that has begun contributing to our growth  we continue to work closely with high potential agents to increase the percentage of business they place with us and to ensure this business is consistent with our preferred mix of business 
we expect these efforts to contribute to growth and improved retention in our personal lines segment 
current market conditions  however  continue to be challenging with pricing pressures and economic conditions becoming more difficult  especially in michigan  and may impact our ability to grow and retain business 
we are working closely with our partner agents in michigan to remain a dominant writer with strong margins 
we believe that market conditions will remain challenging and competitive in personal lines in commercial lines in the commercial lines business  the market continues to be increasingly competitive  a trend that we expect to continue and intensify for the foreseeable future 
more significant price competition requires us to continue to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we grow the business only at acceptable margins 
we continue to target  through mid sized agents  small and first tier middle markets  which encompass clients whose premiums are generally below  we plan to continue to develop our specialty businesses  particularly bond and inland marine  which on average are expected to offer higher margins over time and enable us to deliver a more complete product portfolio to our agents and policyholders in our target markets 
during  we experienced significant new business growth in our specialty lines and anticipate further growth in these lines in the future 
we continue to focus on expanding our product offerings in specialty businesses as evidenced through our acquisition of professionals direct  inc  which provides professional liability coverage for lawyers  and our recently announced intention to purchase 
table of contents verlan holdings  inc  a specialty company providing property insurance to small and medium sized manufacturing and distribution companies that are highly protected fire risks 
we believe these acquisitions provide us with better breadth and diversification of products and improve our competitive position with our agents 
additionally  we have enhanced the products and operational effectiveness of our small commercial business platform during these improvements included expanded underwriting appetite for small account  low hazard workers compensation and business owners policies  as well as additional coverage features in our business owners policies 
our technology investments are intended to provide our agents with the ability to view a customer s full account and provide eligibility guidance  as well as other important ease of business improvements 
our focus continues to be on improving and expanding our partnerships with agents 
we believe our specialty capabilities and small commercial opportunities  coupled with distinctiveness in the middle market  enables us to deliver significant value to our agents and policyholders in our target markets 
results during  our property and casualty group s segment income increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase was attributable to lower losses  including a million decrease in catastrophe related activity  primarily due to lower unfavorable development on prior years hurricane katrina reserves in compared to also reflected in the lower losses for was higher favorable development of prior years reserves  partially offset by increased current accident year losses 
additionally  net investment income was million higher than the comparable period of we experienced new business premium growth in commercial lines during  primarily in our bond and inland marine businesses 
this growth  however  was tempered by increased pricing competition in our core lines of business 
in personal lines  our actions to reduce coastal exposures and a mandated decrease in massachusetts personal automobile rates significantly reduced premium growth in additionally  over the past several years  we have made significant investments and incurred increased expenses in order to  among other things  strengthen our product offerings and service capabilities  improve technology and our operating models  build expertise in our personnel and expand our distribution capabilities 
our ability to achieve significant profitable premium growth in and later years  in order to earn adequate returns on such investments and expenses  and to grow further without proportionate increases in expenses  is key to our current strategy 
description of operating segments our primary business operations include insurance products and services in three property and casualty operating segments 
these segments are personal lines  commercial lines and other property and casualty 
our fourth operating segment  life companies  is in run off 
we present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the property and casualty group manages its operations principally through three segments personal lines  commercial lines and other property and casualty 
personal lines includes personal automobile  homeowners and other personal coverages  while commercial lines includes commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile  workers compensation and other commercial coverages  such as bonds and inland marine business 
in addition  the other property and casualty segment consists of opus investment management  inc opus  which markets investment management services to institutions  pension funds and other organizations  amgro  inc amgro  our premium financing business  and earnings on holding company assets  as well as voluntary pools business in which we have not actively participated since our life companies segment  which is in runoff  consists primarily of a block of traditional life insurance products principally the closed block  a block of group retirement annuity contracts and two remaining guaranteed investment contracts gics 
assets and liabilities related to our reinsured variable life insurance and annuity business  as well as our discontinued group life and health business  including group life and health voluntary pools  are reflected in this segment 
we report interest expense related to our corporate debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments 
corporate debt consists of our junior subordinated debentures and our senior debentures 

table of contents results of operations our consolidated net income includes the results of our four operating segments segment income  which we evaluate on a pre tax basis  and our interest expense on corporate debt 
in addition  segment income excludes certain items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations 
the income of our segments excludes items such as federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses  including net gains or losses on certain derivative instruments  because fluctuations in these gains and losses are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  restructuring costs  extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items 
although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance  we believe segment income enhances an investor s understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income attributable to the core operations of the business 
however  segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
catastrophe losses are a significant component in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our property and casualty insurance business 
however  catastrophic events  such as hurricane katrina  make it difficult to assess the underlying trends in this business 
management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to million in the million increase in earnings primarily reflects increased after tax segment results of million  primarily in our property and casualty business  and the absence of million of losses incurred in related to the prior disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business 
the increase in property and casualty segment results primarily reflects a decrease in catastrophe related activity  as well as higher net investment income 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to a net loss of million in the increase in of million is primarily the result of the absence  in  of the million loss on the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business recorded in  as well as an increase in segment results from our property and casualty business 
this improvement in property and casualty segment results primarily reflects lower after tax catastrophe losses in we experienced unusually high catastrophe losses in from hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita

in addition  segment income was positively affected by litigation settlements of million and million for and  respectively 
excluding the impact of all catastrophe related activity and the litigation settlements  segment income would have increased million as compared to this increase is primarily due to higher net investment income of million and a million decrease in losses 
losses were lower in the current year due to million of higher favorable development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves  partially offset by approximately million of higher current accident year losses  primarily in personal lines 
these increases in segment income were partially offset by a slight net increase in underwriting and loss adjustment expenses 
life companies segment loss was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million in this increase was primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience  partially offset by lower operating expenses resulting from the continued run off of the business

also  positively affecting segment income was improved current accident year underwriting results of an estimated million  primarily due to earned premium growth in our inland marine and bond lines of business and favorable loss performance in most of our commercial lines of business 
net investment income increased by million  primarily due to improved operational cash flows  and other income increased by approximately million 
these items were partially offset by increased underwriting and lae expenses of million  primarily attributable to a million increase in variable compensation costs primarily a result of improved property and casualty group segment results  a million increase in stock based compensation primarily due to the impact of the new accounting for stock based compensation in  a million increase in investments in technology and million of higher expenses in support of our inland marine and bond business

this improvement is partially offset by the absence  in  of earnings from faflic variable products that were coinsured at december  our federal income tax expense on segment income was million in compared to an expense of million in the increase in federal income tax expense is primarily due to higher segment income in  as well as by a reduced level of tax exempt interest income

excluding the impact of all catastrophe related activity and the litigation settlements  segment income would have increased million for the year ended december   as compared to this increase is due primarily to higher net investment income and lower losses  partially offset by higher underwriting and loss adjustment expenses 
net investment income increased million 
this was primarily due to higher average invested assets resulting from favorable operational cash flows and additional holding company assets

favorable development on prior years reserves increased million  to million in  from million in current accident year results decreased approximately million in underwriting and loss adjustment expenses increased million primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs  principally in our commercial lines segment  partially offset by lower technology  variable compensation  legal and independent adjusters costs

we allocate net investment income to each of our property and casualty segments based on actuarial information related to the underlying business 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  this net written premium growth was primarily attributable to rate increases in the personal automobile and homeowners lines 
in the personal automobile line  rate increases in all states except for massachusetts contributed to overall growth of 
massachusetts rates declined in accordance with the commissioner s mandated and rate decreases effective april  and january   respectively 
in the homeowners line  growth of was driven by rate increases across most of our states and primarily in louisiana  florida  and michigan 
total personal lines new business in was million  a decrease of million from million in although new business decreased slightly compared to the prior year  we experienced growth in new business in the first quarter of  and subsequently experienced a decrease in new business during the last three quarters of this trend is expected to continue over the next several quarters 
partially offsetting these favorable items was lower retention  primarily on our michigan business  which we believe is partially driven by a weakening general economy 
additionally  management actions were taken to improve connections auto profitability  which adversely 
table of contents affected retention and new business 
also offsetting our premium growth in were coastal exposure management actions which resulted in the non renewal of certain homeowners policies in hurricane prone states 
policies in force in the personal automobile line of business increased in compared to the end of the increase was driven by business from connections auto  our multivariate auto product first introduced in and available in states  and by the appointment of new agents in states where we previously had little or no business 
policies in force in the homeowners line of business decreased in  compared to the end of  primarily as a result of declines in michigan  which we attribute to the declining economy in the state 
policies in force also decreased due to exposure management actions taken in coastal states 
partially offsetting this reduction is an increase in policies in force in newer  growth targeted states 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  declined million  from million in to million in this decline was primarily due to a reduction in current accident year profit of approximately million  primarily due to higher property losses in the homeowners line and to an increase in the frequency of losses in the personal automobile line 
additionally  underwriting and loss adjustment expenses were million higher due to higher salaries  employee benefit costs and survey and underwriting report costs  partially offset by lower technology  variable compensation and independent adjusters costs 
these decreases were partially offset by the aforementioned litigation settlement of million and higher other income of million  primarily due to increased policyholder installment fee income 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  excluding hurricane katrina  increased million  from million in to million in this increase was driven by favorable personal automobile liability experience  primarily in the through accident years 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes decreased million  from million in to million in in  we increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million 
in  there were no changes to our catastrophe reserves for hurricane katrina 
net investment income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to increased operating cash flows 
our ability to maintain and increase personal lines net written premium and to maintain and improve underwriting results is expected to be affected by increasing price competition  our ability to achieve acceptable margins  our ability to generate new business and to retain our existing business  regulatory actions  the difficult economic conditions in michigan  and our plans to continue to reduce coastal exposures 
beginning april   our overall personal automobile rate levels in massachusetts are expected to decrease approximately to as a result of the introduction of managed competition in the state 
such rates will be subject to further revision throughout the year  depending on the competitive and regulatory environment 
new business generally experiences higher loss ratios than our other business  and is more difficult to predict 
we have experienced loss ratios with our connections auto business which are higher than expected  particularly in states in which we have less experience and data 
we have initiated several actions to improve our results in new business  however  our ability to maintain or increase earnings and continue to grow could be adversely affected should the loss ratios for new business prove to be higher than our pricing and profitability expectations  or if required adjustments to enhance risk segmentation and related agency management actions result in making our products less price competitive 
in addition  at this time it is difficult to predict the impact on our written premiums or profitability of the transformation of the massachusetts personal automobile market from the fix and establish system to managed competition 
in addition  as discussed under contingencies and regulatory matters other regulatory matters on pages and of this form k  certain coastal states may take actions which significantly affect the property and casualty insurance market  including ordering rate reductions for homeowners insurance products and subjecting insurance companies that do business in that state to potentially significant assessments in the event of catastrophic losses that are insured or reinsured by state sponsored insurance or reinsurance entities 
such state actions or our responses thereto could have a significant impact on our underwriting margins and growth prospects  as well as our ability to manage exposures to hurricane losses 

table of contents commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to growth in our other commercial lines business  primarily inland marine and bonds 
for our more traditional lines of business  such as workers compensation  commercial automobile and commercial multiple peril  net written premiums for the year ended december  were relatively consistent with net written premiums in  as we sought to be disciplined in our underwriting process to maintain acceptable margins in an increasingly competitive pricing environment 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  increased million in  from a loss of million in to a profit of million in this increase was primarily due to continued growth in our inland marine and bonds lines of business and improved current accident year losses primarily in our workers compensation line 
these were partially offset by increased frequency of property losses greater than  in our commercial multiple peril and marine lines of business and increased expenses 
expenses were higher primarily due to increased investments in our inland marine and bond lines of business  partially offset by lower technology  variable compensation and legal costs 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  excluding hurricane katrina  increased million  from million in to million in this increase primarily relates to the other commercial lines of business 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes decreased million  to million in from million in in and  we increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million and million  respectively 
we are experiencing increasing competition in our commercial lines segment and are experiencing modest premium decreases on renewal policies  most notably in michigan 
the industry is also experiencing overall rate decreases 
our ability to increase commercial lines net premiums written while maintaining or improving underwriting results is expected to be affected by increased price competition and the difficult economic conditions in michigan 
other property and casualty segment income of the other property and casualty segment decreased million  to million for the year ended december   from million in segment income in includes a payment to opus in the amount of million in settlement of claims which opus alleged in a lawsuit filed in against various parties 
excluding this settlement  other property and casualty segment income would have decreased million in as compared to the decrease is primarily due to higher expenses in our premium financing business 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  in  net premiums written were negatively impacted by a reinstatement premium of million  resulting from hurricane katrina 
excluding the impact of the reinstatement premiums  personal lines net premiums written would have increased million  or  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to an increase in new business written in the personal automobile line due to the continued introduction of our product  connections auto  and to the related appointment of new agents 
policies in force in the personal automobile line of business increased in compared to policies in force at the end of this increase was due to new business growth in selected states as a result of the introduction of our connections auto product and the related appointment of new agents 
this increase was partially offset by reduced exposures in massachusetts and new jersey  where the decline in policies in force is primarily due to the reduction of certain unprofitable agency relationships and certain group business that was not well aligned with our current strategy 
policies in force in the homeowners line of business decreased in  compared to policies in force at the end of  while decreasing modestly by as compared to september  the decrease from prior year primarily reflects declines in michigan  massachusetts and new jersey 
in michigan  policies in force declined in compared to  while decreasing by as compared to september  we attribute this decline to the slowing economy in the state  which has affected new business production 
in massachusetts  the decrease was primarily driven by our decision to exit certain unprofitable agency relationships that were not well aligned with our current strategy and  to a lesser extent  by our actions to reduce coastal exposures 
in new jersey  we exited certain group business that was also not well aligned with our current strategy 
personal lines segment income increased million to million for the year ended december   
table of contents compared to million for the same period in this was primarily the result of fewer catastrophes  more favorable development of prior years loss and lae reserves and higher net investment income  partially offset by lower underwriting profit excluding prior year reserve development and the effect of catastrophes 
catastrophe related activity decreased million  from million in compared to million in  primarily due to hurricane katrina

average pre tax yields on fixed maturities were for the years ended december   and reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process we maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  taking into account actuarial projections at a given point in time  of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and policy coverage  and other factors 
we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  our actuaries develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the actuarial estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior years claims  the trend in loss costs  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
on a quarterly basis  our actuaries provide to management a point estimate for each significant line of our direct business to summarize their analysis 
in establishing the appropriate loss reserve balances for any period  management carefully considers these actuarial point estimates  which are the principal bases for establishing our reserve balances  along with a qualitative evaluation of business trends  environmental changes  and numerous other factors 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 
at december  and  total recorded net reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated point reserves  respectively 
management s review of judgments and key assumptions there is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation and other liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made 
in addition  the technological  judicial  regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims change regularly 
there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business  particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines  by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business 
in such cases  there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely 
historically  we have limited the issuance of long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical malpractice liability 
the industry has experienced adverse loss trends in these lines of business 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the 
table of contents period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are described separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation varies by product 
our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation and increasing medical costs in the projection of ultimate costs 
we have experienced increasing medical costs  including those associated with personal automobile personal injury protection claims  particularly in michigan  as well as in our workers compensation line in most states 
this increase is reflected in our reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
we regularly review our reserving techniques  our overall reserving position and our reinsurance 
based on i our review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii our review of per claim information  iii our historical loss experience and that of the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies written by us  and v our internal estimates of required reserves  we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on property and casualty segment income  based on full year premiums 
as discussed below  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years  excluding development related to hurricane katrina  developed favorably by million  million and million for  and  respectively  which represents  and of net loss and lae reserves held  respectively 
reserves for hurricane katrina developed adversely by million and million in and  respectively 
the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one line of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
in  we experienced significant catastrophe losses associated with hurricane katrina and established gross loss and lae reserves of million and incurred a reinstatement premium of million 
our loss estimate for hurricane katrina was developed using closed claims data  an analysis of the claims reported to date and estimated values of properties in the affected areas 
wind speed data  flood maps and intelligence provided by on the ground staff and independent adjusters  were used to project anticipated claims and damage projections 
anticipated costs for demand surge increased costs for construction material and labor due to the increased damage resulting from the hurricane were also included in the estimate 
however  estimating losses following a major catastrophe is an inherently uncertain process  which was made more difficult by the unprecedented nature of this event  including the legal and regulatory uncertainty  difficulty in accessing portions of the affected areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  delays in claim reporting  aggravating circumstances of hurricane rita and a slower pace of recovery resulting from the extent of damage sustained in the affected areas 
in and  trends in claims activity caused us to re evaluate and increase our estimate of hurricane katrina net loss and loss adjustment reserves  net of reinsurance  by million and million  respectively 
in commercial lines  we increased our estimate of net 
table of contents losses in  primarily due to the recognition of higher business interruption exposure as more complete information was provided by insureds in response to our initiative to obtain related documentation and to the impact of disputes related to wind versus water as the cause of loss 
additionally  for both commercial and personal lines in  we experienced the continuation of supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages as well as inflationary pressures on repair costs 
in  we increased our estimate of commercial lines net losses primarily due to an increase in recent litigation activity 
we believe this increase in litigation activity is due to the expiration  on august   of the two year limit for a policyholder to challenge hurricane katrina claims 
we also increased our hurricane katrina estimate in commercial lines in for supplemental payments on previously closed claims  similar to those experienced in the estimate of loss adjustment expenses related to hurricane katrina increased million and million in and  respectively 
an increase in litigation activity in resulted from the pre existing one year limit on a policyholders ability to challenge claims 
this one year limit was extended to august by legislative action  which we believe resulted in increased litigation activity in the third quarter of we are also defendants in various litigation  including putative class actions  which dispute the scope or enforceability of the flood exclusion  claim punitive damages or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation  all in connection with losses incurred from hurricane katrina 
the reserves established with respect to hurricane katrina assume that we will prevail with respect to these matters see contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters on pages and of this form k 
although we believe our current hurricane katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 
loss and lae reserves by line of business we perform actuarial reviews on certain detailed line of business coverages 
these individual estimates are summarized into nine broader lines of business including personal automobile  homeowners  workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril  and other personal and other commercial lines 
asbestos and environmental reserves and pools business are separately analyzed 
the process of estimating reserves involves considerable judgment by management and is inherently uncertain 
actuarial point estimates by lines of business are the primary bases for determining ultimate expected losses and lae and the level of net reserves required  however  other factors are considered as well 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the amount of data or experience we have with respect to a particular product or geographic area  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
the table below shows our recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  and the related actuarial reserve point estimates by line of business at december  and december in millions recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate personal automobile homeowners other personal lines workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial lines asbestos and environmental pools and other total the principal factors considered by management in addition to the actuarial point estimates in determining the reserves at december  and vary by line of business 
in our commercial lines segment  management considered the growth and product mix changes and recent adverse property related frequency trends in certain coverages 
in addition  management also considered the significant growth in our inland marine and bond businesses for which we have limited actuarial data to estimate losses and the product mix change in our bond business towards a greater proportion of contract surety bonds where losses tend to emerge over a longer period of time and are cyclical related to general economic conditions 
moreover  in our commercial lines segment  management considered the potential for adverse development in the workers compensation line where losses tend to emerge over long periods of time and rising medical costs  while moderating  have continued to be a concern 
in our personal lines segment  management considered the significant growth in our new busi 
table of contents ness with our connections auto product and related growth in a number of states where there is additional uncertainty in the ultimate profitability and development of reserves due to the unseasoned nature of our new business and new agency relationships in these markets  as well as emerging loss trends which are higher than expected 
our lack of credible actuarial data to estimate losses in these new geographical areas and agency relationships and with this new product causes uncertainty in estimating ultimate reserves and requires considerable judgment by management 
also in personal lines  management considered the significant improvement in frequency trends the industry experienced during through in these lines of business which were unanticipated and remain to some extent unexplained 
management also considered the likelihood of future adverse development related to significant catastrophe losses experienced in regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other factors 
at december  and  total recorded net reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated reserves  respectively 
the table below provides a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending gross reserve for unpaid losses and lae as follows for the years ended december in millions reserve for losses and lae  beginning of year incurred losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverable provision for insured events of current year decrease in provision for insured events of prior years  favorable development hurricane katrina total incurred losses and lae payments  net of reinsurance recoverable losses and lae attributable to insured events of current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior year hurricane katrina total payments change in reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses purchase of professionals direct  inc reserve for losses and lae  end of year the table below summarizes the gross reserve for losses and lae by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial total reserve for losses and lae the total reserve for losses and lae as disclosed in the above tables increased by million in and decreased by million in the decrease in was primarily a result of payments to insureds for hurricanes katrina and rita 
prior year development by line of business when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
the following table summarizes the change in provision for insured events of prior years  excluding those related to hurricane katrina see management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages to of this form k for a further discussion of hurricane katrina by line of business 

table of contents for the years ended december in millions decrease increase in loss provision for insured events of prior years personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial voluntary pools decrease in loss provision for insured events of prior years decrease in lae provision for insured events of prior years decrease in total loss and lae provision for insured events of prior years estimated loss reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower than expected bodily injury and personal injury protection claim severity in the personal automobile line  primarily in the through accident years  and lower than expected severity of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the and prior accident years 
in addition  lower than expected severity in the workers compensation and other commercial lines  also primarily in the through accident years  contributed to the favorable development 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  was primarily the result of lower than expected bodily injury claim frequency in the personal automobile line  primarily in the and accident years  and lower than expected severity in the workers compensation line  primarily in the and accident years 
in addition  lower than expected frequency of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the  and accident years and lower than expected frequency of bodily injury claims in the commercial automobile line  primarily in the and accident years  contributed to the favorable loss development 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  was primarily the result of a decrease in personal lines claim frequency and claim severity in the accident year 
in addition  the commercial multiple peril line and other commercial lines experienced lower than expected claim severity in the most recent accident years 
partially offsetting these items was adverse development in the workers compensation line during  which was primarily the result of increased medical and long term attendant care costs 
during the years ended december   and  estimated lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million and million  respectively 
the favorable development in is primarily attributable to improvements in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years  primarily in the commercial multiple peril line  partially offset by an adverse litigation settlement in the first quarter of  primarily impacting the personal automobile line 
the favorable development in and was primarily attributable to the aforementioned improvement in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years which results in the decrease of ultimate loss adjustment expenses  primarily related to workers compensation and personal automobile bodily injury 
development in was also favorably affected by claims process improvement initiatives taken by us during the to calendar year period 
although we have experienced significant favorable development in both losses and lae in recent years  there can be no assurance that this level of favorable development will occur in the future 
we believe that we will experience less favorable development in future years than we experienced recently 
the factors that resulted in the favorable development of prior year reserves are considered in our ongoing process for establishing current accident year reserves 
in light of our recent years of favorable development  the factors driving this development were considered to varying degrees in setting the more recent years accident year reserve 
as a result  we expect the current and most recent accident year reserves not to develop as favorably as they have in the past 
asbestos and environmental reserves although we attempt to limit our exposures to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability through specific policy exclusions  we have been and may continue to be subject to claims related to these exposures 
the following table summarizes our business asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance and excluding pools 

table of contents for the years ended december in millions asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total beginning reserves incurred losses and lae paid losses and lae ending reserves ending loss and lae reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  included in the reserve for losses and lae  were million  million and million  net of reinsurance of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  we reduced our asbestos and environmental reserves by million 
in recent years average asbestos and environmental payments have declined modestly 
as a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and lae incurred experience 
in addition  and not included in the numbers above  we have established loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation  however  we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant 
a significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool from to in  the pool was dissolved and since that time  the business has been in runoff 
our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from to during these years 
our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately million annually over the past ten years 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  we cannot provide assurance that our reserves will be sufficient 
we estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability claims  whether resulting from direct business  assumed reinsurance or pool business  based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant 
we believe that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
nevertheless  the asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised  and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position 
reinsurance our property and casualty group maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and lae activity 
we utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements that are intended to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses  stabilize earnings and protect capital resources  including facultative reinsurance  excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
we determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured  exposure analyses prepared by consultants and or reinsurers and on market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on an ongoing review of our reinsurers financial statements  reported financial strength ratings from rating agencies  and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors  we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect us  as the ceding insurer  from significant losses arising from a single event such as snow  ice storm  windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements  we had ceded losses and lae of million in  primarily as a result of hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
there were million of ceded losses under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements in in  we purchased catastrophe reinsurance coverage  which provided for maximum loss coverage limits of 
table of contents million and a combined co participation and retention level of million of losses for a single event 
our catastrophe coverage provided maximum loss coverage limits of million with a combined co participation and retention level of million of losses for a single event 
the program contains an automatic reinstatement premium provision in the event we exhaust this maximum coverage 
although we believe the increase in coverage and retention for is appropriate given our increased surplus and the current reinsurance pricing environment  there can be no assurance that this reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during see reinsurance in item business on pages to of this form k for further information on our reinsurance programs 
we are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms 
as a condition to conduct certain businesses in various states  we are required to participate in residual market mechanisms and pooling arrangements which provide insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage 
these market mechanisms and pooling arrangements include  among others  the massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers and the michigan catastrophic claims association 
life companies on december   we sold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of afliac  a life insurance subsidiary representing approximately of our run off variable life insurance and annuity business  to goldman sachs 
the transaction also included the reinsurance of of the variable business of faflic 
in connection with these transactions  faflic provided transition services to goldman sachs from december  through december  see loss on sale of afliac variable life insurance and annuity business on pages and of this form k 
our life companies segment is discussed in two major components continuing operations and discontinued operations 
continuing operations our life companies continuing operations business  all of which is in runoff  consists primarily of traditional life insurance products principally the closed block  a block of retirement products  and two remaining gics

other operating expenses includes interest credited to the holders of such gics of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
compared to life companies continuing operations segment loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million during the same period in this increase was primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience in our group retirement and traditional lines of business 
these increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses resulting from the run off of the business  coupled with lower losses from our gic line of business 
compared to life companies continuing operations segment loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million during the same period in this improvement was primarily due to lower expenses resulting from the run off of our continuing life business and due to lower losses in our gic business 
the improvement in was partially offset by the absence  in  of earnings from faflic variable products that were coinsured at december  discontinued operations the discontinued operations reflects the results of operations for the period that afliac was part of thg and net costs and recoveries associated with the aforementioned sale of afliac 
those net costs and recoveries primarily include  employee severance costs  indemnification expenses  transition services and operations conversion costs  as well as the net loss we incurred on the sale of afliac in

total investment assets were approximately billion for both years ended december  and during  investment assets decreased million  or  of which cash and cash equivalents decreased million  partially offset by a million increase in fixed maturities 
cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to a decline in the balance of collateral held related to our securities lending program 
fixed maturities increased primarily due to purchases resulting from improved operational cash flows in our property and casualty group and the acquisition of professionals direct  inc investment assets 
these increases were partially offset by the sale of fixed maturities in the life companies to fund the run off of our life operations

in our determination of other than temporary impairments  we consider several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  the length of time in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost  and with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
we apply these factors to all securities 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as a realized loss  which reduces net income and earnings per share 
temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive income 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will  in fact  be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturities and equity securities that have been continuously in an unrealized loss position 
december in millions gross unrealized losses fair value gross unrealized losses fair value investment grade fixed maturities months or less greater than months total investment grade fixed maturities below investment grade fixed maturities months or less greater than months total below investment grade fixed maturities equity securities total fixed maturities and equity securities we had approximately million of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at both december  and gross unrealized losses of below investment grade fixed maturities and equity securities increased million primarily due to the impact of increased credit spreads in fixed maturities 
the decrease of million in gross unrealized losses of investment grade fixed maturity investments is primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates in as compared to obligations of the us treasury  us government and agency securities  states and political subdivisions had associated gross unrealized losses of million at december  and million at december  at both december  and  substantially all below investment grade securities with an unrealized loss had been rated by the naic  standard poor s or moody s 
we view the gross unrealized losses of fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary since it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term 
furthermore  as of december   we had the intent and ability to retain such investments for the period of time anticipated to allow for this expected recovery in fair value 
the risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from our 
table of contents expectations  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  the unrealized loss would then be realized and we would record a charge to earnings 
although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other than temporary  the fair value of the underlying investment  which does reflect the unrealized loss  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period  and for equity securities at december  and actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations  with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed securities are included in the category representing their ultimate maturity

although we did not experience defaults in  any defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio in future periods may negatively affect investment income 
market risk and risk management policies interest rate sensitivity our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations which may adversely impact the valuation of the investment portfolio 
in a rising interest rate environment  the value of the fixed income sector  which comprises of our total portfolio  may decline as a result of decreases in the fair market value of the securities 
our intent is to hold securities to maturity and recover the decline in valuation as prices accrete to par 
however  our intent may change prior to maturity due to changes in the financial markets or our analysis of an issuer s credit metrics and prospects 
interest rate fluctuations may also reduce net investment income and as a result  profitability 
the portfolio may realize lower yields and therefore lower net investment income on securities because the securities with prepayment and call features may prepay at a different rate than originally projected 
in a declining interest rate environment  prepayments and calls may increase as issuers exercise their option to refinance at lower rates 
the resulting funds would be reinvested at lower yields 
in a rising interest rate environment  the funds may not be available to invest at higher interest rates 
we determine the appropriate asset allocation the selection of broad investment categories such as fixed maturities  equity securities and mortgage loans by a process that focuses on our types of businesses and associated products  the level of surplus required to support the different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes 
we look to balance the goals of capital preservation  stability  liquidity and after tax total return 
for our property and casualty business  we developed an investment strategy that maximizes income with consideration towards driving long term growth of shareholders equity and book value 
through fundamental research and credit analysis  our investment professionals seek to identify a combination of undervalued securities in the credit markets and stable income producing higher quality us government and agency securities  corporate and mortgage backed securities 
for our life business  our strategy is to generate investment income while maintaining stability of investment values and preserving capital 
as part of this approach  we develop investment guidelines for each portfolio consistent with the return objectives  risk tolerance  liquidity  time horizon  tax and regulatory requirements of the related product or business 
we have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across all portfolios 
we monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets  borrowers  industries  sectors  and in the case of direct commercial mortgages  property types and geographic locations 
in addition  we currently carry long term debt which is subject to interest rate risk 
the majority of this debt was issued at fixed interest rates of and 
current market conditions do not allow for us to invest assets at similar rates of return  and  therefore our earnings on a similar level of assets is not sufficient to cover our current debt interest costs 
the following tables for the years ended december  and provide information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are 
table of contents sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturities  unless otherwise noted below 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed and asset backed securities are included in the category representing their expected maturity 
available for sale securities include both us and foreign denominated fixed maturities  but exclude foreign currency swap contracts 
for liabilities that have no contractual maturity  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates based on our historical experience  management s judgment  and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
additionally  we have assumed our available for sale securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
specifically  variable rate available for sale securities comprise an immaterial portion of the portfolio and do not have a significant impact on weighted average interest rates

income taxes we file a consolidated united states federal income tax return that includes the holding company and its domestic subsidiaries including non insurance operations 
we segregate the entities included within the consolidated group into either a life insurance or a non life insurance company subgroup 
the consolidation of these subgroups is subject to certain statutory restrictions on the percentage of eligible non life tax losses that can be applied to offset life company taxable income 
the provision for federal income taxes from continuing operations in was an expense of million  compared to an expense of million in and a benefit of million in these provisions resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of  and on pre tax income for  and  respectively 
the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from a settlement with the irs of interest claims for through additionally both and include benefits of million and million  respectively  due to reductions in our federal income tax reserves resulting from clarification of outstanding issues for prior years in the course of ongoing irs audits 
the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from the settlement of disputed items in our federal tax returns filed for to  as well as a million benefit also resulting from a reduction in federal income tax reserves for prior years from ongoing irs audits 
absent the aforementioned benefits  the effective tax rates in  and would have been  and  respectively 
the slight increase from to is primarily due to higher underwriting income and a reduced level of tax exempt interest income in the current year 
the unusually low tax rate in reflects low underwriting income resulting primarily from hurricane katrina 
we expect that at current levels of underwriting income  our federal income tax rate in future years may continue to increase slightly due to reduced levels of tax exempt investment income and low income housing credits 
in addition to the aforementioned benefits from ongoing irs audits  we reached an agreement with the irs on our to audit cycle in december the resulting assessment of federal income tax was offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of our former subsidiary  afliac 
the recognition of these net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a million tax benefit recorded in discontinued operations as an adjust 
table of contents ment to the loss on the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business 
in addition  a benefit of million  also related to afliac items from to  was recognized in discontinued operations as income from our discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business 
we expect to settle the through audit cycle during without a significant adverse impact 
the irs audit for tax years through commenced in december during  we decreased our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by million  from million to million 
the decrease in this valuation allowance resulted primarily from unrealized appreciation of our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we recorded a decrease in the valuation allowance of million as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
this was partially offset by an increase in our valuation allowance of million related to our life company charitable contribution carryforward  as it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that this asset will not be fully realized 
this additional valuation allowance was reflected in our federal income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
included in our deferred tax net asset as of december  is an asset of million related to capital loss carryforwards 
our pre tax capital losses carried forward are million  including million resulting from the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business in a valuation allowance of million has been recorded against our gross capital loss carryforwards  since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that this asset will not be fully realized 
our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of capital loss carryforwards may change over time 
in addition  at december   we have a deferred tax asset of million  of which million relates to alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and million relates to low income housing tax credit carryforwards 
the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date and the low income housing credit carryforwards will expire beginning in we may utilize the credits to offset regular federal income taxes due from future income  and although we believe that these assets are fully recoverable  there can be no certainty that future events will not affect their recoverability 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no

as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was reflected as an increase in the january  balance of retained earnings 
a corporation is entitled to a tax deduction from gross income for a portion of any dividend which was received from a domestic corporation that is subject to income tax 
this is referred to as a dividends received deduction 
in this and in prior years  we have taken this dividends received deduction when filing our federal income tax return 
many separate accounts held by life insurance companies receive dividends from such domestic corporations  and therefore  were regarded as entitled to this dividends received deduction 
in its revenue ruling  issued on september   the irs announced its intention to issue regulations with respect to certain computational aspects of the dividends received deduction on separate account assets held in connection with variable annuity contracts 
revenue ruling suspended a revenue ruling issued in august that purported to change accepted industry and irs interpretations of the statutes governing these computational questions 
any regulations that the irs ultimately proposes for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment  at which time insurance companies and other members of the public will have the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the content  scope and application of such regulations 
as a result  the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are not yet known  but they could result in the elimination of some or all of the separate account dividends received deduction tax benefit that we receive 
we believe that it is more likely than not that any such regulation would apply prospectively only  and application of this regulation is not expected to be material to our results of operations in any future annual period 
however  there can be no assurance that the outcome of the revenue ruling will be as anticipated and should retroactive application be required  our results of operations may be adversely affected in a quarterly or annual period 
we believe that retroactive application would not materially affect our financial position 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of 
table of contents our financial statements 
additional information about our other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data on pages to of this form k 
property casualty insurance loss reserves we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves  as discussed in segment results property and casualty  overview of loss reserve estimation process based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  our actuaries develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the actuarial estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior years claims  the trend in loss costs  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
on a quarterly basis  our actuaries provide to management a point estimate for each significant line of our direct business to summarize their analysis 
in establishing the appropriate loss reserve balances for any period  management carefully considers these actuarial point estimates  which are the principal bases for establishing our reserve balances  along with a qualitative evaluation of business trends  environmental changes  and numerous other factors 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
specific factors considered by management in determining the reserves at december  and included the current extent to which growth and product mix changes in our commercial lines segment have affected our ultimate loss trends  the significant growth in our personal lines new business in and related growth in a number of states  the significant improvement in personal lines frequency and severity trends the industry has experienced over the past couple of years which were unanticipated and remain to some extent unexplained  significant growth and product mix changes in our surety bond and inland marine businesses for which we have limited actuarial data to estimate ultimate losses  and the potential for adverse development in the workers compensation line  where losses tend to emerge over long periods of time and rising medical costs  while moderating  continue to be a concern 
management also considered the likelihood of future adverse development related to significant catastrophe losses experienced in regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 
at december  and  total recorded reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated point estimates  respectively 
we exercise judgment in estimating all loss reserves based upon our knowledge of the property and casualty business  review of the outcome of actuarial studies  historical experience and other facts to record an estimate which reflects our expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on property and casualty segment income  based on full year premiums 
when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly see segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages to of this form k for further explanation of factors affecting our reserve estimates  our review process and our process for determining changes to our reserve estimates 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in 
table of contents which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
as discussed in segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages to of this form k  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years  excluding those related to hurricane katrina  developed favorably by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which represents  and of loss reserves held  respectively 
also in and  reserves for hurricane katrina developed unfavorably by million and million  respectively 
see also analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve development in item business on pages and of this form k  for guidance related to the annual development of our loss and lae reserves 
the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one line of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
in  our loss estimate for hurricane katrina was developed using an analysis of the claims reported to date and estimated values of properties in the affected areas 
wind speed data  flood maps and intelligence provided by on the ground staff and independent adjusters were used to project anticipated claims and damage projections 
anticipated costs for demand surge increased costs for construction material and labor due to the increased damage resulting from the hurricane were also included in the estimate 
however  estimating losses following a major catastrophe is an inherently uncertain process  which was made more difficult by the unprecedented nature of this event  including the legal and regulatory uncertainty  difficulty in accessing portions of the affected areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  delays in claim reporting  aggravating circumstances of hurricane rita and a slower pace of recovery resulting from the extent of damage sustained in the affected areas 
in and  trends in claims activity caused us to re evaluate and increase our estimate of hurricane katrina net loss and loss adjustment reserves by million and million  respectively 
in commercial lines  we increased our estimate of net losses in  primarily due to the recognition of higher business interruption exposure as more complete information was provided by insureds in response to our initiative to obtain related documentation and to the impact of disputes related to wind versus water as the cause of loss 
additionally  for both commercial and personal lines in  we experienced the continuation of supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages as well as inflationary pressures on repair costs 
in  we increased our estimate of commerical lines net losses primarily due to an increase in recent litigation activity 
we believe this increase in litigation activity is due to the expiration  on august   of the two year limit for a policyholder to challenge hurricane katrina claims 
we also increased our hurricane katrina estimate in commercial lines in for supplemental payments on previously closed claims  similar to those experienced in the estimate of loss adjustment expenses related to hurricane katrina increased million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in litigation activity in resulted from the pre existing one year limit on a policyholders ability to challenge claims 
this one year limit was extended to august by legislative action  which we believe resulted in increased litigation activity in the third quarter of we are also defendants in various litigation  including putative class actions  which dispute the scope or enforceability of the flood exclusion  claim punitive damages or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation  all in connection with losses incurred from hurricane katrina 
the reserves established with respect to hurricane katrina assume that we will prevail with respect to these matters see contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters on pages to of this form k 
although we believe our current hurricane 
table of contents katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 
property casualty reinsurance recoverables we share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
as a result  when we experience loss events that are subject to the reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
pension benefit obligations prior to  we provided pension retirement benefits to substantially all of our employees based on a defined benefit cash balance formula 
in addition to the cash balance allocation  certain transition group employees  who had met specified age and service requirements as of december   were eligible for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees years of service and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment 
as of january   the defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
we account for our pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements    and r and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions statement no 

in order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans  we must make various estimates and key assumptions  including discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances 
in addition  we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with this plan 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
we also use this discount rate in the determination of our pre tax pension expense or benefit 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we determined our discount rate utilizing the citigroup pension discount curve as of december  at december   based upon our qualified plan assets in relation to this discount curve  we increased our discount rate to  from at december  to determine the expected long term return on plan assets  we consider the historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies  as well as current and expected asset allocations and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns 
for the years ended december  and  the expected rate of return on plan assets was and  respectively 
increases in actual returns on plan assets will generally reduce our net actuarial losses that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity 
our expense in of million included million of expenses for due to the correction in of participant data as discussed in other matters on page of this form k 
excluding the correction  we expect our pre tax pension expense to decrease by approximately million in from an expense of million in  to a benefit of million in this decrease in expense is primarily due to the aforementioned increase in the discount rate 
holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions are as follows discount rate a basis point increase in discount rate would decrease our pension expense in by million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by million and increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in by million 

table of contents significant transactions on october   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
under this repurchase authorization  we may repurchase our common stock from time to time  in amounts and prices and at such times as we deem appropriate  subject to market conditions and other considerations

on august   the commissioner of the florida office of insurance regulation issued a consent order which permitted us to non renew our florida homeowners insurance policies  beginning december   and continuing until all such policies are non renewed  which is expected to occur over the ensuing twelve months 
non renewal of these policies is expected to affect policies which represent approximately million in written premium 
florida agents whose customers will be affected by such non renewals will be offered appointments with another company  which in turn will offer to such customers new homeowners policies on substantially the same terms and rates as we had provided 
additionally  we have entered into an agreement with a florida insurance carrier pursuant to which we are deemed affiliated with such insurance carrier such that we are not prohibited from continuing to write personal automobile insurance in florida 
on august   we sold all of the outstanding shares of financial profiles  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  to emerging information systems incorporated 
we originally acquired financial profiles  inc in in connection with our then ongoing life insurance and annuity operations 
we received pre tax proceeds of million from the transaction and recognized an after tax gain of million in in  we recognized an additional gain of million for certain tax benefits associated with the sale 
on december   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
as of may   we completed this share repurchase program  with repurchases of million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
on december   we sold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of afliac  a life insurance subsidiary representing approximately of our run off variable life insurance and annuity business  to goldman sachs 
the transaction also included the reinsurance of of the variable business of faflic 
in connection with these transactions  allmerica investment trust agreed to transfer certain assets and liabilities of its funds to certain goldman sachs variable insurance trust managed funds through a fund reorganization transaction 
finally  we agreed to sell to goldman sachs all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of allmerica financial investment management services  inc  our investment advisory subsidiary  concurrently with the consummation of the fund reorganization transaction 
the fund reorganization transaction was consummated on january  for the year ended december   we recorded a loss million  related to this sale transaction 
in connection with the sale  faflic provided transition services from the december  closing through december  costs associated with these transition services and additional costs provided for indemnification obligations to goldman sachs in connection with the sale  totaled million as of december  in we received benefits of million associated with this business  primarily related to a tax settlement with the irs see income taxes on pages and of this form k 
these were reflected in and  respectively as a gain loss on disposal of variable life insurance and annuity business 
statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk based capital rbc 
rbc ratios for regulatory purposes  as described in the glossary  are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the authorized control level the regulatory scale  however  in the insurance industry rbc ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the company action level 
set forth below are total adjusted capital  the company action level  the authorized control level and rbc ratios for faflic and hanover insurance  as of december  and december   expressed both on the industry scale total adjusted capital divided by the company action level and regulatory scale total adjusted capital divided by authorized control level

faflic s total adjusted capital is reported net of the million dividend declared to the holding company in december the total adjusted statutory capital position of hanover insurance improved during  from billion at december  to billion at december  this increase is primarily due to improved underwriting results in our property and casualty business 
the total adjusted statutory capital position of faflic improved during  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in statutory surplus primarily resulted from the recognition of tax attributes  partially offset by reserve strengthening in our group retirement line of business  an increase in our pension liabilities  changes in assets for statutory purposes and higher litigation costs 
the improvement of faflic s rbc ratios reflects the increase in statutory surplus as well as lower required risk based capital primarily due to lower asset and statutory reserve levels as a result of scheduled gic maturities  coinsurance  and continued business run off 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
however  dividend payments to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by state regulators  such as the requirement that cash dividends be paid out of unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus 
as a result of this limitation  no dividends may be paid from faflic without the consent of the massachusetts commissioner of insurance 
also  the payment of extraordinary dividends  as defined  from any of our insurance subsidiaries is restricted 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with the massachusetts commissioner of insurance  upon the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business  whereby we agreed to maintain faflic s rbc ratio at a minimum of of the company action level on the industry scale 
approximately million is currently available to dividend from our property and casualty companies without prior approval from the insurance commissioners 
table of contents in the states of domicile 
during and  we declared no dividends from our property and casualty businesses to the holding company 
in january  the massachusetts division of insurance the division approved a million dividend from faflic  which was paid to the holding company in february in  the division approved a dividend from faflic of million effective december   which was paid to the holding company in in  in connection with the sale of the variable life insurance and annuity business to goldman sachs  the division approved both a cash dividend from faflic of million  including the million ceding commission related to the reinsurance of of faflic s variable life insurance and annuity business  and the distribution of other non insurance subsidiaries  from which the holding company received an additional million of funds 
these dividends were paid to the holding company in our sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums and fees collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
we periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from higher net written premium in our property and casualty business 
in addition  lower payments in associated with hurricane katrina also contributed to the increase in cash from operations 
these increases were partially offset by increased non hurricane katrina loss and loss adjustment expense payments 
the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from an increase in cash outflows for loss and lae payments primarily related to catastrophes

we believe our holding company assets are sufficient to meet our future obligations  which currently consist primarily of interest on both our senior debentures and our junior subordinated debentures  and to pay certain federal income tax liabilities expected to become due in we also expect that the holding company will be required to make payments in related to indemnification of liabilities associated with the sale in of the variable life insurance and annuity business 
we currently do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend funds from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund holding company obligations

qualified pension plan funding obligations represent estimated amounts necessary to be contributed to the plan to satisfy minimum funding obligations in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of these payments have been estimated through additional contributions may be required based on the level of pension assets and liabilities in future periods 
these estimated payments are based on several assumptions  including  but not limited to  the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate for benefit obligations  mortality experience  and interest crediting rates 
differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions will result in changes to our future minimum funding obligations 
non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect estimated payments to be made through plan year for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefits 
estimates of these payments and the payment patterns are based upon historical experience 
life contingent contract benefits relate to traditional life insurance contracts and reflect the estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders in the future 
the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts is based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these estimates include mortality assumptions  customer lapse and surrender activity  renewal premium and expense assumptions 
actual payments may differ from our estimates and could result in a significantly different future payment pattern 
the total contractual obligation exceeds the corresponding liability on the financial statements primarily because the financial statement liability has been discounted for interest 
group annuity pension obligations reflect the estimated cash payments due to annuitants as a result of policies purchased from us by their employers 
the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts is based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
mortality assumptions are the primary uncertainty in estimating these obligations 
the total contractual obligations exceeds the corresponding liability on the financial statements primarily because the financial statement liability has been discounted for interest 
during  we exited our group life and health insurance business 
certain group life and health benefit obligations relate to this discontinued business and primarily represent the run off of accident and health assumed reinsurance pool obligations 
the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts is based on historical experience and information provided by the administrators of each pool 
uncertainties relating to these estimates include mortality assumptions  morbidity assumptions  medical inflation costs and other factors 
actual payments may differ from our estimates and could result in a significantly different future payment pattern 
the total contractual obligations differs from the corresponding liability on the financial statements primarily because we have included approximate reserves related to business reinsured with other insurance companies and because the financial statement liability has been discounted for interest 
unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and lae reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and lae reserve payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates based principally on historical experience 
as of december   faflic variable business reserves of million  universal life reserves of million  individual health insurance reserves of million and certain group life and health insurance reserves of million have been excluded because substantially all of these obligations are reinsured with other insurance companies 
the related contractual obligations and cash flows are borne by the reinsurers

in  plaintiffs purchased two variable annuity contracts with initial premiums aggregating million 
plaintiffs  who afliac subsequently identified as engaging in frequent transfers of significant sums between sub accounts that in our opinion constituted market timing  were subject to restrictions upon such trading that afliac imposed in december plaintiffs allege that such restrictions constituted a breach of the terms of the annuity contracts 
in december  the court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs  holding that at least certain restrictions imposed on their trading activities violated the terms of the annuity contracts 
on may   plaintiffs filed a brief statement of damages in which  without quantifying their damage claim  they outlined a claim for i amounts totaling  for surrender charges imposed on the partial surrender by plaintiffs of the annuity contracts  ii loss of trading profits they expected over the remaining term of each annuity contract  and iii lost trading profits resulting from afliac s alleged refusal to process five specific transfers in because of trading restrictions imposed on market timers 
with respect to the lost profits  plaintiffs claim that pursuant to their trading strategy of transferring money from money market accounts to international equity accounts and back again to money market accounts  they have been able to consistently obtain relatively risk free returns of between and annually 
plaintiffs claim that they would have been able to continue to maintain such returns on the account values of their annuity contracts over the remaining terms of the annuity contracts which are based in part on the lives of the named annuitants 
the aggregate account value of plaintiffs annuities was approximately million in december on february   the court issued a ruling which precluded plaintiffs from claiming any damages accruing beyond july  a jury trial on plaintiffs damage claim was held in december  which resulted in an aggregate award to plaintiffs of million for lost profits and reimbursement of surrender charges

hurricane katrina litigation we have been named as a defendant in various litigations  including putative class actions  relating to disputes arising from damages which occurred as a result of hurricane katrina in as of december   there were approximately such cases  at least two of which were styled as class actions 
these cases have been filed in both louisiana state courts and federal district courts 
these cases involve  among other claims  disputes as to the amount of reimbursable claims in particular cases  as well as the scope of insurance coverage under homeowners and commercial property policies due to flooding  civil authority actions  loss of landscaping  business interruption and other matters 
certain of these cases claim a breach of duty of good faith or violations of louisiana insurance claims handling laws or regulations and involve claims for punitive or exemplary damages 
certain of the cases claim that under louisiana s so called valued policy law  the insurers must pay the total insured value of a home which is totally destroyed if any portion of such damage was caused by a covered peril  even if the principal cause of the loss was an excluded peril 
other cases challenge the scope or enforceability of the water damage exclusion in the policies 
several actions pending against various insurers  including us  were consolidated for purposes of pretrial discovery and motion practice under the caption in re katrina canal breaches consolidated litigation  civil action no 
in the united states district court  eastern district of louisiana 
on november   the federal district court issued an order in these consolidated cases denying our motion to dismiss 
the court held that the flood exclusions utilized in the forms of homeowners and commercial lines policies issued by us and a number of other insurance carriers were ambiguous because such exclusions did not specify that they applied to flooding caused by negligent acts or omissions  as well as to flooding caused by natural incidents such as acts of god 
the plaintiffs in these cases claim  among other things  that the efficient proximate cause of their losses was the third party negligence of the army corps of engineers and the orleans levee district in the maintenance of the canal walls or in its failure to warn the plaintiffs and others of the impending water intrusion 
the federal district court ordered that discovery proceed on the questions of whether there was such negligence and whether such negligence was in fact the efficient proximate cause of such losses 
on august   the united states court of appeals  fifth circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court s opinion and holding that flood exclusions  such as those contained in our policies  are applicable to hurricane katrina related flooding irrespective of the cause of the flooding 
on november   plaintiffs filed with the united states supreme court a petition for a writ of certiorari requesting a review of this decision 
plaintiffs in several consolidated cases including sampia v 
massachusetts bay insurance company  ed la 
civil action number appealed an order of the federal district court dated august  rejecting plaintiffs contention that the louisiana valued policy law has the effect of requiring coverage for a total loss proximately caused by a non covered peril so long as there was any covered loss 
this consolidated appeal was heard by the united states court of appeals  fifth circuit  in a case captioned chauvin  et al  v 
state farm fire casualty co  no 
on august   the fifth circuit court issued an opinion upholding the district court decision dismissing plaintiffs claims 
plaintiffs thereafter filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court  which was denied on january  on august   the state of louisiana individually and on behalf of the state of louisiana  division of administration  office of community development filed a putative class action in the civil district court for the parish of orleans  state of louisiana  entitled state of louisiana  individually and on behalf of state of louisiana  division of administration  office of community development ex rel the honorable charles c

aaa insurance  et al  no 
the complaint named as defendants over foreign and domestic insurance carriers  including us 
plaintiff seeks to represent a class of current and former louisiana citizens who have applied for and received or will receive funds through louisiana s road home program 
on august   plaintiff filed an amended petition in this case  asserting myriad claims including claims under louisiana s valued policy law  as well as claims for breach of contract  the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  fiduciary duty and louisiana s bad faith statutes 
plaintiff seeks relief in the form of  among other things  
table of contents declarations that a the efficient proximate cause of losses suffered by putative class members was windstorm  a covered peril under their policies  b the second efficient proximate cause of their losses was storm surge  which plaintiff contends is not excluded under class members policies  c the damage caused by water entering affected parishes of louisiana does not fall within the definition of flood  d the damages caused by water entering orleans parish and the surrounding area was a result of man made occurrence and are properly covered under class members policies  e many class members suffered total losses to their residences  and f many class members are entitled to recover the full value for their residences stated on their policies pursuant to the louisiana valued policy law 
in accordance with these requested declarations  plaintiff seeks to recover amounts that it alleges should have been paid to policyholders under their insurance agreements  as well as penalties  attorneys fees  and costs 
the case has been consolidated into the case in re katrina canal breaches consolidated litigation referenced above 
we continue to vigorously defend these matters and other cases related to losses incurred in connection with hurricane katrina 
the fifth circuit court s decisions in the federal court cases are not legally binding on the state courts  and the effect of these decisions may be affected by subsequent decisions issued by the supreme court of louisiana  including cases to which we are not a party 
two such cases are presently pending before the supreme court of louisiana  where they are scheduled for oral argument on february  one of these cases  sher v 
lafayette insurance company  et al  no 
c  involves a claim by the plaintiff similar to that raised in the in re katrina canal breaches litigation and ultimately rejected by the fifth circuit  that the insurer s flood exclusion was ambiguous in that it did not specify that it applied to flooding caused by negligent acts or omissions 
the other case  landry v 
louisiana citizens property insurance corporation  no 
c  includes an assertion by the plaintiffs similar to that considered and rejected by the fifth circuit in chauvin  et al  v 
state farm fire casualty co 
that the effect of louisiana s valued policy law is to render a total loss caused by a non covered peril as covered so long as accompanied by any covered loss 
we believe that the flood exclusions at issue are unambiguous and enforceable 
however  a final non appealable order that our flood exclusions do not exclude losses from flooding caused by third party negligence and a determination that such negligence was the efficient proximate cause of such flooding or that such an exclusion is inapplicable where any portion of a loss is attributable to a covered peril  would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position  as well as on our results of operations 
we have established our loss and lae reserves on the assumption that the flood exclusion will be found to be enforceable and effective to exclude losses caused by third party negligence  as well as by acts of god  and that the application of the valued policy law will not result in our having to pay damages for perils not otherwise covered other matters we have been named a defendant in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business  including one other suit which  like the emerald case described above  challenges our imposition of certain restrictions on trading funds invested in separate accounts 
in addition  we are involved  from time to time  in investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies 
the potential outcome of any such action  or regulatory proceedings or other legal proceedings in which we have been named a defendant  and our ultimate liability  if any  from such action or legal proceedings  is difficult to predict at this time 
in our opinion  based on the advice of legal counsel  the ultimate resolutions of such proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position  although they could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
other regulatory matters during  the massachusetts commissioner of insurance issued two decisions pertaining to personal automobile insurance 
the first decision calls for the end of the fix and establish system of setting automobile rates and replaces it with a system of managed competition 
the second decision orders the implementation of an assigned risk plan beginning with new business as of april  the commissioner of insurance has issued a regulation providing the framework for the transition from a market in which the rates are set by the commissioner to one in which companies propose their own rates 
our rate filing was approved by the massachusetts division of insurance on january  and is expected to be implemented in the second quarter of over the course of the year  we currently anticipate overall rate level decreases of approximately to 
certain massachusetts legislators have called for legislation to be passed that would limit the implementation of managed competition 
reportedly  the legislators seek to implement a number of restrictions on the implementation of managed competition  including a limit on the type of permissible rating factors 
it is uncertain as to whether the legislation will be enacted and if enacted  what effect  
table of contents if any  it would have on our business 
in any event  it is anticipated that personal automobile rates will decline in  as noted above 
the assigned risk plan would distribute the massachusetts residual automobile market based on individual policyholder assignments rather than assigning carriers exclusive representative producers 
we believe the assigned risk plan would provide for a more equitable distribution of residual market risks across all carriers in the market  and therefore  such plan  if implemented  is not likely to adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
legislation was enacted in louisiana to extend the time period for louisiana homeowners who have policy coverage claims arising out of hurricanes katrina and rita to take legal action against their insurance companies from the pre existing month period to months from the date of loss 
the louisiana supreme court determined that the legislation is constitutional 
legislation was also adopted which increased an insurer s potential exposure if it is determined to have acted in bad faith in the claim adjustment process 
additionally  the state of louisiana continues to impose regulatory restrictions on our ability to reduce exposure to areas affected by hurricanes katrina and rita and to increase or maintain rates on homeowners policies 
during  the state of florida implemented several changes to the law impacting the property and casualty market 
most significantly  the legislation mandated that private insurer rates be adjusted to reflect projected savings in reinsurance costs realized through purchase of catastrophe reinsurance from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund 
newly enacted restrictions also require any company which writes personal automobile business in florida to write homeowners insurance in the state if it or any of its affiliates write homeowners in any other state 
we expect that such newly enacted legislation will result in more consumers purchasing insurance from the florida residual market for property insurance  thereby increasing the potential for significant assessments or other liabilities on private insurance companies in the event of a catastrophe 
over the past year other state sponsored insurers  reinsurers or involuntary pools have increased significantly  particularly those states which have atlantic or gulf coast exposures 
as a result  the potential assessment exposure of insurers doing business in such states and the attendant collection risks have increased  particularly  in our case  in the states of massachusetts  louisiana and florida 
such actions and related regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to reduce our potential exposure to hurricane related losses 
it is possible that other states may take action similar to those taken in the state of florida 
at this time we are unable to predict the likelihood or impact of any such potential assessments or other actions 
rating agency actions insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
we believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers  since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors
