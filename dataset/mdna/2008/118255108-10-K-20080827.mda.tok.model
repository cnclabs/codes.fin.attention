item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur  it could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our industry we are subject to the cyclicality of our industry 
the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose and absorbent products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
our financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
furthermore  a general economic downturn in a particular country or on an international scale  could reduce the overall sales within our industry  thereby likely reducing our sales 
we cannot assure you that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition and surplus capacity could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for our products are all competitive 
actions by competitors can affect our ability to sell our products and can affect the volatility of the prices at which our products are sold 
other actions by competitors  such as reducing costs or adding low cost capacity  may adversely affect our competitive position in the products we manufacture and  consequently  our sales  operating income and cash flows 
new competitors and the expansion of existing competitors could create a surplus capacity of the goods that we sell  which might cause us to either lose sales or lower the prices of our goods 
as examples of existing competitors expanding their production  sateri has announced that it will add  tons of specialty pulp capacity in braziland weyerhauser could reopen a mill with an annual capacity of  metric tons 
in addition  fiberweb and sambo have increased airlaid nonwoven production capacity in asia and concert has announced additional capacity in germanyin the fall of actions by our competitors and any surplus capacity could cause our profits to decline  affecting our operating results and financial condition 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of energy and raw materials are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
energy  chemicals  and raw material costs  including fuel oil  natural gas  electricity  cotton linters  wood  and caustic and other chemicals are a significant operating expense 
the prices and availability of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions  currency fluctuations  weather conditions  political unrest and instability in energy producing nations  and supply and demand considerations 
we have raw material availability issues at our memphis and americana specialty fibers plants 
we have the option to import cotton linters purchases for our memphis specialty cotton fiber production in order to minimize the impact of current constraints on north american cotton fiber availability 
we have limited production at our americana  brazil and memphis specialty fibers facilities because of raw material constraints 
for the near term  this raw material availability will limit growth and increase our production costs 
additionally  energy and chemical costs have increased substantially in recent years  which has resulted in increased production costs for our products 
increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to increased costs  it is possible that a disruption in supply of natural gas or other fossil fuels could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of transportation are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products  both domestically and internationally 
an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges and or a reduction in transport availability in truck  rail and international shipping could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner 
an increase in international shipping rates or fuel surcharges or a reduction in the availability of vessels could negatively impact our costs and our ability to provide products to our international customers in a timely manner 
while we have had adequate transportation availability  there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future 
risks related to our business exposure to commodity products creates volatility in pricing and profits 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
if our significant customer changes its purchasing habits  our business could be adversely impacted 
procter gamble is our largest single customer 
we supply procter gamble with fluff pulp and airlaid nonwovens  and sales to procter gamble accounted for approximately of our sales in fiscal year in the event that procter gamble fails to continue to purchase these products from us in substantial volume  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected  particularly if we are unable to attract new customers 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
as of june   our total debt was approximately million and our total debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was 
our level of debt could have a significant adverse future effect on our business 
for example we may have limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  our senior secured credit facility covenants require us to meet certain financial objectives and impose other restrictions on business operations 
these covenants and those contained in the indentures governing our senior and senior subordinated notes limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  our debt level and the various covenants contained in the indentures related to our senior notes  senior subordinated notes and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors  and our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at floating rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
our ability to pay principal of and interest on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  to service our other debt and to refinance indebtedness when necessary depends on our financial and operating performance  each of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
if we are unable to pay our debts  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  certain alternative strategies will require the consent of our senior secured lenders before we engage in any such strategy 
our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our negotiations with the representatives of the unions  to which many of our employees belong  are not successful  our operations could be subject to interruptions at many of our facilities 
as of august   we employed approximately  employees  of whom approximately  are employed at our facilities in the united states 
approximately of the us employees are represented by unions at two plants in perry  florida and memphis  tennessee 
our foley plant s labor agreement expired on march  and a new agreement is currently being negotiated 
the agreement for the memphis plant is in effect through march  the union at our canadian facility ratified a new labor agreement effective through june  employee representation is provided by a national union for non management workers at our specialty fibers plant in americana  brazil  and a works council at our nonwoven materials plant in steinfurt  germany 
our plants in gaston  lumbertonand king  north carolina are not unionized 
none of our facilities has had labor disputes or work stoppages in recent history 
the foley and memphis plants have not experienced any work stoppages due to labor disputes in over years and years  respectively 
we consider our relationships with our employees and their representative organizations to be good 
an extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
problems regarding the negotiation of any labor contracts could also affect our business 
the failure to renegotiate labor agreements in a timely manner could lead to a curtailment or stoppage of work at our factories 
if we negotiated a labor agreement on unfavorable terms  our production costs will increase 
a reduction in production or increasing the costs of production would lower our profits and harm our business 
compliance with extensive general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations requires significant resources  and the significant associated costs may adversely impact our business 
our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with these requirements 
because it is difficult to predict the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities in the future 
the foley plant  located in perry  florida  discharges treated wastewater into the fenholloway river 
under the terms of an agreement with the florida department of environmental protection fdep  approved by the u 
s 
environmental protection agency the epa in  we agreed to a comprehensive plan to attain class iii fishable swimmable status for the fenholloway river under applicable florida law the fenholloway agreement 
the fenholloway agreement requires us  among other things  to i make process changes within the foley plant to reduce the coloration of its wastewater discharge  ii restore certain wetlands areas  iii relocate the wastewater discharge point into the fenholloway river to a point closer to the mouth of the river  and iv provide oxygen enrichment to the treated wastewater prior to discharge at the new location 
we have completed the process changes within the foley plant as required by the fenholloway agreement 
in making these in plant process changes  we incurred significant expenditures  and  we expect to incur significant additional capital expenditures to comply with the remaining obligations under the fenholloway agreement 
based on the requirements anticipated in the proposed permit  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million over the next two years on in plant process changes  and additional capital expenditures of at least million over at least five years  possibly beginning as early as fiscal year the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factorsincluding when the permit is issued and whether there are any further changes to the proposed permit 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
these possible expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
because approximately of our sales are to customers outside the united states  we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations 
we have manufacturing facilities in four countries and sell products in approximately countries 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales of our products outside the united statesrepresented approximately of our sales 
the global economy and relative strength or weakness of the us dollar can have a significant impact on our sales 
in addition  although approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars  it is possible that as we expand globally  we will face increased risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including the risk that foreign currencies will be devalued or that currency exchange rates will fluctuate  the risk that limitations will be imposed on our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or on our foreign subsidiaries ability to remit dividends and other payments to the united states  the risk that our foreign subsidiaries will be required to pay withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to the united states or that the amount of any such taxes will be increased  the risk that certain foreign countries may experience hyperinflation  and the risk that foreign governments may impose or increase investment or other restrictions affecting our business 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discussing our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies 
executive summary buckeye manufactures and distributes value added cellulose based specialty products used in numerous applications  including disposable diapers  personal hygiene products  engine  air and oil filters  concrete reinforcing fibers  food casings  cigarette filters  rayon filaments  acetate plastics  thickeners and papers 
our products are produced in the united states  canada  germany and brazil  and we sell these products in approximately countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
we believe that we can continue to expand market share  improve profitability and decrease our exposure to cyclical downturns by pursuing the following strategic objectives focus on technically demanding niche markets  develop and commercialize innovative proprietary products  strengthen long term alliances with customers  provide our products at an attractive value and evaluate growth opportunities that match our specialty market focus 
buckeye had an excellent year  with record revenue and the highest earnings in eightyears 
highlights for fiscal year compared to fiscal year include net sales increased to a company record of million gross margin improved from to operating income was million versus million earnings per share were  up compared to the prior year long term debt decreased by million to million at year end net income increased to million total year earnings benefited from higher selling prices across all of our businesses 
we continue to see particularly strong demand and a strong pricing environment for our products in the specialty fibers segment of our business 
as a result of higher selling prices  improved product mix and improved chemical usage  our gross margin for fiscal improved to versus in fiscal however  our gross margin percentage trended down sharply during the second half of the fiscal year primarily as increased selling prices were not sufficient to offset the negative impacts of higher input costs  reduced production volume at our perry  florida wood cellulose mill and reduced capacity utilization at our canadian airlaid nonwovens plant 
transitioning our americana plant to a profitable operation continues to be a challenge as our sales out of that facility are constrained due to limited raw material supply 
while our operating loss is down significantly year over year  over the past four quarters our operating loss at americana has stayed fairly constant in the range of million to million per quarter  and we have been operating close to cash breakeven during that time 
over the past year  we have raised our selling prices aggressively to cover rapidly escalating cotton fiber prices 
selling prices for fiscal year were up and cotton linter costs were up 
we have also made some progress in improving our raw material supply  as total production tons for fiscal year were up about to approximately  tons 
our ability to prevent our operating results at this facility from deteriorating remains dependent on our ability to purchase cotton linters at an affordable cost 
further strengthening of the brazilian real versus the us dollar would also impair the profitability of this operation by about million annually for every ten basis point move in the currency 
we are moving forward on our foley energy project initiative 
the savings potential of this initiative continues to grow with the trend toward mandates on renewable energy sources and with higher oil prices 
our board of directors has approved total capital expenditures of million over a three year period for this project  which was based on a design goal of an equivalent reduction of over  barrels of fuel oil annually 
we have spent million of this amount through june  and have secured the appropriate construction permit in august 
additionally  upon the successful implementation of this initiative  we should be capable of producing excess energy and electricity using only biomass 
ultrafiber held its own in the face of a collapsing housing market as we continue to leverage the value of our ultrafiber dispensing system 
additionally  we are working to expand the use of ultrafiber in commercial construction  specifically in the concrete used on steel decks 
we recently confirmed that ultrafiber enhances the fire resistance of normal weight concrete  which could provide significant cost savings in the construction of multi level buildings 
finally  we are targeting growth in china  where a significant amount of concrete is being used to develop china s basic infrastructure needs 
strong cash flow generation enabled us to reduce long term debt by million during fiscal year our interest expense decreased million as compared to fiscal year this was a result of the lower debt and lower average interest rates which reduced interest expense by million partially offset by the million reversal of interest related to the cancellation of the stac pac technologies inc contingent note 
results of operations consolidated results the following table compares the components of consolidated operating income for the three fiscal years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  research and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles and other impairment and restructuring costs operating income net sales increased for the year ended june   primarily due to selling prices which were higher by approximately on average compared to the year ended june   accounting for million in incremental sales 
partially offsetting the impact of favorable price increases  fiscal year sales volumes declined versus fiscal year  accounting for a reduction in sales of million 
nonwovens accounted for the largest part of this sales volume impact million as a result of the loss of business with a large customer in january 
lower sales volume at our two specialty cotton fiber mills due to raw material availability issues also negatively impacted sales by million compared to the prior year 
our gross margin improved by million in fiscal versus fiscal our selling price increases of million more than offset the impact of higher costs for raw materials and the lower shipment and production volumes 
raw material costs were higher year over year million mainly for cotton linter fibers million and in our nonwoven materials million business 
increased chemical costs million overall were partially offset by lower usage at our specialty wood fibers facility 
higher energy costs had a negative impact of million and higher transportation costs reduced our gross margin by million compared to the prior year 
net sales were higher during the year ended june   primarily driven by higher selling prices across all segments of our business 
the shift from tolling operations to market sales at our americana specialty fibers facility contributed a positive mix impact 
a positive currency impact  due to the strong euro  added to the improvement 
shipment volume was down for the year ended june   mainly due to the closure of our specialty fibers facility in glueckstadt  germany 
the gross margin improvement from fiscal year to fiscal year was mainly a result of the higher selling prices discussed previously 
we also had improved operational results at our americana plant  lower energy costs  and improved capacity utilization at our north american nonwovens sites 
these improvements more than offset increased raw material costs in our cotton fibers and nonwovens business  increased transportation cost and higher plant direct costs 
selling  research and administrative expenses increased slightly in the year ended june  selling  research and administrative expenses decreased slightly in the year ended june  as a percentage of net sales these costs decreased to in fiscal year versus in fiscal and in fiscal during the second half of the year ended june   we entered into a restructuring program that complemented our operations consolidations and involved consolidation in our european sales offices  product and market development and corporate overhead 
the total cost of this program wasapproximately million and was completed during the first quarter of the fiscal year 
as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated 
further discussion of revenue  operating trends  impairment and restructuring costs can be found later in this md a 
additional information on the impairment and restructuring programs and charges may also be foundin note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements 
segment results although nonwoven materials  processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fibers segment consistsof our chemical cellulose  customized fibers and fluff pulp product lines which are cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
we make separate financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administration expense to each segment  and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the two segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  asset impairment  amortization of intangibles  certain financing and investing costs and unallocated at risk and stock based compensation 
we have reclassified the at risk compensation and stock based compensation from the specialty fibers and nonwovens segments for fiscal years and for comparability 
specialty fibers the following table compares specialty fibers net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income net sales increased in fiscal versus fiscal  primarily due to higher prices 
selling prices were up approximately on our wood specialty products and on our cotton specialty fibers products 
in fiscal  fluff pulp prices increased approximately per ton compared to fiscal shipment volume was down approximately  partially offsetting the favorable price increases 
operating income improved as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the favorable impact of higher selling prices million was partially offset by higher raw material costs million  mainly due to the increase in cotton fibers for which costs were up year over year 
in addition  higher chemical  energy and transportation costs reduced the favorable impact of the higher selling prices 
our operating loss at americana was reduced significantly in fiscal versus fiscal approximately 
increased pricing  higher production volume and reductions in fixed costs helped offset the higher cotton linter prices and the strengthening brazilian currency versus brl usd 
specialty fibers net sales improved during the year ended june  versus the prior year  primarily driven by higher selling prices and improved product mix  offset partially by the closure of the glueckstadt plant  which had a negative impact on sales volume 
strong demand in our high end specialty and fluff markets allowed us to raise prices during the year 
fluff pulp pricing increased by approximately per ton on the average during the year ended june  versus the previous year 
average selling prices on our high end specialty products increased in the mid single digit range for the year 
sales pricing and improved product mix were the primary drivers of our operating income improvement in fiscal costs as a percentage of sales increased compared to the prior year as the impact of lower energy costs was not enough to offset increases in transportation costs  raw material costs and factory direct costs 
our memphis and americana plants are working to solve the fundamental raw material supply constraints in north america and brazil  reduce operating costs and improve gross margins on an on going basis 
raw material availability continues to limit productionat these two sites 
according to the usda  in the us  cotton production decreased in the crop year and is expected to decrease another in the crop year harvested in the fall of 
according to the usda  in brazil cotton production in the crop year increased from the prior year and is expected to increase by about in the crop year harvest began in june 
in both cases  the amount of cottonseed that is delinted and crushed for oil determines our raw material supply  and this has not been increasing fast enough to meet our needs 
we expect that the amount of seed crushed for our fiscal year could increase approximately in brazil and is likely to decrease approximately in the united states 
we are strengthening relationships with our raw material suppliers to increase delinting capacity and assisting with their expansion plans 
improving our lint supply is a top priority  but will take time to implement 
as more lint becomes available  we intend to ramp up production levels at our cotton fiber facilities 
during our fiscal year  we expect to continue to operate the americana  brazil facility at its current rate of approximately  tons per month due to constraints on raw material availability  assuming we are able to purchase sufficient cotton linters at a reasonable price 
the memphis  tennessee facility is expected to run at approximately to of capacity during fiscal year  up slightly compared to  due to the constraints of the north american cotton crop 
nonwoven materials the following table compares nonwoven materials net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income nonwoven materials sales increased in fiscal versus fiscal strong sales volume in the first half of fiscal year was offset by weak volume in the second half of the fiscal year due to the loss of business with a long time customer 
shipment volume year over year was down from fiscal to fiscal we have recently replaced a sizeable portion of that lost business in north america 
we started to see the impact of this in june and anticipate that sales in the first quarter of fiscal should increase by to million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year improved pricing and improved product mix contributed million and million  respectively  to the sales increase 
the strengthening of the euro provided million of the increased revenues 
operating income decreased in fiscal versus fiscal the impact of higher sales prices was more than offset by lower volume  higher raw material costs for fluff pulp  bi component fiber and latex binder  and higher energy and transportation costs 
a strong market for nonwoven materials in north america contributed to the increase in net sales during fiscal year versus fiscal year increased demand resulted in higher sales volumes at increased selling prices 
we implemented similar sales price increases in europe during the year  and our sales volume remained stable 
additionally  net sales in europe saw improvement due to the strengthening of the euro during this time period 
most products sold at our steinfurt  germany facility are denominated in euros and translated to us dollars for consolidation purposes 
operating income improvement during fiscal year versus fiscal year was driven by the increased volumes and selling prices 
increased volumes in north america and the associated improvements in capacity utilization helped to improve operating margins during the year 
higher revenues from increased selling prices largely offset increased raw material costs in north america and europe 
corporate our intercompany net sales elimination represents intercompany sales from our florida and memphis specialty fiber facilities to our airlaid nonwovens plants 
the unallocated at risk compensation and unallocated stock based compensation represent compensation for executive officers and certain other employees 
we have reclassified the at risk compensation and stock based compensation from the specialty fibers and nonwovens segments for fiscal years and for comparability 
the following tables compare corporate net sales and operating loss for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income the operating loss for the three years ended june consists of millions unallocated at risk compensation unallocated stock based compensation intellectual property amortization restructuring expenses impairment on long lived assets gross margin on intercompany sales restructuring and impairment activities during the three years ended june   we entered into various restructuring programs  which resulted in restructuring and impairment charges 
in order to continue to provide both specialty fibers and nonwoven materials at attractive values  we intend to continue to look for ways to reduce costs and optimize our operating structure 
the following table summarizes restructuring expense by program and impairment charges for the three years ended june  following the table is an explanation of the programs and the resulting impairment charges 
for further explanation of these charges  see note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended june total millions charges impairment charges restructuring costs restructuring program restructuring program total restructuring costs restructuring program in january  we entered into a restructuring program that complements our operations consolidations and involves consolidation in our european sales offices  product and market development and corporate overhead operations 
the total cost of this program wasapproximately million and wascompleted during the first quarter of the fiscal year 
as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated which should provide annual savings of over million 
restructuring program and impairments in january  we announced our decision to discontinue producing cotton linter pulp at our glueckstadt facility 
during fiscal  management reevaluated its estimate of fair value less the cost to sell the remaining equipment and determined an additional impairment should be recognized for equipment with a carrying value of million 
therefore  we wrote down the carrying value of the remaining equipment to its fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an impairment charge of million 
in september  the remaining assets were sold for million 
since we previously had written the value of these assets down to million  we recorded a gain on sales of assets held for sale of million 
during fiscal year  we began to actively market the land and buildings  and the equipment which had carrying values of million and million  respectively 
therefore  we wrote down the carrying value of the land and buildings to their fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an additional impairment charge of million during fiscal year subsequent to this impairment  we sold the land and building for million 
the closure of the glueckstadt facility resulted in the termination of employees  and restructuring expenses related to the closure of million over fiscal year and impairments during fiscal year  we began to actively market idled cotton linter pulping equipment at our specialty fibers lumberton  north carolina facility which had a carrying value of million 
management evaluated its estimate of fair value less the cost to sell the assets and determined an impairment should be recognized for the equipment 
we wrote down the carrying value of the equipment to its fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal year subsequent to this impairment  we sold the equipment for net proceeds of million 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for fiscal year versus fiscal year this improvement was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during fiscal and lower average interest rates 
this favorable impact was partially offset by the decrease in interest expense in fiscal year due to the reversal of million of interest related to the cancellation of a contingent note owed to stac pac technologies inc interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for fiscal year versus fiscal year this decrease includes the reversal of million of accrued interest previously discussed 
the remaining decrease was primarily due to lower debt levels 
the decrease would have been larger  but capitalized interest related to the americana project reduced last year s interest expense by million that was not replicated in fiscal the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt increased from at june  to at june  see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of variable interest rates 
loss on early extinguishment of debt costs fiscal year during fiscal year  we used cash from operations and borrowings on our revolving credit facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes and to redeem million of the notes 
as a result of these extinguishments  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expenses of million during fiscal year fiscal year during fiscal year we used cash from operations to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in and to make voluntary prepayments on our term loan of million 
as a result of these partial extinguishments  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal year fiscal year onseptember  we used borrowings on our revolving credit facility to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in as a result of this partial extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal year see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt issuance and related extinguishment 
gain on sale of assets held for sale in september  the remaining assets located at our glueckstadt facility were sold for million 
since we had previously written the value of these assets down to million  we recorded a gain on sale of assets held for sale of million during fiscal foreign exchange and other foreign exchange and other in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the income in fiscal was primarily due to foreign currency gains as a result of the strengthening of the brazilian real 
the income in fiscal was primarily due to million from a water conservation partnership payment received pursuant to our reduction in the daily water permit limit at the foley plant 
the expense in fiscal was primarily due to foreign currency losses as a result of the strengthening of the canadian dollar during the fiscal year 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal year  we decreasedour valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for net operating losses of the americana  braziloperations by million due to tax planning associated with intercompany interest charges offsetting the operating losses 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  we increased our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for net operating losses of the americana  brazil operations by million and million  respectively 
this was almost entirely offset by a reduction of valuation allowances in the amount of million related to certain state net operating losses and tax credits due to tax planning efforts 
the increase in our valuation allowance in fiscal year was primarily due to the allowance for losses of the americana  brazil operation 
effective june   many of the tax measures introduced in the canadian federal budget were passed into law 
included in the budget was a reduction in the general corporate tax rate to for  for  and for and later years 
as a result  the company remeasured its canadian deferred tax balances based on the reversal pattern of our temporary differences  resulting in a net tax benefit in fiscal effective december  canada enacted canada bill c which further reduced its canadian corporate tax rates to for  for  for  for and for and later years 
this further reduction in corporate rates resulted in an additional remeasurement of canadian deferred tax balances with a net tax benefit of in fiscal furthermore  changes in estimates and tax planning resulted in a net tax benefit of in fiscal related to utilization of canadian net operating loss carryforwards 
effective july  germany reduced its tax rates resulting in a million net tax benefit for fiscal related to remeasurement of german deferred tax liabilities based on reversal of temporary differences 
on july   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of the adoption  we recorded an adjustment of million to reduce retained earnings at july  at adoption and june   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and cumulative potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled million 
we include interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income before income taxes 
all unrecognized tax benefits at adoption would affect the effective tax rate  if recognized 
financial condition our financial condition continued to improve during fiscal year we are committed to reducing our debt  strengthening our operations and continuing to improve our profitability and cash flow 
liquidity and capitalization we have the following major sources of financing a senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
our senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain various covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of june   and believe we will continue to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
these sources of financing are described in detail in note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total debt and capital leases decreased million to million at june  from million at june  from june  to june   total debt decreased by million including the cancellation of the million note owed to stac pac technologies inc 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june   as compared to at june  and at june  on july   we established a new million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of july  this facility amended and restated our previous credit facility 
initially  we used the proceeds from this credit facility to pay the outstanding balance on the former credit facility plus fees and expenses 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility is grid based pricing  related to our total leverage ratio  at the agent s prime rate plus to or a libor based rate ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
we also used proceeds from this facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes  to redeem million of the notes in mid september  and for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
our credit facility contains covenants customary for financing of this type 
the financial covenants include maximum total leverage ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
during fiscal year and at june   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit facility 
on june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and we had million borrowing capacity on our credit facility 
the credit facility also contains a million increase option 
the portion of this capacity that we could borrow on a particular date will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranges from to per annum based on a grid related to our leverage ratio 
total costs for the issuance of the facility were approximately million and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the facility 
while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
treasury stock during fiscal years to the board of directors authorized total repurchases of million shares of common stock 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our common stockat a total cost of million 
at june   atotal of millionshares have been repurchasedunder these authorizations 
on august  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of common stock in addition to the million shares of common stock previously authorized 
repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and will be available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
cash flow cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june  and million at june  the following table provides a summary of cash flows for the three years ended june  millions operating activities net income noncash charges and credits  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment proceeds from sales of assets other investing activities net cash used in investing activities financing activities net borrowings payments under lines of credit payments on long term debt and other other financing activities  net net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to higher inventory levels  partially offset by improved profits of million 
the inventory increase was primarily due to increasing inventory levels of raw cotton linters from very low levels at the beginning of the year  and higher raw material costs across all of our businesses 
the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to improved profits of million  higher accounts payable and current liabilities and deferred taxes 
the higher current liabilities were the result of increases in taxes payable  incentive plans and general payables 
the change in deferred taxes was a result of our higher profits and the reversal of some federal and state valuation allowances being an offset to our net operating loss 
net cash used in investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment were consistent during the last three fiscal years 
we expect efficiency improvement and energy savings projects  maintenance capital  and environmental spending will result in total capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal we are moving ahead with the foley energy project 
our board of directors has approved total capital expenditures of million over a three year period for this project  which was based on a design goal of an equivalent reduction of over  barrels of fuel oil annually 
we have spent million of this amount through june   and our capital budget for fiscal includes million related to this project 
we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in the future to comply with environmental obligations at our perry  florida specialty fibers facility 
based on the requirements anticipated in the proposed permit  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million over the next two years on in plant process changes  and additional capital expenditures of at least million over at least five years  possibly beginning as early as fiscal year the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year  we used cash from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises to reduce our debt and capital leases by million 
during fiscal year  we used cash from operations and million received from option exercises to reduce our debt and capital leases by million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of june  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years greater than years long term obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations timber commitments linter commitments other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations amounts include related interest payments 
interest payments for variable debt of million are based on the effective rate as of june  of

recent accounting pronouncements see note  recent accounting pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to theconsolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operation 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directorsand with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectability of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
bad debt expense for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
deferred income taxes and other liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those future events 
in fiscal  we decreased our valuation allowance recorded against certain foreign net operating losses by approximately million 
in fiscal  we increased the valuation allowance recorded against certain foreign net operating losses by approximately million and decreased the valuation allowances recorded against certain state net operating losses and tax credits by approximately million 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
we record our world wide tax provision based on the tax rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant managerial judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
where we believe that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in our income tax returns 
on july  we adopted the provisions of fin  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
we record our unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities 
cumulative potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included as a component of income before income taxes 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets is determined to not be recoverable  we measure the potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their fair value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
based on the estimated fair values of long lived assets  we recorded no impairment charges in fiscal years and we recorded million for year ended june  if circumstances change  our estimated fair values may be impacted and have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations 
see note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning impairment charges 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have previously adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under the guidelines of sfas  goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives 
we utilize the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
this present value model requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows and an appropriate discount rate or weighted average cost of capital representing the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of future cash flows 
the discount rate is based on independently calculated beta risks for a composite group of companies  our target capital mix and an estimated market risk premium 
the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows were consistent with the reporting unit s internal planning 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
the determination of an impairment loss is complex and requires that we make many assumptions and estimates 
if our estimates of future cash flows or the underlying assumptions and estimates change  we may need to record impairment losses in the future 
see note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on long lived assets 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt and capital leases at june  were million and million and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates and would amount to a million increase in the fair value of long term debt as of june  we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding at june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to libor rates and usprime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
we and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
our euro exposure is internally hedged for the most part because a high percentage of both the sales and costs at our steinfurt  germany plant are denominated in euros 
we do not have any hedges in place to protect against fluctuations in the canadian dollar or the brazilian real 
our currency exposure to the brazilian real is approximately a million negative impact on profitability for every ten basis point strengthening of the real versus the us dollar 
we are continuously evaluating our foreign currency exposure and our hedging policy is subject to change 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
availability and cost of raw materials amounts paid by us for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of our variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond our control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber to the extent not reflected in prices for our products  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have raw material availability issues in our specialty cotton fibers business in both north america and brazil 
we have the option to import cotton linters purchases for our memphis specialty cotton fiber production facility in order to minimize the impact of the current constraints on north american cotton fiber availability 
currently our production is constrained by lint availability 
commodities we are dependent on commodities in our production process 
natural gas  electricity  fuel oil  caustic and other chemicals are just some of the commodities that our processes rely upon 
exposure to these commodities can have a significant impact on our operating performance 
in may  we entered into a seven year electrical power contract for power usage in brazil 
this contract bypasses the local utility company thereby reducing our energy costs by approximately million each year 
in order to minimize market exposure  we may use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of fossil fuels over a period of generally less than one year 
there were no fossil fuel contracts outstanding at june  or requiring fair value treatment 
exposure to commodity products also creates volatility in pricing 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp and other commodity products  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
industry cyclicality the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose based products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
it is not certain that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with such requirements 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
given the uncertainties associated with predicting the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities
