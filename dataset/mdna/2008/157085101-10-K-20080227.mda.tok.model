intercept blood system for plasma the intercept blood system for plasma  or plasma system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated plasma for transfusion 
we completed the last of three planned phase iii clinical trials of the plasma system in  and the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of the trials for therapeutic plasma exchange were met 
the study showed no clinically and statistically significant differences in overall adverse events between the treatment group and the control group 
a final phase iii report was submitted to the fda in based on the results of the phase iii clinical trials  we received ce mark approval for the plasma system in november and have prioritized the commercial launch of the plasma system in europe ahead of further regulatory efforts relating to the plasma system in the united states 
we obtained french in country approval of the plasma system in early in june  we signed an initial supply contract with the efs pursuant to a public tender process  which also applies to the plasma system 
however  broader adoption of the plasma system 
table of contents throughout france has been delayed pending budget authorization from the french ministry of health to support a larger national contract with the efs 
pathogen inactivated plasma is already reimbursed in many european countries  including france

intercept blood system for red blood cells the intercept blood system for red blood cells  or red blood cell system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated red blood cells for transfusion 
in september  we terminated phase iii clinical trials of the red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to intercept treated red blood cells in one patient in the chronic arm of the trial 
however  there were no medical sequelae associated with intercept treated red blood cells evident in this trial 
the antibody cleared and the patient had no adverse health consequences 
after unblinding the data from the phase iii trial  we found that we had met the primary end point in the acute arm of the trial 
we evaluated the antibodies detected in the trial and have developed process changes that may greatly diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in red blood cells treated with our modified process 
we announced several findings related to these evaluations and developments in late and at several scientific and trade association meetings 
based on these findings and other preclinical work we have conducted  we re entered phase i clinical trials for the red blood cell system in the united states in the second half with our modified process  which were completed in mid while we determined that the modifications we made in this phase i trial appeared to be safe  they resulted in irreversible deyhydration and unacceptably short lifespan of the treated red blood cells 
we are currently engaged in a series of in vitro and in vivo tests with further modifications to the red blood cell system to correct the shorter lifespan issue and plan to enter another phase i clinical trial in the second half of we expect to spend approximately two years developing and implementing commercial product and system design changes to the original red blood cell system prior to entering phase iii clinical trials 
collaborations baxter we collaborated with baxter on the development and commercialization of the intercept blood system commencing in effective february   we entered into a restructuring of our agreements with baxter pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to market  distribute and sell the platelet and plasma systems  excluding certain asian countries where the commercialization rights had been licensed to bioone 
we also obtained worldwide commercialization rights to market the red blood cell system from baxter in february in connection with the transfer of commercialization rights to us  baxter agreed to supply  at our expense  certain transition services  including regulatory  technical and related administrative support through december  we agreed to purchase uva illumination devices from baxter in inventory in february and  intercept blood system disposable kit finished from baxter s inventory for the platelet and plasma systems 
baxter agreed to manufacture systems and components for the platelet and plasma systems on a cost plus basis through december   and components through december   subject to extension under certain specified conditions 
baxter also agreed to supply only very limited types of components for the prototype of the red blood cell system 
we agreed to pay baxter royalties on future intercept blood system product sales at royalty rates that vary by product of product sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system and for the red blood cell system 
as a result of the restructuring agreement  we recognized gains and deferred gains in excess of million in and million in remaining deferred gains in as the services were completed by the vendors 
in march  baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company  fenwal inc  or fenwal 

table of contents we were informed by baxter that fenwal has assumed baxter s obligations to us under the manufacturing agreement and we are obligated to pay royalties on intercept blood system product sales to fenwal  rather than to baxter 
bioone in june  we entered into a definitive agreement with baxter and bioone for commercialization of our platelet system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for the platelet system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore in exchange for exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we have received a total of million in up front payments under the terms of the agreement and will be eligible to receive contingent milestone payments for our sole account and royalties on future product sales  which will be shared equally by fenwal  as the successor to baxter s interests  and us 
in june  we announced our entry into a definitive agreement with baxter and bioone for commercialization of our plasma system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for the plasma system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore in exchange for exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we understand that baxter transferred its rights and obligations with regard to bioone to fenwal in march prior to the year ended december   we received a total of million in cash and million in bioone equity securities in connection with the agreement  and will be eligible to receive i contingent milestone payments  payable to us solely  and ii royalties on future product sales  which will be shared by fenwal and us 
us armed forces in february  we were awarded million under a cooperative agreement with the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense 
in september  may  january  august  july  september  and january we were awarded additional funding of million  million  million  million  million  million  and million respectively  all of which was for the continued funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood for medical transfusions 
under the terms of the agreements  we are conducting research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens in blood  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  that are of concern to the us armed forces 
in november  we announced that we had sold certain assets that made up our immunotherapy business  including our listeria and kbma platform technologies  to a newly formed independent company  anza therapeutics  inc or anza  financed by venture capital firms  including kleiner perkins caufield byers  sofinnova ventures and versant ventures 
in exchange for our contribution of tangible and intangible assets to anza  we received an equity interest of approximately of anza s fully diluted equity 
in addition to equity  we are eligible to receive future cash milestone payments of up to in excess of million  as well as royalty payments  if vaccine candidates generated from the transferred assets are successfully developed and commercialized 
effective october   we ceased funding operations of the immunotherapy business that was transferred to anza 
the immunotherapy business is accounted for as a discontinued operation on our financial statements as of december  accordingly  we have restated our statements of operations for the years ended december  and to reflect that accounting treatment 
manufacturing and supply we have used  and intend to continue to use  third parties to manufacture and supply the devices  disposable kits and inactivation compounds that make up the intercept blood system for use in clinical trials and for commercialization 
we have no experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes 
we 
table of contents are dependent on fenwal for the manufacture of intercept blood system components and on contract manufacturers for the production of inactivation compounds  compound absorption components of the disposable kits and uva illumination devices used in the intercept blood system 
under our agreements with fenwal  as the successor to baxter s interests  we are responsible for developing and delivering our proprietary inactivation compounds and adsorption media to fenwal for incorporation into the final system configuration 
fenwal is responsible for manufacturing or supplying the disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems  such as blood storage containers and related tubing  as well as any device associated with the inactivation process on a cost plus basis through and components through  subject to extension under specified conditions 
we have contracted with one manufacturing facility for the synthesis of amotosalen  an inactivation compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
under this contract  we are not subject to minimum annual purchase requirements 
however  if specified quantities of amotosalen are not purchased in any year  we are required to pay a maintenance fee of up to  for such year 
we currently have a stock of the compound sufficient to support the anticipated commercial demand for the platelet and plasma systems in europe 
we and our contract manufacturers purchase certain raw materials for our inactivation compounds  materials and parts associated with compound adsorption devices and uva illumination devices from a limited number of suppliers  some of which may require minimum annual purchase amounts 
while we believe that there are alternative sources of supply for such materials  parts and devices  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the raw materials  parts and devices  if required  may not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs 
any failure to obtain from alternative suppliers any of the materials used to manufacture our inactivation compounds or materials and parts used to manufacture our compound absorption devices and uva illumination devices  if required  would limit our ability to supply these materials  parts or devices 
marketing  sales and distribution the market for the intercept blood system is dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations in the united states  western europe and japan  where various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood component supplies 
the largest european markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
in england  decisions on product adoption are centralized in the national blood service 
in germany  decisions on product adoption are expected to be on a regional or blood center by blood center basis 
while obtaining ce marks allows us to sell the platelet and plasma systems to blood centers in germany  blood centers in germany must still obtain both local manufacturing approval and national marketing authorization from the paul ehrlich institute before being allowed to sell platelets and plasma units treated with the intercept blood system to transfusing hospitals and physicians 
to date  one blood center in germany has received such requisite approvals and authorizations for the platelet system 
in france  decisions on product adoption are expected to be on a region by region basis under national supply contracts negotiated with the efs 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for product costs and related treatment of blood components from governmental authorities and private health care insurers including health maintenance organizations  which are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the extent of coverage and the reimbursement rate for new tests and treatments 
national reimbursement rates for platelet pathogen inactivation must be agreed upon between the french ministry of health and the efs before we would expect broad commercial adoption of the platelet system in france 
national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated plasma units have been set in france  but need to be extended to include the intercept blood system before we would expect broad commercial adoption of the plasma system in france 
prior to february  baxter had been responsible for the marketing  sales and distribution of the platelet system in the united states  europe and other regions not covered by the agreements with bioone 
baxter also 
table of contents had been responsible for the marketing  sales and distribution of the plasma system following marketing approval in europe and other countries  excluding north america  and the regions covered by the agreements with bioone 
as a consequence of the february agreement with baxter  we have established a wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  headquartered in the netherlands and are building our own independent marketing and sales organization based in europe to market and sell the intercept blood system in europe and the middle east 
we also have a small scientific affairs group that supports the commercialization efforts 
competition we believe that the intercept blood system has certain competitive advantages over competing blood borne pathogen inactivation methods that are either on the market  or in development 
the intercept blood system is designed for use in blood centers on a distributed basis with single units of blood products  which allows for integration with current blood collection  processing and storage procedures 
competing products in development or currently on the market  such as solvent detergent treated plasma  use centralized processing that takes blood products away from the blood center 
one potential competitor has recently received a ce mark for a pathogen inactivation process for platelets 
other competitors are marketing pathogen inactivation products or systems for treating donated plasma in europe 
there are no known competitors in the clinical development stage for pathogen inactivation of red blood cells 
in addition to direct competition from other pathogen inactivation methods  we encounter indirect competition from other approaches to blood safety  including methods of testing blood products for bacterial and viral pathogens 
further discussion of the major competitors to our blood product business can be found in the risk factor entitled if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
if competitors encounter difficulties or failures in human clinical trials or in commercial settings  we may face additional clinical  regulatory  and commercial challenges 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for pathogen inactivation of blood products will include the breadth and effectiveness of pathogen inactivation processes  the amount of demonstrated reduction in transfusion related adverse events subsequent to adopting pathogen inactivation technology  robustness of treated platelets  ease of use  the scope and enforceability of patent or other proprietary rights  product value  product supply and marketing and sales capability 
in addition  the length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and  in some cases  reimbursement approval are also important competitive factors 
we believe that the intercept blood system will compete favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the medical device and biopharmaceutical field is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes 
accordingly  our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and introduction of new products 
product development involves a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products 
patents  licenses and proprietary rights our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of us 
our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
as of december   we owned approximately issued or allowed united states patents and approximately issued or allowed foreign patents related to the intercept blood system 
our patents expire at various dates between and in addition  we have pending united states patent applications and have filed corresponding patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire from to proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that any patents owned by or licensed to us will afford protection against competitors or that any pending patent applications now or hereafter 
table of contents filed by  or licensed to  us will result in patents being issued 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
government regulation we and our products are comprehensively regulated in the united states by the fda and  in some instances  by state and local governments  and by comparable governmental authorities in other countries 
our european investigational plan has been based on the intercept blood system being categorized as class iii drug device combinations under the medical device directives  or mdd  of the european union 
the european union requires that medical devices affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the mdd 
the intercept blood system for platelets received the ce mark in october the intercept blood system for plasma received the ce mark in november a separate ce mark certification must be received for the red blood cell system to be sold in the european union 
several european countries require additional in country studies to support an approval to market the products in such countries 
the fda regulates drugs  medical devices and biologics under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
these laws and implementing regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  record keeping  storage  labeling  advertising  promotion and pre market clearance or approval of products subject to regulation 
the steps required before a medical device may be approved for marketing in the united states pursuant to a pre market approval application  or pma  include i preclinical laboratory and animal tests  ii submission to the fda of an investigational device exemption for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  iii appropriate tests to show the product s safety  iv adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the product s safety and efficacy for its intended indications  v submission to the fda of a pma  and vi fda review of the pma in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
in addition  the fda inspects the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice or quality system regulation requirements is satisfactory 
the fda will require a pma for each of the intercept systems for platelets  plasma and red blood cells 
in addition  the fda will require site specific licenses from our united states based blood center customers before they can engage in interstate transport of blood components processed using our pathogen inactivation systems  and a delay in obtaining these licenses would adversely impact our ability to sell products in the united states 
the fda regulates the intercept blood system as a biological medical device 
the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  or cber  is principally responsible for regulating the intercept blood system 
in addition to regulating our blood safety products  cber also regulates the blood collection centers and the blood products they prepare using our medical device 
before the fda determines whether to approve our blood safety products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac  an advisory committee convened by and reporting to the fda 
bpac will make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 
before a medical device may be marketed in the united states  the fda must approve a pre market approval application for the product 
baxter used a modular process for our pma application for the platelet system in the united states  which we have followed since assuming responsibility for regulatory activities in the us under terms of the february and agreements 
the content  order and submission timing of the modules must be approved by the fda  and a modular pma application cannot be approved until all modules have been submitted to  reviewed by and accepted by the fda 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to the intercept blood system  there are regulatory requirements applicable to our prospective customers  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and 
table of contents blood products 
blood centers and others will likely be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda before using the intercept blood system 
there can be no assurance that any blood centers will be able to obtain the required licenses on a timely basis  or at all 
to support applications for regulatory approval to market the intercept blood system  we conduct various types of studies  including toxicology studies to evaluate product safety  laboratory and animal studies to evaluate product effectiveness and human clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability and effectiveness of treated blood components 
we believe that  in deciding whether the intercept blood system is safe and effective  regulatory authorities are likely to take into account whether it adversely affects the therapeutic efficacy of blood components as compared to the therapeutic efficacy of blood components not treated with the system  and regulatory authorities will weigh the system s safety  including potential toxicities of the inactivation compounds  and other risks against the benefits of using the system in a blood supply that has become safer 
we have conducted many toxicology studies designed to demonstrate the intercept blood system s safety 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not require further toxicology or other studies of our products 
based on discussions with the fda and european regulatory authorities  we believe that data from human clinical studies is required to demonstrate the safety of treated blood components and their therapeutic comparability to untreated blood components  but that only data from laboratory and animal studies  not data from human clinical studies  will be required to demonstrate the system s efficacy in inactivating pathogens 
in light of these criteria  our clinical trial programs for the intercept blood system consist of studies that differ from typical phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical studies 
many of the intercept blood system preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted using prototype system disposables and devices 
we have or plan to perform laboratory studies to demonstrate equivalency between the prototype and the commercial configuration 
we cannot be certain that these studies will be successful or the fda or foreign regulatory bodies will not require additional studies  which could delay commercialization 
if we decide to seek fda approval of the platelet system for use in treating pooled random donor platelets  additional clinical studies will be required 
in addition  there currently are three principal manufacturers of automated apheresis collection equipment  including fenwal 
the equipment of each manufacturer collects platelets into plastic disposables designed for that equipment  thus  a pathogen inactivation system designed for disposables used by one manufacturer will not necessarily be compatible with other manufacturers collection equipment 
if we elect to prioritize regulatory efforts in the united states  we may initially to seek fda approval of the platelet system configured for fenwal s apheresis collection equipment 
if we determine that compatibility with other equipment is desirable  additional processing procedures and system configurations will need to be developed 
we believe that the fda will also require supplemental clinical data before approving our system for use with platelets collected using other equipment 
health care reimbursement and reform the future revenue and profitability of biopharmaceutical and related companies  as well as the availability of capital to such companies  may be affected by the continuing efforts of the united states and foreign governments and third party payors to contain or reduce costs of health care through various means 
in the united states  given federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  it is likely that the united states congress and state legislatures will continue to focus on health care reform and the cost of pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the products and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceuticals  medical devices and services 
the trend toward managed health care in the united states and other countries and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all affect the prices for our products 

table of contents employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in research and development and in selling  general  and administrative activities

risk factors risk factors our business faces significant risks 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business may suffer  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
there may be additional risks faced by our business 
all references to baxter in these risk factors should be read  as to future contingencies  to include fenwal 
the intercept blood system may not achieve broad market acceptance 
we may encounter governmental and blood banking community resistance to commercial adoption 
some potential customers may await further safety information or additional studies before choosing whether to adopt our products 
there is some loss of platelets as a result of our pathogen inactivation process 
if the loss of platelets leads to increased costs  or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens  customers may not adopt our platelet system 
our products do not inactivate all known pathogens  and the inability of our systems to inactivate certain pathogens may limit their acceptance 
in addition  our products may not demonstrate economic value sufficient to offset their price  imposing a financial burden on the healthcare system that may limit market acceptance 
for logistical and financial reasons  the transfusion industry has not always integrated new technologies into their processes  even those with the potential to improve the safety of the blood supply  such as the intercept blood system 
our products may require significant changes to our potential customers blood component collection methods  space and staffing requirements and potential customers may not believe that the benefits of using the intercept blood system justify their additional cost 
in addition  our platelet system process today is not fully compatible with the common practice of collecting two units of platelets from a single apheresis donor 
if customers experience operational or technical problems with the use of intercept blood system products  market acceptance may be reduced 
for example  if adverse events arise from incomplete inactivation of pathogens  improper processing or user error  or if testing of intercept blood system treated blood samples fails to reliably confirm pathogen inactivation  whether or not directly attributable to a shortcoming of the intercept blood system  customers may refrain from purchasing the products 
market acceptance of our products may also be affected by blood center budgets and the availability of reimbursement from governments  managed care payors  such as insurance companies  or other third parties 
in many cases  due to the structure of the blood products industry  we will have little control over budget and reimbursement discussions  which generally occur between blood centers and national or regional ministries of health and private payors 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel medical 
table of contents device products 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of medical products and medical products companies 
there also have been proposals in the united states  at both the federal and state government level  to implement such controls 
the widespread adoption of managed care in the united states has also placed pressure on the pricing of medical products 
these pressures can be expected to continue and may limit the prices we can obtain for our products 
product revenue in europe and other regions may be negatively affected because we do not have fda approval for any of our products  nor are we prioritizing seeking such approval 
not prioritizing pursuit of regulatory approval of the intercept blood system in the united states historically in favor of focusing on commercializing the intercept blood system in europe  asia and the middle east may have adverse consequences on market acceptance of the intercept blood system globally 
if the intercept blood system products fail to achieve market acceptance  we may never become profitable 
the market for the intercept blood system is highly concentrated with few customers  including often dominant regional or national blood collection entities 
even if our products receive regulatory approval and reimbursement is available  failure to properly market  promote  distribute  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly diminish potential product revenue in those geographies 
the market for our pathogen inactivation systems in the united states is highly concentrated  dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations 
in many countries in western europe and in japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
in europe  the largest markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
decisions on product adoption in england are centralized with the national blood service  where general cost containment pressures have delayed consideration of the intercept blood system to date 
in germany  decisions on product adoption and subsequent reimbursement are expected to be on a regional or even blood center by blood center basis  but depend on both local and centralized regulatory approvals 
while the platelet and plasma systems have received in country regulatory approval in france  adoption throughout france has been delayed pending budget authorization from the french ministry of health to support a national contract with the efs 
blood center economics in certain european countries  including germany and the united kingdom  may require that we develop disposable kit configurations of the platelet system that treat larger volumes of platelets  which would serve to reduce the absolute number of kits we might sell to address market demand in those countries  even though our selling price and margin might be higher on such disposable kit configurations 
the japanese red cross controls a significant majority of blood transfusions in japan 
if approvals are not obtained to market our products in these countries  or if the products are not adopted in these countries  our potential product revenue will be significantly decreased 
our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
our products under development  and anticipated future products  are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by local  state and federal regulatory authorities in the united states and by foreign regulatory bodies 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market clearance or approval  sales and distribution  use standards and documentation  
table of contents post launch surveillance  quality  advertising and promotion  and reimbursement 
the fda and other agencies in the united states and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the manufacturing and marketing of products such as those we are developing 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is long  expensive and uncertain  and typically takes a number of years  depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
in addition  we may be required to obtain approval from the food and drug branch of the california state department of health for any product manufactured by us in california  including clinical trial use 
we may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses  or we may not be successful at all 
before the fda determines whether to approve the intercept blood system products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac 
bpac would then make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 
even if bpac were to recommend approval of one or more of our products  the fda would not necessarily approve those products 
if bpac were to recommend against approval of one or more of our products  it is likely that the fda would not approve those products 
if our product candidates receive approval for commercial sale  their marketing and manufacturing will be subject to continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  such as requirements to comply with good manufacturing practice and iso  a quality management system standard applicable to the products we sell in europe 
the failure to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis could result in delaying or precluding commercialization efforts in certain geographies  including the united states  and could result in enforcement action  which could harm our business 
the current manufacturing sites we rely upon for producing the platelet and plasma system products for european distribution are not fda qualified facilities 
regulatory authorities may also require post marketing testing  which can involve significant expense 
governments or regulatory authorities may impose new regulations or other changes or we may discover that we are subject to additional regulations that could further delay or preclude regulatory approval and subsequent adoption of our potential products 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action 
distribution of our products outside the united states also is subject to extensive government regulation 
these regulations vary by country  including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market  the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations 
in some countries  we may be required to register as a medical device manufacturer  even though we outsource manufacturing to third parties 
in addition  countries outside the european union may require clinical data submissions  registration packages  import licenses or other documentation with which we have no familiarity 
we were required to obtain a ce mark extension in our name from european union regulators for our platelet system  originally obtained by baxter in  by may and will need to do so every five years thereafter 
in addition to european union level approval  we must obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in some individual european countries  including france and switzerland  to market our products 
we may also be required to conduct additional testing in order to obtain regulatory approval in countries that do not recognize the ce mark as being adequate for commercializing the intercept blood system in those countries 
the level of additional product testing varies by country  but could be expensive or take a long time to complete 
failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in lost product revenue and profitability 
we have conducted many toxicology studies to demonstrate the intercept platelet and plasma systems safety  and we have conducted and plan to conduct toxicology studies for the intercept red blood cell system 
table of contents throughout the product development process 
at any time  the fda and other regulatory authorities may require further toxicology or other studies to further demonstrate our products safety  which could delay commercialization 
in addition  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may alter guidance at any time as to what constitutes acceptable clinical trial endpoints or trial design  which may necessitate our having to redesign our product candidates or proposed clinical trials and cause us to incur substantial additional expense or time in attempting to gain regulatory approval 
we believe the fda and other regulatory authorities are likely to weigh the potential risks of using our pathogen inactivation products against the incremental benefits  which may be less compelling in light of improved safety in the blood supply 
we expect the fda to require us to demonstrate a very low level of potential side effects in data from commercial use or in additional phase iii trials of the platelet system we may conduct in the united states 
trials of this type may be too large and expensive to be practical 
regulatory delays can also materially impact our product development costs 
if we experience delays in testing or approvals  our product development costs will increase 
for example  we may need to repeat clinical trials to address regulatory or clinical questions 
we may also need to retain third party investigators and organizations in an attempt to facilitate regulatory review and approval 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed  and our ability to become profitable will be delayed 
regulatory agencies may limit the uses  or indications  for which any of our products are approved 
for example  we believe that the intercept blood system products will be able to claim the inactivation of particular pathogens only to the extent we have laboratory or animal data to support such claims 
after regulatory approval for the initial indications  further studies may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and to our products  there are regulatory requirements applicable to our prospective customers of intercept blood system products  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
blood centers and others will likely be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda or european regulatory authorities before making available blood products processed with our pathogen inactivation systems to hospitals and transfusing physicians 
for example  our customers in germany must obtain separate regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell blood components treated with the intercept blood system 
our customers may lack the resources or capability to obtain such regulatory approvals 
these requirements or regulators delays in approving license supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
blood centers that do submit applications for manufacturing and sale or supplements may face disapproval or delays in approval that could provide further delay or deter them from using our products 
the regulatory impact on potential customers could slow or limit the potential sales of our products 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
except for the intercept platelet and plasma systems  which have received ce mark approval and in country regulatory approvals in certain countries in europe  we have no products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale and are being marketed 
our product candidates are in various stages of development  and we face the risks of failure inherent in developing medical devices and biotechnology products based on new technologies 
our product candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy and we must adhere to quality standards regarding manufacturing and customer facing business processes before the fda and international regulatory authorities can approve them for commercial use 
we must provide the fda and international regulatory authorities with preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data demonstrating that our products are safe  effective and in compliance with government regulations before the products can be approved for commercial sale 

table of contents in  the platelet system received ce mark approval 
we will need to complete validation studies and obtain in country regulatory approvals and gain national reimbursement in certain european countries before we can market our products in those countries 
we expect that lengthy randomized clinical trials funded by a third party will need to be completed prior to our marketing our platelet system in the netherlands 
we also expect to conduct many smaller scale experience studies at our expense with prospective customers in a number of european countries 
we completed our phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and have submitted data from this trial  along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  to the fda 
based on discussions with the fda  we performed an additional blinded analysis of the clinical trial data  under the direction of an independent expert physician panel  to determine if apparent differences between treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events reported in the study were attributable to inconsistent event reporting 
the reassessment of primary patient records by the expert physician panel showed no statistically significant differences between groups 
this reassessment differed from the earlier analysis of adverse events that was based on clinical trial case report forms  which showed statistically significant differences in specific pulmonary events 
we submitted a report of the analysis to the fda for review 
the report included conclusions from the expert physician panel 
based upon further discussions with the fda following submission of that report  we continue to expect that the fda will require an additional  significantly larger phase iii clinical trial to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy and safety of the platelet system  using the company s final commercial product design  as compared to conventional platelets 
we also understand that our reassessment of our previously completed phase iii clinical trial data will not be sufficient to address the apparent differences observed in that trial between the treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events 
we have had several interactions with the fda subsequent to the final report submission and understand that the fda may consider non randomized data derived from commercial use of the platelet system in europe in conjunction with previously completed phase iii data from randomized clinical trials conducted in the united states 
such data from commercial use will need to be in a form and substance deemed acceptable to the fda in its sole discretion 
there is no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with the fda on the data to be collected  that we will be able to collect such data  or that the fda will find such data from commercial use adequate to answer questions that the fda has concerning the safety and efficacy of the platelet system 
as a result  the fda may still require a significantly larger randomized  blinded clinical trial than we and baxter completed in before a product license application can be finalized and the platelet system considered for approval in the united states 
such an additional phase iii trial would have to be designed to demonstrate no greater frequency in the incidence of such adverse events relative to a control group on a statistically significant basis 
the dimensions of such a phase iii trial may be prohibitively large due either to prospective cost  logistics or both 
the additional phase iii clinical trial would need to be completed and data from the trial submitted to the fda before we could complete our regulatory submission 
before we begin gathering data from commercial use in europe or an additional clinical trial  we will need to gain concurrence with the fda on our trial design 
we may not be able to reach concurrence on the size  scope or design of the study or we may conclude that the cost of such a study is unacceptable or logistically unachievable 
the fda may not find the data from any additional clinical trials or from commercial use in europe to be acceptable for approval in the united states 
in the united states  studies related to the platelet system disposable and compound manufacturing also need to be completed and included in fda submissions before the fda would consider the applications for approval 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system  in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we obtained a ce mark approval in europe of the plasma system in november and final french approval in may we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states or any other regions other than europe 
in some countries  including several in europe  we or our customers may be required to perform additional clinical studies or submit manufacturing and marketing applications in order to obtain regulatory approval 

table of contents as a result of the termination of phase iii clinical trials of our red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to red blood cells treated with the intercept red blood cell system in one patient in the chronic arm of the trials  we have been conducting additional research activities on our red blood cell system to determine if the system can be reconfigured to reduce the potential for antibody reactivity to treated red blood cells 
based upon an internal evaluation of the results to date from these additional research activities and after consulting with regulatory authorities  we initiated a new phase i trial in in the united states using a modified red blood cell system before potentially progressing to later stage clinical trials 
we utilized a manual processing system in the phase i trial  which system is not in a commercially feasible form 
results of the phase i trial suggest that the modified process in combination with a conventional additive solution results in conditions not suitable for long term storage of red blood cells treated with the intercept system  adversely impacting their lifespan 
consequently  we are conducting in vitro and in vivo studies and plan to begin a new phase i clinical trial in the second half of to test further modifications to the red blood cell system 
a number of trial design  process and product design issues that could impact efficacy  regulatory approval and market acceptance will need to be resolved prior to the initiation of further clinical trials and while those clinical trials are being conducted  including determining the appropriate design of additional phase i or subsequent phase ii clinical trials  if deemed necessary  and phase iii clinical trials  and developing a commercially feasible red blood cell system  including disposables  hardware and software for implementing the process in blood collection centers 
these development initiatives may be costly and time consuming 
even if the project proceeds on course  we would not expect to initiate a phase iii trial for our red blood cell system for approximately two years 
a delay in completing such activities could result in a delay in the timely progression to later stage trials 
if we are unsuccessful in advancing a modified red blood cell system through clinical trials  resolving process and product design issues or in obtaining subsequent regulatory approvals and acceptable reimbursement rates  we may never realize a return on our development expenses incurred to date in the red blood cell system program 
clinical trials in particular are expensive and have a high risk of failure 
any of our product candidates may fail in the testing phase or may not achieve results sufficient to attain market acceptance  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
we do not know whether we will begin and conduct planned clinical trials on schedule  if at all 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our clinical trials 
we also do not know whether planned clinical trials will need to be revamped or will be completed on schedule  if at all 
criteria for regulatory approval in blood safety indications are evolving with competitive advances in the standard of care against which new product candidates are judged  as well as with changing market needs and reimbursement levels 
clinical trial design  including enrollment criteria  endpoints  and anticipated label claims are thus subject to change  even if original objectives are being met 
in addition to the reasons stated above  clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective clinical site and delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study 
we do not know whether any clinical trials will result in marketable products 
typically  there is a high rate of failure for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials and product candidates emerging from any successful trials would not reach the market for several years 
it may take us several years to complete our clinical testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
enrollment criteria for certain of our clinical trials may be quite narrow 
consequently  we may be unable to recruit suitable patients into the trial on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot rely on interim results of trials to predict their final results  and acceptable results in early trials might not be repeated in later trials 
any trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
in addition  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated  require other studies to be performed or cause a program to be terminated  even if other studies or trials relating to a program are successful 

table of contents we have very limited experience in marketing and sales  or in managing a commercial operation in europe 
we have limited experience in managing regulatory affairs  particularly with foreign authorities 
following our agreements with baxter in february  we became fully responsible for sales  marketing and distribution support of the intercept blood system worldwide  except in those asian territories covered by our agreements with bioone for the platelet and plasma systems 
as a consequence  we no longer rely upon baxter or fenwal for sales  marketing  distribution  or regulatory support of the intercept blood system 
if we fail in our efforts to develop such internal competencies or establish acceptable relationships with third parties on a timely basis  our attempts to commercialize the intercept blood system may be irreparably harmed 
we must develop  build and manage marketing  sales  distribution  customer service and back office functions necessary to support commercialization of the intercept blood system in europe 
historically  we had a small scientific affairs group that helped support baxter s european sales and marketing organization  however  we did not maintain our own independent sales and marketing organization 
we may be unable to maintain existing customer relationships established by baxter or fenwal as we take on responsibility for sales  marketing and customer service 
beginning in early  we began to recruit a small organization headquartered in the netherlands dedicated primarily to selling and marketing the platelet and plasma systems in geographies where it is approved 
we may be unable to recruit suitable sales  marketing  and supporting personnel on a timely basis  if at all  or retain such personnel thereafter 
in addition to adding sales and marketing capabilities  we have needed to develop appropriate inventory and logistics management  receivables and collections  foreign exchange  risk management  human resources  information  local regulatory  and quality systems capabilities 
generally  such capabilities must be built in compliance with eu and local standards and practices  with which we have little experience 
we also have had to develop customer service capabilities to insure uninterrupted supply of platelet and plasma system disposable kits  timely calibration and servicing of uva illuminators  and appropriate and timely resolution of customer complaints 
we may be unable to operate a european organization effectively and efficiently  even after cerus europe bv is fully staffed 
developing sales  marketing and operational capabilities ourselves will increase our costs and the rate of cash consumption and may delay commercialization of our pathogen inactivation systems 
we rely on third parties to market  sell and distribute our pathogen inactivation products and to maintain customer relationships in a number of foreign countries 
we have entered into contracts  generally on a geographically exclusive basis  with distributors in countries where we have limited abilities to commercialize our pathogen inactivation products directly 
we have entered into national distribution agreements in spain and portugal  turkey  russia  poland  greece  kuwait  saudi arabia  and malaysia  as well as regional distribution agreements in italy 
we rely on these distributors to market and sell the intercept blood system  provide customer support  maintain inventories  and adhere to our quality system in all material respects  among other activities 
while our contracts generally require distributors to exercise diligence  these distributors may fail to commercialize the intercept blood systems in their respective territories or may do so on terms that are not economic to us 
they may fail to sell product inventory they have purchased from us to end customers 
they may irreparably harm relationships with local existing and prospective customers and our standing with the blood banking community in general 
we may have little recourse  short of termination  in the event that a distributor fails to execute according to our expectations 
we must develop regulatory capabilities for clinical stage and phase iv trials involving the intercept blood system globally 
failure to develop such regulatory capabilities may slow the rate of adoption of the platelet and plasma systems 
we need additional resources to support regulatory activities and post approval trials relating to these products 
we may not have adequate internal resources and capabilities to manage phase iv and post approval trials and to respond appropriately to possible customer complaints or required regulatory reporting of adverse 
table of contents events arising from the use of the platelet system 
we will need to increase our regulatory and trial management resources or contract with independent regulatory consultants  which we may be unable to do on a timely basis 
adding regulatory and trial management resources will result in increased costs and may potentially delay regulatory filings 
delays or inabilities to complete regulatory filings and obtain approvals will also delay or prevent us from being able to recognize sales of our products and attaining profitability 
we will continue to rely on fenwal for manufacturing and supplying components of our platelet and plasma systems for a limited period of time 
over a longer period  we will need to identify  select and qualify third party sources of supply for the intercept blood system  including the intercept red blood cell system 
we are dependent on fenwal to manufacture the platelet and plasma systems through the end of and certain components of the two systems through the end of  subject to extension under specified conditions  but have not yet established a source of supply for the intercept blood system for and beyond 
in march baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company  fenwal inc we have been informed by baxter that fenwal has assumed baxter s obligations to us under the manufacturing agreement 
however  fenwal may fail to manufacture an adequate supply of components  intersol additive solution or devices of the intercept blood system or to do so on a cost effective basis  which would subject us to the risks described above 
certain components of the intercept blood system are currently manufactured or assembled at facilities not owned by fenwal 
under our agreements  fenwal will continue to be obligated to supply illuminators and disposable kits associated with the platelet and plasma systems to us generally through and for certain components through failure to produce an adequate supply of components or devices of the intercept blood system would subject us to the risks described above 
in addition  because the components of the intercept blood system are manufactured and assembled at multiple facilities owned by both fenwal and baxter leading up to final assembly  fenwal and baxter will remain interdependent with respect to the intercept blood system supply chain 
fenwal and baxter may fail to coordinate or meet interdependent supply chain obligations  leading to a failure to manufacture an adequate supply of components or devices of the intercept blood system  which would also subject us to the risks described below 
while we have had discussions with fenwal and third parties  we have not successfully concluded negotiations to assure an uninterrupted supply of the intercept blood system beyond the expiration of the current supply agreement with fenwal 
failure to do so would lead to material adverse events  including loss of contracts  customer relationships and our ability to operate as a going concern 
fenwal manufactures our platelet and plasma systems in facilities that are not fda approved 
our agreements do not require fenwal to validate these manufacturing facilities with the fda 
in order to be sold in the united states  our systems would be required to be manufactured in an fda approved facility 
fda validation of a manufacturing facility  whether owned by fenwal or by another party  will be costly and time consuming 
we rely on third parties for manufacturing and supplying components of our platelet and plasma systems 
we will also be dependent on baxter and fenwal to transfer know how relevant to the intercept blood system  however  certain of fenwal s materials  manufacturing processes and methods are proprietary to fenwal or baxter 
we may be unable to establish alternate sources of supply to fenwal without having to redesign certain elements of the platelet and plasma systems 
such redesign may be costly  time consuming and require further regulatory review  which would delay our ability to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems 
fenwal is not obligated to provide support for development and testing of improvements or changes we may make to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to identify  select  and qualify such manufacturers or those third parties able to provide support for development and testing activities on a timely basis or enter into contracts with them on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we conclude that supply of the intercept blood system or components from fenwal is uncertain  we may choose to build inventories of raw materials or work in process 
table of contents components  which would consume capital resources and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient 
we have recently contracted directly with third party suppliers of certain components to the platelet and plasma systems which fenwal had used historically in an effort to make the supply of components more reliable  though doing so will increase our investment in raw material and work in process inventory and subject us to minimum purchase requirements in suppliers of these components may not meet quality specifications we have set  which would cause a disruption in supply and may lead to lost sales and irreparable damage to our customer relationships 
moreover  the inclusion of components manufactured by new suppliers could require us to seek new or updated approvals from regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not receive any such required regulatory approvals 
our potential remedies against fenwal and baxter or other manufacturers may be inadequate in assuring that fenwal and baxter meet their contractual obligations 
in the event of a failure by fenwal  baxter or other manufacturers to perform their obligations to supply components of the intercept blood system to us  damages recoverable by us may be insufficient to compensate us for the full loss of business opportunity 
our supply agreement with baxter  assumed by fenwal  and other supply agreements contain limitations on incidental and consequential damages that we may recover 
a supplier s potential liability in the event of non performance may not be sufficient to compel the supplier to continue to act in conformity with our agreements 
the platelet system is not compatible with some commercial platelet collection methods and platforms and platelet storage solutions 
the equipment and materials used to collect platelets vary by manufacturer and by geographic region 
platelets may be collected from a single donor by apheresis using an automated collection machine 
apheresis devices currently used in the united states and european markets differ  among other characteristics  in their ability to collect platelets in reduced volumes of plasma 
platelet concentrates may also be prepared from whole blood by pooling together platelets from multiple donors 
there are two commonly used methods for preparing whole blood platelets the buffy coat method  which is used extensively in europe and canada  and the pooled random donor method  which is used in the united states and to a more limited extent in europe 
our system for platelets is designed to work with platelets collected using a proprietary platelet storage solution  called intersol  manufactured by fenwal 
for platelets collected by apheresis  the intercept platelet system is most compatible with fenwal s apheresis platelet collection system  because it facilitates the use of intersol 
for platelets prepared from whole blood  our platelet system is most compatible with the buffy coat collection method  again because this method facilitates the use of intersol as an additive solution to the platelet concentrate 
as a result  we have conducted most of our clinical studies using either baxter s equipment or buffy coat platelets 
more recently  we have begun conducting studies in europe supporting the use of the platelet system in combination with other collection and preparation platforms 
fenwal may be required to obtain separate regulatory approval for intersol in the united states and in countries which do not recognize ce mark approval before we would be allowed to sell intersol to customers of the intercept blood system in those countries 
in order to address the entire market in the united states  we would need to develop and test additional configurations of the intercept platelet system 
our efforts to develop the platelet system were initially focused on apheresis platelets collected on fenwal s automated collection platform 
we estimate that the majority of platelets used in the united states are collected by apheresis  though a significant minority is prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections 
we have made our systems compatible with prevalent commercial platelet collection methods in order to address markets in europe  russia and the middle east  where we have begun to commercialize the intercept blood system 
in order to gain regulatory approval in certain geographies for a platelet pathogen inactivation system compatible with random donor platelets  we will need to perform additional product development and testing  including additional clinical trials 
these development activities would increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 

table of contents fenwal has committed to us to make intersol collection and pooling products and conversion kits available to customers 
however  fenwal may not make such products or its apheresis collection system available for sale in certain countries and has elected to discontinue sales efforts for its apheresis collection system in japan 
other manufacturers supplying blood component collection platforms to the market may resist our efforts to make the intercept blood system compatible with their platforms 
making our platelet system readily compatible with the apheresis collection system manufactured by haemonetics corp  a supplier of automated blood collection systems will require certain changes in the haemonetics device  and there can be no assurance that haemonetics will undertake this effort on a timely basis or in a commercially reasonable form 
gambro  inc  or gambro  another major supplier of automated platelet collection systems  received a ce mark of its own system for pathogen inactivation of platelets in late for competitive reasons  gambro may have little or no incentive to make its apheresis collection system compatible with our platelet system 
attaining compatibility with collection platforms manufactured by others may require adaptations to either the intercept blood system or to the collection platforms  which may be difficult to engineer  expensive to implement and test  require additional clinical trials  cause delays in regulatory approval and or be commercially unattractive to pursue 
these development activities will increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
market acceptance of the intercept blood system may be delayed until the system receives regulatory approval for use on such other equipment  if required 
because the intercept blood system products have not been manufactured on more than a limited commercial scale  we face manufacturing uncertainties that could limit their commercialization 
if our third party manufacturers fail to produce our products or compounds satisfactorily  at acceptable cost and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations 
the intercept blood system products  including many of the components  have been manufactured on a commercial scale on only a limited basis 
fenwal relies on third parties  including baxter  to manufacture and assemble some of the platelet and plasma system components  many of which are customized and have not been manufactured on a commercial scale 
fenwal has produced some pathogen inactivation systems in modest commercial quantities  but may not be able to manufacture and assemble other systems or in larger quantities  or do so economically 
because of low sales volumes and other reasons  fenwal s costs to manufacture commercial components for the platelet and plasma systems have been greater than we previously anticipated and may continue to rise 
it is uncertain what effect fenwal s independence from baxter will have on its cost structure or on transfer prices from baxter to fenwal and costs ultimately passed on to us 
these issues may result in reducing our potential gross profit margin from platelet and plasma system sales 
we are in the initial stages of commercializing the intercept blood system and may not accurately forecast demand for the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to contract with third parties to supply adequate numbers of platelet and plasma systems and components to meet demand and  as a result  supply to our customers may be interrupted 
if fenwal or third party manufacturers fail to produce our products or intersol products satisfactorily  at acceptable costs and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations 
fenwal and we purchase certain key components of the intercept blood system from a limited number of suppliers 
contracts for the long term supply of certain components have not yet been signed 
it would be expensive and time consuming to establish additional or replacement suppliers for these components 
some components of the intercept blood system  including components of the uva illuminator device  are no longer manufactured  which will require fenwal or us to identify and qualify replacement components and may require that we conduct additional studies  which could include clinical trials  to demonstrate equivalency or validate any required design or component changes 
if fenwal or we are unable to identify and supply replacement components  we may be unable to supply products to our customers 
if we were required to redesign the products  our development costs would increase  and our programs and commercialization efforts could be delayed significantly 

table of contents we intend to use third party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of the chemical compounds to be used in our products 
these compounds have not yet been produced in quantities sufficient to support commercialization for all regions in which we may market our products 
we have an agreement with a manufacturer to produce commercial quantities of amotosalen  a proprietary compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
we currently do not have any third party manufacturing agreements in place for commercial production of compounds used in our red blood cell system 
any new or additional commercial manufacturer will need to develop new methods and processes to manufacture these compounds on a commercial scale and demonstrate to us  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities that its commercial scale manufacturing processes comply with government regulations and that its compounds are equivalent to originally licensed compounds in order for us to maintain commercial licensure of our products 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture our products on a commercial scale 
our platelet and plasma systems have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
certain existing inventory has a shorter labeled shelf life 
we and our distributors may be unable to ship product to customers out of our inventory prior to the expiration of product shelf life  which would require that we destroy or consume the outdated inventory in product demonstration activities at our expense 
we have used prototype components in our preclinical studies and clinical trials of the intercept red blood cell system and have not completed the components commercial design 
we will be required to identify and enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture the red blood cell system and related blood component storage solutions 
the system disposables and instruments of our red blood cell system that we used in our preclinical studies and clinical trials in the united states historically and those we are now planning to use in an upcoming phase i red blood cell trial are prototypes of systems to be used in the final products 
as a result  we expect regulatory authorities will require us to perform additional preclinical and clinical studies using the commercial versions of the systems to demonstrate the acceptability of the commercial configuration and the equivalence of the prototypes and the commercial products design  which may increase our expenses and delay the commercialization of our products 
we are testing additional modifications of the red blood cell system to improve the lifespan of treated red blood cells 
in vitro and in vivo studies of such modifications to the red blood cell system may not be indicative of red blood cell lifespan in humans 
additional early stage trials will be necessary to determine whether our modifications  including these new approaches  may lead to a product candidate with acceptable commercial characteristics 
we also intend to assess whether such modifications would be acceptable clinically  economically and or operationally to potential customers 
we may determine that although the modified red blood cell system may overcome technical issues encountered in the past  it may not be commercially feasible from potential customers perspectives 
if we fail to develop commercial versions of the intercept red blood cell system on schedule  our potential revenue would be delayed or diminished and our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  the design and engineering effort required to complete the final commercial product is substantial and time consuming 
as with any complex development effort  we expect to encounter design  engineering and manufacturing issues 
such issues have previously arisen  sometimes unexpectedly  and solutions to these issues have not always been readily forthcoming 
additional unforeseen design  engineering and manufacturing issues may arise in the future  which could increase the development cost and delay commercialization of our products 
except for very limited manufacturing of disposable components  fenwal is not obligated to provide manufacturing services related to the red blood cell system 
we will need to identify parties to provide those manufacturing services related to our red blood cell system 
it may be difficult to enter into these types of agreements on reasonable terms 
in particular  it will be time consuming for other manufacturers to develop the capability to manufacture the intercept blood system products and blood component storage solutions economically and to gain regulatory approval to do so for commercial use 
we may be unable to identify and contract with manufacturers that can make our products cost effectively  which would delay our efforts to commercialize the red blood cell system  even if we successfully complete clinical development 

table of contents we rely on bioone for commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in many asian countries 
baxter and we have licensed to bioone rights to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  vietnam  thailand  and singapore 
bioone is solely responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals  marketing and selling the platelet and plasma systems in those countries 
we understand fenwal has assumed the rights and obligations of baxter with regard to baxter s agreements with bioone 
bioone is dependent on fenwal for the manufacture and supply of the platelet and plasma systems 
we understand that fenwal has not maintained baxter s ce mark registration for the platelet system after it expired in mid  however  fenwal may choose to apply for ce marks for the platelet and plasma systems under its own label 
if fenwal elects not to obtain such ce marks  bioone will be required to obtain regulatory approval or import licenses on its own in countries within its licensed territory 
bioone may be unable to qualify the platelet and plasma systems for sale in certain countries in its territory in the absence of ce marks being held by fenwal  even if ce marks are held by us 
bioone has made little progress to date in commercializing the platelet and plasma systems in asian territories 
because we only have a minority investment interest in bioone  we lack the ability to significantly influence bioone  and are dependent on bioone s performance to realize milestone and royalty revenue from commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in those countries 
in japan  regulatory authorities may require our platelet and plasma systems to be widely adopted commercially in europe or approved by the fda before the platelet and plasma systems are considered for approval in japan  which would delay or prevent bioone from achieving significant product revenue 
in july  bioone raised limited additional capital in order to fund curtailed operations 
at these reduced operating levels  bioone s abilities to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in its asian territories will be compromised 
there is no assurance that bioone will be able to attract additional required capital in the future to successfully commercialize those products licensed from fenwal and us 
if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
if competitors encounter difficulties or failures in human clinical trials or in commercial settings  we may face additional clinical  regulatory  and commercial challenges 
we expect our products to encounter significant competition 
the intercept blood system products may compete with other approaches to blood safety currently in use  as well as with future products that may be developed by others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes brought about by the development and introduction of new products 
product development is risky and uncertain  and we cannot assure you that we will develop our products successfully 
competitors products or technologies may make our products obsolete or non competitive before we are able to generate any significant revenue 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
they may also have greater experience in preclinical testing  human clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures 
several companies are developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for products that will directly compete with or reduce the market for our pathogen inactivation systems 
a number of companies are specifically focusing on alternative strategies for pathogen inactivation in platelets and plasma 
in europe  several companies  including grifols sa  octapharma ag and macopharma international gmbh  are developing or selling commercial pathogen inactivation systems or services to treat fresh frozen plasma 
navigant biotechnologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of gambro group  is developing a pathogen inactivation system for blood products and has been issued a ce mark for a pathogen reduction system for platelets 
new methods of testing whole blood for specific pathogens have been approved by the fda and in europe  as have tests for bacteria in platelets 
continued delays in commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in france and germany may impact our ability to compete with bacterial testing for platelets 
tests have recently 
table of contents been approved to detect west nile virus in blood products 
other groups are developing rapid  point of care bacterial tests  synthetic blood product substitutes and products to stimulate the growth of platelets 
development and commercialization of any of these or other related technologies could limit the potential market for our products 
we may be liable and we may need to withdraw our products from the market if our products harm people 
we may be liable if an accident occurs in our controlled use of hazardous materials 
we are exposed to potential liability risks inherent in the testing and marketing of medical devices and pharmaceutical products 
we may be liable if any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we will have completed rigorous preclinical and clinical safety testing prior to marketing our products  there may be harmful effects caused by our products that we are unable to identify in preclinical or clinical testing 
in particular  unforeseen  rare reactions or adverse side effects related to long term use of our products may not be observed until the products are in widespread commercial use 
because of the limited duration and number of patients receiving blood components treated with the intercept blood system products in clinical trials  it is possible that harmful effects of our products not observed in clinical and preclinical testing could be discovered after a marketing approval has been received 
later discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in additional restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are subject to risks and costs of product recall  which include not only potential out of pocket costs  but also potential interruption to our supply chain 
in such an event  our customer relations would be harmed and we would incur unforeseen losses 
we maintain product liability insurance  but do not know whether the insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  radioactive materials and infectious pathogens  such as hiv and hepatitis viruses 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are adequate and comply with regulatory requirements  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from a single site that may be subject to lengthy business interruption in the event of a severe earthquake 
we also may suffer loss of computerized information and may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from our facilities in concord  california  which are within an active earthquake fault zone 
should a severe earthquake occur  we might be unable to occupy our facilities or conduct research and development and general and administrative activities in support of our business and products until such time as our facilities could be repaired and made operational 
our property and casualty and business interruption insurance in general does not cover losses caused by earthquakes 
while we have taken certain measures to protect our scientific  technological and commercial assets  a lengthy or costly disruption due to an earthquake would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have also taken measures to limit damage that may occur from the loss of computerized data due to power outage  system or component failure  or corruption of data files 
however  we may lose critical computerized data  which may be difficult or impossible to recreate  which may harm our business 
we may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems  which may subject us to fines or adverse consequences  up to and including loss of our abilities to conduct business 

table of contents we have only a limited operating history  and we expect to continue to generate losses 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
to date  we have engaged primarily in research and development 
our development and selling  general  and administrative expenses have resulted in substantial losses each year since our inception with the exception of the year ended december  in  we realized a million nonrecurring gain associated with the restructuring of a loan payable in and  as a result of this gain  we recorded net income of million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the platelet and plasma systems  we have not received significant revenue from product revenue 
the platelet and plasma systems are not yet approved in the united states or in many other countries around the world 
the red blood cell system is in early stage clinical development and may never emerge from the clinical development stage as a marketed product 
we may be required to reduce the sales price for our products in order to make our products economically attractive to our customers and to governmental and private payors  which would reduce and may eliminate our gross profit on sales 
pricing levels may differ widely from country to country  depending on economic  social and industry practices specific to each country 
at our present low unit sales levels of the platelet and plasma systems  our costs to manufacture  distribute  market  sell  support and administer the systems are in excess of revenue 
we may be unable to increase sales to a level sufficient to generate profit contribution 
because the contracts with large  public sector customers  such as the efs  for the intercept blood system may not be confidential due to the public tender process  their terms may set contractual precedents that would not be acceptable to us if applied to contracts with our other customers 
historically  we received substantially all of our revenue from our agreements with our development partners and from federal research grants and cooperative agreements and were required to conduct significant research  development  clinical testing and regulatory compliance activities for each of these products 
only in the most recent year ended december   has our product sales revenue exceeded revenue from our agreements with our development partners and from federal research grants and cooperative agreements 
contribution from product sales is unlikely to exceed the costs we incur in research  development  and commercialization of the intercept blood system for the foreseeable future 
we expect our losses to continue at least until the intercept blood system is commercialized more broadly and achieves more significant market acceptance 
costs of developing and testing the red blood cell system in later stage human clinical trials will extend the period during which we expect to operate at a loss 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our future operations  we will not be able to develop product candidates in our pipeline 
our product development programs and product commercialization efforts are capital intensive 
we may need to reduce or stop further investment in specific research and development or sales and marketing activities if we are unable to obtain additional capital or if any of our development programs are determined by us to be economically unfeasible 
a product or program may be determined to be uneconomic if the commercial opportunity is insufficient to justify the investment required to develop and market the product or for other reasons 
we expect that our spending in support of research  development and commercialization of the platelet  plasma  and red blood cell systems will be in excess of contribution from product sales and development funding for such programs from third parties over the next year 
we may experience higher than anticipated working capital requirements  particularly if we are unable to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis or choose to maintain safety stocks of inventory of the platelet and plasma systems to mitigate risks of supply shortages 
as a result of these factors  further product development and commercialization of the intercept blood system may take longer and be more expensive than we previously anticipated 
we expect to continue to expend substantial funds in support of our operations for the foreseeable future 
our cash  liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the development progress and costs of our programs  payments from collaborators  funding from agencies of the united states government  costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property position  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our product candidates  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
through december   we had been awarded million in funding under cooperative agreements with the department of defense  and have received million in proceeds from these awards 
we also 
table of contents received funding under grants from the national institutes of health  largely in support of the immunotherapy business that we spun off in late further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood systems will decline significantly when compared to historic levels 
it is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the us congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount of government funding 
additionally  we no longer are deemed to be a small business for purposes of being eligible for certain grants administered by the national institutes of health and regulated by small business administration 
historically  a significant portion of our grant revenue came from awards surrounding our former immunotherapy business 
we anticipate that all grants and awards surrounding our immunotherapy business will be transferred to anza  and as a result  we will no longer be eligible to receive proceeds from these awards 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for future blood safety activities at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
in addition  we are required separately to administer and account for our work under government contracts and grants on an on going basis as a condition to accepting government funding which places administrative  accounting and reporting burdens on us beyond those we have assumed as a public company 
if we fail to comply with applicable governmental administrative  accounting and reporting regulations with respect to these grants and cooperative agreements  funds currently available to us may be reduced or lost 
these conditions may also result in increased selling  general  and administrative spending beyond what we have experienced 
we may receive no economic benefit from the spin off of our immunotherapy business 
in november  we spun off our immunotherapy business to anza therapeutics  inc in exchange for contributed tangible and intangible assets  we received an equity interest of approximately of anza s fully diluted equity  including shares currently held in escrow which we expect to receive 
in addition to equity  we are eligible to receive future cash milestone payments of up to in excess of million  as well as royalty payments  if vaccine candidates generated from the transferred assets are successfully developed and commercialized 
there is no assurance that the equity will have monetary value at such time we are allowed to sell it or that any of the milestone or royalty payments will ever be made to us 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending our products against third party challenges 
our technology will be protected from unauthorized use only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets 
as a result  our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain that our patents or patents that we license from others will be enforceable and afford protection against competitors 
our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
others may independently develop technologies similar to ours or independently duplicate our technologies 
for example  a united states patent issued to a third party covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products 
we have reviewed the patent and believe there exist substantial questions concerning its validity 
we cannot be certain  however  that a court would hold the patent to be invalid or not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems  if and when those product are sold in the 
table of contents united states 
our key blood safety patents generally expire at various dates between and recent patent applications will  if granted  result in patents with later expiration dates 
in addition  we have a license from fenwal under united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire from to due to the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of our potential products  our patents may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantage of the patents 
we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
we may need to license the right to use third party patents and intellectual property to continue development and commercialization of our products 
we may not be able to acquire such required licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents  or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we may face litigation to defend against claims of infringement  assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how or determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
patent litigation is costly 
in addition  we may require interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions relating to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings could be expensive and time consuming  and we could be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may rely  in certain circumstances  on trade secrets to protect our technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees and certain contractors 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
as our international operations grow  we may be subject to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and foreign currencies 
consequently  we may suffer losses 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  among other factors differing political  economic  and regulatory climates  different tax structures  and foreign exchange volatility 
we do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
as a result  our future results could be materially affected by changes in these or other factors 
product sales of our blood safety products are typically made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we incur operating expenses in euros and other foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of interest expense and other  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may materially affect our results of operations 
currently we do not have any near term plans to enter into a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility 
the market price of our stock may be highly volatile 
the market prices for our securities and those of other emerging medical device and biotechnology companies have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
for example  during the period from january   to december   the sale price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global market fluctuated within a range from a low of to a high of 
announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
such announcements may include decisions regarding reimbursement and commercial adoption by customers  national blood services or governmental bodies

the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and medical device companies  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may fail to comply fully with elements of the sarbanes oxley act of our failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of this act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants attesting to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
these requirements extend to the operations of our subsidiary in europe 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude in future periods that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we cannot favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of future results 
overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development  clinical testing and commercialization of blood safety systems and  from until late  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
with the exception of a non recurring gain recognized during the three months ended march   we have been generally unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the platelet and plasma systems  for which we have been issued ce marks  all of our product candidates are in the research and development stage 
to date  our primary source of revenue has been from milestone payments and development contracts and collaborative agreements and grants from us government agencies  including the us armed forces and the national institutes of health  or nih 
we have recognized modest european product revenues to date from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems 
we must conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our product candidates that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after our platelet and plasma systems gain widespread commercial acceptance in europe and the middle east 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our blood safety products 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
through december   in addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems  we have recognized revenue from commercialization agreements with bioone  as well as from grants and cooperative agreements from the armed forces 
as a result of selling our immunotherapy business to anza therapeutics  inc  revenue associated with grants and cooperative agreements with the nih is reported as a component of loss from discontinued operations for all years presented 
under the agreements with bioone  we have received milestone payments and may receive additional contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
prior to the year ended december   we had received a total of million in cash payments and million in equity securities from bioone as partial payment for licensed rights to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in certain countries in asia 
in  we reduced the carrying value of our equity in bioone to million  reflecting the current fair value based on a financing round bioone completed with third party investors 
effective february   we entered into a new agreement with baxter related to the intercept blood system 
under terms of the february agreement  we gained worldwide rights to the intercept platelet and plasma systems previously held by baxter  excluding certain asian countries covered in agreements with bioone 
we previously acquired worldwide commercialization rights for the red blood cell system from baxter 
beginning in  we began paying baxter  and  as of march  fenwal royalties on product sales  with a rate of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system and for the red blood cell system 
this royalty structure replaced the terms of previous agreements with baxter under which we had received a defined share of gross profit from product sales 
under the terms of the february agreement  baxter agreed to supply certain transition services to us through at our expense  including regulatory  technical and back office support  and to conduct certain continued development efforts relating to the plasma system at its expense 
baxter also agreed to manufacture systems for the platelet and plasma systems on a cost plus basis through december   and components through december   and agreed to supply only very limited types of components for the prototype of the red blood cell system 
in march  we were informed that fenwal has assumed baxter s manufacturing obligations to us 

table of contents as a result of the february agreement with baxter  we recorded net gains and deferred gains in excess of million and also repaid the million promissory note plus accrued interest owed to baxter capital that had originally been due in december at december   we had recognized all of these gains and deferred gains 
under the terms of the february agreement  we are responsible for the commercialization and development of the platelet and plasma systems  except in parts of asia 
we expect that our spending over the next year in support of research  development and commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems will be in excess of the contribution from product sales to customers and from milestone payments and development funding for such programs from bioone  the armed forces and others 
we also anticipate increasing our expenditures in support of preclinical and clinical trials and device development of our red blood cell system 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collaborative arrangements  contract research and other contingencies  and non cash stock compensation assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue and research and development expenses revenue is recognized when i a written agreement exists  ii products and or services have been delivered  iii pricing is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
revenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each unit of accounting of an agreement 
for all intercept sales  we use a binding purchase order or signed sales contract as evidence of written agreement 
we sell intercept directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective product 
deliverables and the units of accounting vary according to the provisions of each customer agreement 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements we evaluate whether the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the undelivered elements is reliably determinable  and whether the delivery of the remaining elements is probable and within our control 
when all of these conditions are met  we recognize the revenue on the delivered elements 
if these conditions are not met  we defer revenue until such time as all of the conditions have been met or all of the elements have been delivered 
revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the projects are incurred 
revenue related to substantive at risk milestones specified under development contracts is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
to date  we have not received license fees or milestone payments that are refundable 
to the extent that they are subject to future performance criteria  we recognize revenue ratably over the estimated license or development period 
we have received up front payments from collaboration agreements 
these up front payments are deferred and recognized over the period where we estimate we are likely to have involvement 
we have also received equity in two privately held companies in addition to cash as consideration for licensed rights or technologies 
we evaluate several criteria to determine the fair value of the equity received and to conclude whether the facts and circumstances support a fair value for revenue recognition and the investment balance 
these criteria include  but are not limited to  third party investor 
table of contents interest and participation in recent equity offerings at current pricing  business outlook of the privately held company  and available financial information of the privately held company 
the financial information we receive is generally only available on an infrequent basis 
although management uses the best available information at the time  there can be no absolute assurance that facts and circumstances will not change in the future 
should these facts and circumstances change  they may negatively impact our consolidated financial statements 
we receive certain united states government grants and contracts that support our research effort in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
inventory we have work in progress inventory for certain components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illumination devices  and certain replacement parts for our illumination devices 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
our platelet and plasma system kits generally have a two year shelf life from the date of manufacture  though plasma system disposable kits manufactured prior to early generally have a one year life 
subsequent to december   the company received regulatory approval for two year life of its plasma system disposable kits 
illumination devices and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsaleable 
our limited history selling intercept limits the amount of historical data we have to perform such analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsaleable inventory using a number of factors including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  forecasts  and inventory turnover 
accrued expenses we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities and development services  including those related to clinical trials  preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies  as well as transition services and development activities being performed by third parties 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
specifically  accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial  pass through costs to clinical sites  contract research organization costs including fees  database development  and reporting costs  among others 
stock based compensation we issue stock based awards to our employees  board of directors  scientific advisory boards and certain contractors as strategic  long term incentives 
beginning in the first quarter of  we recorded stock based compensation expense for employee awards under fas r  accounting for stock based compensation fas r 
we have elected to use the modified prospective method of adoption 
under fas r  we record compensation expense to our income statement based on the grant date fair value of a stock award and expense the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we determine the grant date fair value of a stock award using the black scholes option pricing model 
we continue to apply the provisions of eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunctions with selling  goods or services eitf for our non employee stock based awards 
under eitf  the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock based award is measured is equal to the earlier of the date at which a commitment for performance by the counter party to earn the equity instrument is reached or the date at which the counter party s performance is complete 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of the vested portion of the non employee awards in our consolidated statements of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model calculates the grant date fair value using certain variables 
these variables are impacted by our stock price  award exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and our expected dividends and many of these variables require us to use significant judgment 
expected term 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using a variety of factors 
where possible  we estimate the expected term of options granted by analyzing employee exercise and post 
table of contents vesting termination behavior 
to make this estimation  we analyze the population of options granted by discreet homogeneous groups 
for those homogeneous groups where we are unable to obtain sufficient information to estimate the expected term in this manner  we estimate the expected term of the options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period 
estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the forfeiture rate of options at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we estimate the historic pre vesting forfeiture rates by groups that possess a degree of homogeneity regarding average time to vest and expected term 
estimated volatility 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using both historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility in market traded options in accordance with sab our decision to use both historical volatility and implied volatility was based upon the limited availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that due to the limited availability of actively traded options  historical volatility should be given greater prominence in our decision as we believe it is more representative of future stock price 
as such  we have calculated our estimated volatility by weighting both historical volatility and implied volatility 
we have used significant judgment in making these estimates and we will continue to monitor the availability of actively traded options on our common stock 
risk free interest rate 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
expected dividend 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if factors change and we utilize different assumptions in determining the grant date fair value of stock compensation expense in the future  or if we utilize a different option pricing model in the future  then those results may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially effect our operating results 
there is significant risk that the black scholes option pricing model and the judgment we have used in ascertaining the variables will yield results that differ materially from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  termination or forfeitures of the awards in the future 
historical results were utilized in deriving our variables  which may not be indicative of the future 
income taxes since our inception we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income 
we currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits 
timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions  economic environments in which we operate  and timing of regulatory approval of our products 
effective january   financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  became effective for us 
fin requires derecognition of tax positions that do not have a greater than likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
use of a valuation allowance as described in financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes fas is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position 
the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on us 
we continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets 
although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions  there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed 

table of contents results of operations years ended december    and in the following discussion of our results of operations  results related to the immunotherapy business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods discussed 
revenue years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change to change to product revenue government grant and cooperative agreements milestone and development funding milestone and development revenue from related party total revenue revenue was million in  million in  and million in for the year ended december   we recognized million of product revenue from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets and plasma  compared to million during the same period in the prior year  and million in the increase from was largely driven by an increase in unit sales of consumable kits and illuminators 
prior to the february agreements with baxter  product revenue represented our share of adjusted gross margins on platelet system sales 
subsequent to february   product revenue represents the sales from platelet and plasma systems 
the results may not be indicative of platelet and plasma system revenue in the future 
we anticipate product revenues for both the platelet and plasma systems will continue to increase in future periods as the intercept blood system gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway 
revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease was due primarily to the reduced awards from the armed forces for research activities for our intercept blood system programs 
revenue increased slightly by million to million for the year ended december   from million during the comparable period in primarily due to slightly increased development activities surrounding our blood safety awards with the armed forces 
we anticipate revenues from government grants to make up a declining percentage of our total revenues as we continue to gain market acceptance for the intercept blood system

milestone and development funding increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the increase is due to increased development activities for our intercept plasma product during in order to obtain ce mark approval 
we recognized no milestone and development funding from bioone  a related party  during the year ended december   down from million for the comparable period in when we received up front consideration from bioone in  it was initially deferred and was recognized ratably through in addition  during the year ended december   we received million in milestone funding from bioone as a result of our receipt of the ce mark approval for the plasma system

we have no further development obligations under our existing agreements with bioone 
we do not expect significant revenues to be generated from bioone until such time as bioone may successfully commercialize the products licensed from us  which we expect will be no earlier than  if ever 
milestone and development funding from bioone increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the increase was due to the receipt of million in milestone funding received from bioone as a result of our receipt of the ce mark approval for the plasma system 
cost of product revenue years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change to change to cost of product revenue cost of product revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in  and zero in the increase of million primarily resulted from increased unit sales of our intercept platelet and plasma system kits and illuminators in compared to in addition  beginning january   we paid royalties to baxter and then fenwal  equal to of net platelet system sales and of net plasma system sales 
we paid no royalties to baxter in or prior to the february agreement with baxter  we did not record cost of product revenue or gross margins from product sales 
inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
these results may not be indicative of future costs of product sales or gross margins 
we anticipate our cost of product revenue to increase in the future as a result of increased product sale volume  royalties that will be owed to fenwal on platelet and plasma system sales  and as we perform or find alternative service providers for supply chain and back office order fulfillment services 
research and development our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel  payments to consultants  costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials  third party costs for development activities  certain regulatory costs  costs for licensed technologies  and costs associated with our infrastructure  and laboratory chemicals and supplies

the primary reasons for the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to include the decline in development activities associated with our plasma system subsequent to receiving ce mark in november in addition  during the second half of we initiated a phase i clinical trial related to our red blood cell system 
costs associated with this phase i clinical trial were higher in than in  the period in which the clinical trial concluded 

table of contents research and development expenses for the year ended december   increased by million to million from million for the comparable period in in  we did not recognize non cash stock based compensation 
additional factors for the increase in research and development expenses during compared to  include costs incurred to conduct a phase i clinical trials for the red blood cell system  higher costs associated with the development of the plasma system  as well as an increase in the number of research and development personnel employed 
we anticipate that our research and development spending may increase in the future as a result of clinical trials and system development of our red blood cell system  as well as efforts to support regulatory filings and potential approvals of our platelet and plasma systems in the united states and other countries 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products  including but not limited to intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of clinical study results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete our research and development projects 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel  expenses for our commercialization efforts underway in europe  expenses for accounting  tax  and internal control  legal and facility related expenses  and insurance premiums

our historical selling  general and administrative results may not be indicative of future selling  general and administrative costs 
we anticipate our selling  general  and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we ramp up our intercept commercialization efforts and continue to work toward broader market acceptance of the intercept blood system 
we do not anticipate that the sale of the immunotherapy business to anza therapeutics will result in significant savings in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the future  as we did not transfer significant selling  general  and administrative assets or personnel to anza therapeutics 

table of contents gain on loan settlement years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change to change to gain on loan settlement under an agreement entered into with baxter in  we repaid million and concurrently entered into a promissory note for million payable with interest as full satisfaction of a loan obligation during the year ended december  as a result of the agreement  during the year ended december   we recorded a non operating gain of million

impairment of long term investment in related party years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage impairment of long term investment in related party we recorded an impairment to the carrying value on our investment in bioone of million during the second quarter of the impairment represents the difference in our carrying value of the bioone shares and the fair value of those same shares as a result of bioone s july equity financing 
if the assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our investment in bioone change further  or if bioone s business deteriorates  we will reassess the fair value of our investment which may result in additional impairment charges 
interest income expense and other  net years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage interest income expense and other  net interest income and other  net decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a non operating gain of million during the year ended december   resulting from cash consideration received from baxter as a component of the february commercialization transition agreement 
in addition  during  we recognized losses on certain marketable securities that we believed were experiencing an other than temporary decline in fair value 
in determining that each marketable security was experiencing other than temporary losses  we considered several factors  including the length and severity of the market decline  the expected length of time for the market prices of each security to approximate our carrying value  and our ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow the market prices to correct themselves  if ever 
the recognized losses adjust our carrying value to the fair value of the securities at december   which will become our basis for recording future gains or losses upon sale or maturity 
partially offsetting this decrease from was an increase in interest income of million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily due to consistently higher cash and investment balances maintained during the year ended december   compared to the comparable period in  primarily as a result of our equity offerings in march and december interest income expense and other  net was million for the year ended december   and million for the corresponding period in the increase from was primarily due to the increase in interest income due to consistently higher cash and investment balances maintained during from  primarily as a result of our public offerings in in addition  we recognized a non operating gain of million during the year ended december   from cash consideration received from baxter as a result of the february commercialization transition agreement

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our sources of capital to date have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  payments received under our agreements with baxter  bioone and others  united states government grants and cooperative agreements  product sales and interest income 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to decreases in our revenues and related cash collections in compared to  as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably increases in our inventory purchases 
net cash flows from operations was generally consistent from to  although changes in our operating assets and liabilities showed variations primarily due to our assumption of intercept commercialization rights in early net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to cash used in investing activities of million during the year ended december  the change was primarily due to the maturities of short term investments  partially offset by the purchases of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period in the increase in compared to is largely due to the issuance of  shares of common stock in a public offering in march  providing net proceeds of million  and the issuance of  shares of common stock in a registered direct offering in december  providing net proceeds of approximately million  offset by the repayment of a loan from baxter capital of million plus accrued interest 
we believe that our available cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from product sales and existing development and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements beyond these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including the progress and costs of development and commercialization of the intercept blood system  cash collected from product sales  and from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors and on our ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of the intercept blood system and other product candidates  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to our investors  and may not be available on favorable terms or at all

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and limit duration by restricting the term for single securities and for the portfolio as a whole

we maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets 
certain of the investments in our portfolio are subject to general market risk and more specifically  the us mortgage industry 
while we believe that we will be able to recognize the fair value of these instruments when they mature or we sell them  there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that these investments are with will be able to meet their debt obligations

product sales for our blood safety products are predominantly made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we incur operating expenses  including payment for finished goods inventory of disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems  generally in euros and  to a much lesser degree  other foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support of our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of interest income expense and other  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results of operations
