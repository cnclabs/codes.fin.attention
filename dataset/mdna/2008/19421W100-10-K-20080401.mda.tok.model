by offering on trend targeted product  we successfully build a connection with our customers 
we interpret fashion trends timely and translate this into on trend product in our stores through an extensive due diligence process 
beginning about a year in advance  we review key fashion markets worldwide 
we employ trend services and examine the industry s ready to wear forecasts  then  we test product 
by doing so  we gain valuable intelligence well in advance of the seasons arrival 
we refine our ideas  commit to a product assortment  and display that assortment in our stores at about the same time as other fashion oriented higher priced competitors 
customers demand on trend products  but have different definitions of what that means 
importantly  we believe merchandise can be on trend at a great value 
customers will always find tiered pricing at payless with good better best price points 
through elements of promotion and pricing tiers  we strive to maintain market share with budget oriented shoppers while driving the opportunity to increase market share with expressive customers 
the next component of the payless strategy is brand marketing effectiveness  and the development of a house of brands architecture 
we are building  licensing and buying appropriate authentic and aspirational brands to appeal to our major 
table of contents customer segments

fin  on february  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits

the net operating losses related to recorded assets will expire as follows million in through  and million by federal foreign tax credit carryforwards are million and state income tax credit carryforwards are million  less a valuation allowance of million 
the remaining million of our total valuation allowance of million relates to other deferred tax assets in a latin american country that does not have a history of earnings 
the tax credit carryforwards related to the recorded assets expire as follows million by  million in and million may be carried forward indefinitely 
the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  the jobs act  provided for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the us pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
during  our chief executive officer established domestic reinvestment plans which were approved by the board of directors 
pursuant to the plans  we repatriated million from foreign subsidiaries during the repatriation resulted in recognition of million of income tax expense in at the close of  we have not provided tax on our cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million  because it is our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
the calculation of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is complex and is not practicable 
if earnings were distributed  we would be subject to us taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign governments 
based on the facts and circumstances at that time  we would determine whether a credit for foreign taxes already paid would be available to reduce or offset the us tax liability 
we anticipate that earnings would not be repatriated unless it was tax efficient to do so 

table of contents impact of inflation inflation did not have a material impact on our net sales growth or net earnings for the three years in the period ended february  in fiscal year  we expect inflationary pressures exacerbated by the weak dollar from china  where a majority of our product is made 
we are looking for ways to control costs by working with our factory partners on opportunities for production further inland and north in china as well as other countries such as indonesia and india  as well as expanding our existing presence in vietnam 
we believe we will be able to manage cost by using a number of initiatives such as more direct sourcing  the consolidation of raw material suppliers  and the consolidation of factories 
minority interest  net of income taxes minority interest represents our joint venture partners share of net earnings or losses on applicable international operations 
the increase in minority interest expense from to and to is due to increased earnings from our joint ventures

there was no income or loss from discontinued operations in the loss from discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes and minority interest  during primarily relates to operating performance and disposal costs associated with our retail operations in japan 
the loss from discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes and minority interest  during primarily relates to disposal costs associated with our discontinued parade  chile and peru stores and well as stores in north america 
environmental liability in connection with the stride rite acquisition  we acquired a distribution facility with a related environmental liability 
the liability as of february  was million  million of which was included as an accrued expense and million of which was included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the assessment of the liability and the associated costs were an estimate based upon available information after consultation with environmental engineers  consultants and attorneys assisting the company in addressing these environmental issues in the fourth quarter of as of february   the estimated costs to address these environmental conditions ranged from million to million  including million of costs that have already been paid 
actual costs to address the environmental conditions may change based upon further investigations  the conclusions of regulatory authorities about information gathered in those investigations  the inherent uncertainties involved in estimating conditions in the environment  and the costs of addressing such conditions 
any changes to the estimated liability will be finalized as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition of stride rite s closing date  when information that is known to be available or obtainable is obtained 
any changes to the liability within one year of this acquisition s closing date will impact goodwill for this transaction

we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments on the remaining balance 
financial condition ratios a summary of key financial information for the periods indicated is as follows debt capitalization ratio debt to capitalization has been computed by dividing total debt by capitalization 
total debt is defined as long term debt including current maturities  notes payable and borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
capitalization is defined as total debt and shareowners equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio  including the present value of future minimum rental payments under operating leases as debt and as capitalization  was  and  respectively  for the periods referred to above 
the increase of the debt capitalization ratio as of february  is due to the additional debt incurred to finance the stride rite acquisition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
inventories merchandise inventories in our stores are valued by the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
prior to shipment to a specific store  inventories are valued at the lower of cost using the fifo basis  or market 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail method  cost is determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio across groupings of similar items  known as departments 
as a result  the retail method results in an averaging of inventory costs across similar items within a department 
the cost to retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis 
current owned retail represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis reduced for any permanent or clearance markdowns 
as a result  the retail method normally results in an inventory valuation that is lower than a traditional fifo cost basis 
inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including markdowns and shrinkage  which can significantly impact the owned retail and  therefore  the ending inventory valuation at cost 
specifically  the failure to take permanent or clearance markdowns on a timely basis can result in an overstatement of cost under the retail method 
we believe that our application of the retail method reasonably states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
wholesale inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 
the fashion oriented nature of our business  along with the potential for changes in customer preferences and the extended product development lead times  leave us vulnerable to the risk of inventory obsolescence both at our own stores and within our wholesale inventories 
we are also exposed to the risk of inventory markdowns for excess or obsolete products  both at retail stores and from independent retailers 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  
table of contents based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred  while expenditures for store remodels  refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the product capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
projects in progress are stated at cost  which includes the cost of construction and other direct costs attributable to the project 
no provision for depreciation is made on projects in progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and put into service 
property and equipment are reviewed on a store by store basis if an indicator of impairment exists to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable 
estimated future cash flows on a store by store basis are used to determine if impairment exists 
the underlying estimates of cash flows include estimates of future revenues  gross margin rates and store expenses and are based upon the stores past and expected future performance 
to the extent our estimates for revenue growth and gross margin rates are not realized  assessments of collectibility could result in impairment charges 
defined benefit plan the company has defined benefit pension plans 
one of the plans is frozen and no longer accrues future retirement benefits 
major assumptions used in the accounting for this employee benefit plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we use a cash flow matching approach for determining the appropriate discount rate for the defined benefit pension plan 
the approach is derived from us treasury rates  plus an option adjusted spread varying by maturity  to derive hypothetical aa corporate bond rates 
the calculation of pension expense is dependent on the determination of the assumptions used 
a basis point change in the discount rate will change expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the expected long term return on assets will result in an approximate change of million in the expense 
insurance programs we retain our normal expected losses related primarily to workers compensation  physical loss to property and business interruption resulting from such loss and comprehensive general  product  and vehicle liability 
we purchase third party coverage for losses in excess of the normal expected levels 
provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon estimates of aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing independent actuarial calculations 
these actuarial calculations utilize assumptions including historical claims experience  demographic factors and severity factors to estimate the frequency and severity of losses as well as the patterns surrounding the emergence  development and settlement of claims 
accounting for taxes we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on february  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred 
table of contents tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which  more likely than not  the future tax benefits will not be realized 
asset retirement obligations we follow fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires entities to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated future cost to retire an asset  if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
our asset retirement obligation aro liabilities are primarily associated with our personal property and trade fixtures which  at the end of a lease  we are contractually obligated to remove in order to restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease agreement 
we estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on current store closing costs and discount the removal costs back as if they were to be performed at the inception of the lease 
at the inception of such a lease  we record the aro as a liability and also record a related asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the liability 
the capitalized asset is then depreciated on a straight line basis over the useful life of the asset 
upon retirement of the asset  any difference between the actual retirement costs incurred and the previously recorded estimated aro liability is recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of earnings 
in future periods  we may make adjustments to the aro liability as a result of the availability of new information  changes in labor costs and other factors 
the estimate of the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment  including average store closing costs  inflation rates  labor costs and asset re use rates 
we cannot predict what revisions to these assumptions will be required in future periods 
we adopted fin during the fourth quarter of the initial adoption resulted in a charge of million net of income taxes and minority interest  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the adoption increased net property and equipment by million  increased asset retirement obligations by million  and increased deferred tax assets by million 
environmental reserves we accrue for costs associated with environmental obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities including auditing guidance 
accruals to address estimated costs for environmental obligations generally are recognized no later than the date when we learn what cleanup measures  if any  are likely to occur to address the environmental conditions at issue 
in accordance with sop  included in such obligations are the estimated direct costs to investigate and address the conditions on our property and the associated engineering  legal and consulting costs 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
share based compensation we account for share based awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
as required by sfas no 
r  share based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using a binomial model 
the binomial model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected life  stock price volatility and the forfeiture rate 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for business combinations in accordance with accounting for business combinations under sfas no 
business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
we use all available information to estimate fair values including the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation  as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date when information that is known to be available or obtainable is obtained 
our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
accounting for goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit using both a market approach and an income approach 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
given the decline in our market value during  we updated our impairment analysis and concluded there was no impairment as of february  however  if our market value continues to decline we may have a resulting impairment charge 
the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment related to the estimate of the magnitude and timing of future reporting unit cash flows 
if we determine that the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we will recognize an impairment charge 
if goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our recognized goodwill totaled million as of february  accounting for intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
favorable leases  certain trademarks and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using the straight line method 
customer relationships are amortized using an economic patterning technique based on when the benefits of the asset are expected to be used 
each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each intangible asset 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
additionally  events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of one or more intangible assets is not recoverable and its fair value is less than the intangible asset s carrying value  resulting in recognition of an impairment charge 
a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more intangible assets or the impairment of one or more intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of february  accounting for derivatives we participate in interest rate related derivative instruments to manage our exposure on our debt instruments 
we record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended 
the calculation of the fair value of the interest rate related derivative instruments is based on estimates of future interest rates  which may change based on economic or other factors 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded either through current earnings or as other comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedge designation 
gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
as of february   a basis point increase in libor on the unhedged portion of the company s debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million annually or approximately million per quarter

table of contents foreign currency risk we have operations in foreign countries  therefore  our cash flows in us dollars are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we adjust our retail prices  when possible  to reflect changes in exchange rates to mitigate this risk 
to further mitigate this risk  we may  from time to time  enter into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies 
for the fiscal years ended february   february  and january   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our operations or cash flows and we did not enter into any forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies 
a significant percentage of our footwear is sourced from the people s republic of china the prc 
the national currency of the prc  the yuan  is currently not a freely convertible currency 
the value of the yuan depends to a large extent on the prc government s policies and upon the prc s domestic and international economic and political developments 
since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of the prc s currency was pegged to the us dollar at a virtually fixed rate of approximately yuan per us dollar 
however  during  the prc s government revalued the yuan and adopted a more flexible system based on a trade weighted basket of foreign currencies of the prc s main trading partners 
under the new managed float policy  the exchange rate of the yuan may shift each day up to in either direction from the previous day s close  and as a result  the valuation of the yuan may increase incrementally over time should the prc central bank allow it to do so  which could significantly increase the cost of the products we source from the prc 
as of february   the last day of trading in our fiscal year  the exchange rate was yuan per us dollar
