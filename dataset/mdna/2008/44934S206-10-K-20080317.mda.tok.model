results of operations overview icad is an industry leading provider of computer aided detection solutions cad that enable radiologists and other healthcare professionals to better serve patients by identifying pathologies and pinpointing cancer earlier 
early detection of cancer is the key to better prognosis  less invasive and lower treatment costs  and higher survival rates 
performed as an adjunct to mammography screening  cad has quickly become the standard of care in breast cancer detection  helping radiologists improve clinical outcomes while enhancing workflow 
cad for mammography screening is also reimbursable in the united states under federal and most third party insurance programs 
since receiving fda approval for the company s first breast cancer detection product in january  over eighteen hundred of our cad systems have been placed in mammography practices worldwide 
icad is the only stand alone company offering cad solutions for the early detection of breast cancer 
in late  the company began to see a shift in sales from its film based analog cad technology to its digital cad technology 
this shift has been primarily fueled by the results reported in in the new england journal of medicine from the american college of radiology imaging network s acrin digital mammographic imaging screening trial dmist 
the trial showed that there was no difference in accuracy between the two modalities for screening asymptomatic women in general 
but for three subgroups of women which represent over of the population  digital mammography performed better than film based analog mammography 
additionally  digital mammography offers better clinical images combined with significant workflow improvements for the radiologist 
cad technology is more often purchased for use with digital mammography equipment than is purchased for use with analog mammography equipment 
the company believes that the shift to digital cad technology will continue and as such it will continue to have a positive impact on the company s overall financial performance  primarily because as the number of facilities converting to digital mammography systems continues to grow  the company expects to realize higher revenue of its digital products due to the higher adoption rate of digital cad technology as compared to analog cad technology and from higher gross margins realized on the company s digital products 
icad s cad products have been shown to detect up to percent of the cancers that biopsy proved were missed on the previous mammogram  an average of months earlier 
our advanced pattern recognition technology analyzes images to identify patterns and then uses sophisticated mathematical analysis to mark suspicious areas 
the company intends to apply its core competencies in pattern recognition and algorithm development in disease detection 
our focus is on the development and marketing of cancer detection products for disease states where there are established or emerging protocols for screening as a standard of care 
icad expects to pursue development of products for select disease states where it is clinically proven that screening has a significant positive impact on patient outcomes  where there is an opportunity to lower health care costs  where screening is non invasive or minimally invasive and where public awareness is high 
virtual colonoscopy ctc is a technology that has evolved rapidly in recent years 
we expect that the market for virtual colonoscopy will grow 
the anticipated growth is due to the increased demand for the procedures for early detection of colon cancer  combined with the recent results of the national ct colonography trial demonstrating that ctc is highly accurate for the detection of intermediate and large polyps and that the accuracy of ctc is similar to colonoscopy 
ct colonography or ctc is emerging as an alternative imaging procedure for evaluation of the colon 
the company is developing a product for computer aided detection of polyps using ctc 
colorectal cancer has been shown to be highly preventable with early detection and removal of polyps 
the company s cad systems include proprietary algorithm technology together with standard computer and display equipment 
cad systems for the film based analog mammography market also include a radiographic film digitizer  manufactured by the company that utilizes the company s proprietary technology for the digitization of film based medical images 
the company s headquarters are located in southern new hampshire  with manufacturing and contract manufacturing facilities in new hampshire and massachusetts and a research and development facility in ohio 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to accounts receivable allowance  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
additionally  the company uses assumptions and estimates in calculations to determine stock based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  goodwill  product warranties  stock based compensation  income taxes 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized when the product ships provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  collectability is probable and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
the company considers the guidance for revenue recognition in the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company s revenue transactions can on occasion include product sales with multiple element arrangements  generally for installation 
the elements are considered separate units of accounting because the delivered product has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element based on its estimated relative fair market value 
fair market value is determined using entity specific and third party evidence 
a portion of the arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue when the product is shipped and a portion of the arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue when the installation service is performed 
the value of the undelivered elements includes the fair value of the installation 
if the terms of the sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated  all revenues are deferred and not recognized until such acceptance occurs 
the company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  if any  and the installation process 
there are no significant estimates or assumptions used in the company s revenue recognition 
the company defers revenue for extended service contracts related to future periods and recognizes revenue on a straight line basis in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs on original product warranties at the time of sale 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because it is governed by multiple complex accounting rules and it is important for readers of our financial statements to understand the basis upon which our revenues are recorded 
in addition  the company believes that its investors value the company and track its progress based to a large extent upon revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying credit limits 
the company s senior management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables may potentially be uncollectible 
the company includes any accounts receivable balances that it determines may likely be uncollectible  along with a general reserve for estimated probable losses based on historical experience  in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
an amount would be written off against the allowance after all attempts to collect the receivable had failed 
based on the information available to the company  it believes the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory primarily based upon estimated usage of its inventory as well as other factors 
long lived assets long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of patents  technology intangibles and trade name purchased in the acquisition of issi in june and cadx in december these assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
goodwill the company follows the provision of fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires companies to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas addresses the accounting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually 
the company operates in one segment and as one reporting unit since its products perform the same basic function  have common sales channels and resellers  and are developed and supported by one central staff 
therefore  the company assumes market capitalization is the best evidence of fair value market capitalization is calculated using the quoted closing share price of its common stock at its annual impairment date of october  multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding of the company 
the company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing its market capitalization fair value to its carrying value in accordance with paragraph of sfas  which notes that quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and will be used as the basis for the measurement 
the fair value of the company is compared to the carrying amount at the same date as the basis to determine if an impairment exists 
at october  the company s market capitalization exceeded its carrying amount and it determined that there was no impairment to its goodwill 
additionally  the company reviews fair value and goodwill impairment quarterly to determine if facts or circumstances have occurred that would trigger impairment prior to the annual impairment date 
since the company s carrying amount has not exceeded its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test has been unnecessary 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranty against defects in material and workmanship based on historical warranty trends and costs  and the volume of product returns during the warranty period 
stock based compensation the company maintains stock based incentive plans  under which it provides stock incentives to employees and directors 
the company grants to employees and directors  restricted stock and options to purchase common stock at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
prior to the effective date of statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  the company applied apb  and related interpretations  for its stock option grants 
apb provides that the compensation expense relative to its stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant 
effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior periods are not restated 
the company used the black scholes and lattice option pricing models which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of its common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the provisions of sfas r apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding  but not yet vested  on the date the company adopted sfas r 
stock based compensation expense was included in applicable departmental expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal and periods 
income taxes the company follows the liability method under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
the primary objectives of accounting for taxes under sfas are to a recognize the amount of tax payable for the current year and b recognize the amount of deferred tax liability or asset for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december   and as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
