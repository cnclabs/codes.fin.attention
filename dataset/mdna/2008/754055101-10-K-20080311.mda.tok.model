table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  as set forth in part i of this report under special note regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in part i item a and elsewhere in this report 
the historical results set forth in this discussion and analysis are not necessarily indicative of trends with respect to any actual or projected financial performance 
overview we are an environmentally focused geothermal power development and technology licensing company 
we operate in two business segments power systems and transportation and industrial technology 
our power systems segment is seeking to develop clean  renewable geothermal electric power plants and bottom cycling operations 
our transportation and industrial technology segment focuses on using our symetron technology to improve the efficiency of electric motors and related components 
through these two business segments  we are employing a well to wheels strategy in an effort to produce a positive impact on the environment and economically beneficial results for our stockholders 
by executing our well to wheels strategy  we aim to become both a producer of clean  geothermal electric power as well as a provider of technologies that improve the efficiency of electric motors used in hybrid electric vehicles and other applications 
sources of revenue to date  our primary source of revenue has been from research and development subcontracts  administered through contractors with certain government agencies 
pursuant to these subcontracts  we perform engineering design  development and testing activities in an effort to demonstrate that specific applications of our technology are viable 
we expect to continue to generate modest revenues from research and development contracts and subcontracts awarded by government agencies and private companies as we seek to commercialize our technologies 
we are seeking to generate new revenues from both of our business segments 
our power systems segment is seeking to generate revenues from the geothermal power plants it intends to develop 
our transportation and industrial technology segment is seeking to generate revenues by licensing our symetron tm technologies to third parties 
although progress is being made by each of our business segments  significant revenues may not be generated by either of our segments for several years  if at all 
significant expenses we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had incurred an accumulated deficit and deficit accumulated after re entry into the development stage of approximately million on cumulative revenues since inception of approximately  our net losses before preferred stock dividends for the year ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during the twelve months ended december  our average monthly cash expenditure rate for operations increased to million per month from approximately million per month for the twelve months ended december  the higher spending rate primarily reflects increased employment levels and prospecting and exploration costs associated with geothermal power plant development 
we expect that our average monthly cash expenditure rate will continue to increase as we implement our plans to develop geothermal power plants 

table of contents for the year ended december   our operating expenses consisted primarily of cost of sales  general and administrative expenses  power project development expenses and research and development expenses 
prior to  our power project development expenses were considered immaterial and were included in general and administrative expenses 
consequently  for the years ended december  and  our operating expenses consisted primarily of cost of sales  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
cost of sales for each of the periods presented includes the direct labor  materials and overhead expenses required to perform work on research and development subcontracts 
these subcontracts relate to certain potential applications of the technologies our transportation and industrial technology segment is seeking to commercialize 
general and administrative expenses for all periods presented include expenses related to our marketing  sales  accounting  legal  investor relations  human resources and other administrative functions 
non capitalized expenses associated with our power systems segment prior to  which primarily related to prospecting and exploration  were also included in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses also include non cash equity based compensation paid to employees  consultants and service providers 
we have made significant use of non cash equity based compensation to conserve cash and provide incentives to our employees 
we expect to continue to use equity based compensation to provide incentives to our employees and certain service providers 
power project development expenses prior to were immaterial and were included in general and administrative expenses 
power project development expenses for the year ended december  primarily include professional services for mapping  environmental and geological studies  and other prospecting costs related to the exploration for geothermal resources 
we expect that our power project development expenses will increase in future periods as we pursue the development of additional power projects and continue to explore for geothermal resources 
research and development expenses for all periods presented primarily include the costs incurred by our transportation and industrial technology segment in connection with engineering design  development and testing of the technologies it is seeking to commercialize 
total engineering expenses for each period are allocated between cost of sales and research and development based on the engineering time and expenses by project 
while we do not expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in future periods  our research and development expenses will increase as we pursue additional opportunities to commercialize our technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our audited consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item of this annual report 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
the application of these policies requires management to use significant judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain when reporting financial results 
such estimates are based upon management s historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  management observance of trends in the transportation  industrial and power production industries  information provided by our customers and information available to management from other outside sources  as appropriate 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
we describe specific risks related to these critical accounting policies below 
regarding all of these policies  we caution that future results rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts impairment of long lived assets tangible and intangible asset retirement obligations valuation allowance against deferred income taxes stock based compensation business combinations successful efforts method of accounting for geothermal energy activities revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  including staff accounting bulletin or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  as amended 
although we have earned limited revenue since inception  we expect to earn revenue in the future through both of our business segments 
our only current source of revenue is generated through our transportation and industrial technology segment from subcontracted engineering services for a governmental agency in accordance with specific performance criteria 
this revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
costs incurred to achieve the performance criteria are deferred and recognized concurrent with the recognition of revenue unless they are determined to be unrecoverable 
for contracts in which the fee is estimated to equal of the cost to complete the contract  we recognize revenue as the cost is incurred to complete the project using zero as our estimate of profit under the percentage of completion method 
if estimated costs exceed projected revenues for a reporting period  we recognize a loss on the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  changes in the estimated time and cost to complete the contract may affect the time period over which the unrecognized revenues and related costs are recognized 
the primary sources of anticipated revenue for our power systems segment are expected to be long term power purchase agreements with public and municipal electric utilities 
these agreements typically provide for payments based upon a per kilowatt hour generation of electricity 
we also expect to earn revenue from fees and other distributions paid to us by project entities  primarily capitalized by financing partners for the allocation of certain tax attributes associated with the geothermal power plants we intend to develop 
intercompany power systems revenue generated from royalties  leases  and operating fees for managing the construction and operations of the geothermal power plants we intend to develop will be eliminated in the consolidation of our financial statements 
in the future  we expect that our transportation and industrial technology segment will generate revenue from contracted and subcontracted engineering services 
recognition of revenue related to engineering services will depend on whether the revenue is non refundable  based upon performance criteria milestones  or contingent on deliverables required by the applicable agreement 
if the fee is non refundable  we have no specific milestones to meet  and there are no required performance criteria  we will recognize the revenue as the cost is incurred to complete the project on the percentage of completion basis 
for agreements with specific milestones that must be met before payment becomes due  we will recognize the revenue at the completion of each milestone on the percentage of completion basis 
costs incurred to achieve the milestones will be deferred until the recognition of the related revenue unless such costs are determined not to be recoverable 
for payments that are contingent on deliverables required by the applicable agreement  the revenue will be recognized when the performance is complete 
costs incurred relating to the performance of the applicable agreement are expensed as research and development costs when incurred 
we also expect our transportation and industrial technology segment to generate future revenue from fees received for the license of our technologies 
recognition of license fee revenue will occur when a signed agreement exists with the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  we have delivered the license to the customer  collection of the license fee is reasonably assured  and we have no ongoing or future service 
table of contents obligation 
if the applicable license agreement requires us to provide services in connection with the license over a period of time  the license fee revenue will be recognized ratably over such period 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
contractual rights to future payments associated with trade accounts receivable and notes receivable are evaluated to determine the likelihood of collecting amounts due 
the evaluation includes a review of available financial information related to the debtors ability to pay  historical payment pattern  security positions  government regulations  most recent communications and an assessment of current economic conditions in determining the net realizable value of our receivables 
we also review our allowance for uncollectible accounts in aggregate for adequacy following this assessment 
changes in the customer s economic environment could reduce our ability to fully collect the receivable 
impairment of long lived assets tangible and intangible 
equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the remaining life of the lease 
costs of internally developing  maintaining or restoring patents and trademarks that are specifically identifiable and have determinate lives are capitalized 
the costs of patents are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life or years from the date of the first filing 
the costs of trademarks are not amortized because their useful lives are indefinite 
costs incurred to acquire our global heat transfer technology license have been capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related patents underlying and accompanying the license  or years 
costs incurred to acquire unproved geothermal properties are capitalized and not amortized until viable resources are discovered 
once viable resources are discovered  the property is classified as a proved property and capitalized costs are amortized 
exploration costs including costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties  such as delay rentals  certain taxes on the properties  legal costs for title defense  and the maintenance of land and lease records are expensed when incurred 
assuming they cannot be used as re injection wells  unsuccessful exploration or dry hole wells on unproved properties are expensed in the period in which the wells are determined to be dry 
dry hole wells on proved property are capitalized and amortized 
unsuccessful exploration or drilling could result in a significant increase in expenses during the period of determination due to the write off of previously capitalized assets 
we are currently assessing which generally accepted accounting principle method to use for depletion 
we assess recoverability of our patents by determining whether the amortization of the balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate which reflects our average cost of funds 
we have experienced a challenge to our intellectual trademark by razor usa llc 
we believe that the opposition filed before the trademark trial and appeals board is without merit 
we will vigorously defend the trademark and will capitalize the amount spent in defense of the trademark rights as long as a successful outcome is reasonably anticipated 
a negative outcome would result in impairment of the trademark which would be written off and expensed accordingly 
we periodically review equipment  intangible assets and unproved geothermal properties for impairment 
abandoned or permanently impaired assets are written off and expensed in the period when the impairment occurs 
asset retirement obligations 
we expect to incur certain liabilities related to the retirement of assets in connection with the geothermal power plants our power systems segment intends to develop 
these liabilities 
table of contents will include our obligations to plug wells upon termination of our operating activities  dismantle geothermal power plants upon cessation of operations and perform certain remedial measures related to the land on which such operations were conducted 
when a new liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded  we will capitalize the costs of such liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
such liability will be accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost will be amortized over the useful life of the related proved asset or written off when the project is determined unsuccessful 
at retirement  an entity will either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or a loss with respect thereto  as applicable 
we will estimate the costs related to such liabilities  and if such estimates are incorrect  then the capitalized costs and carrying amount of the related long lived asset will change  which could affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
valuation allowance against deferred income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded when there is a difference between the financial reporting and tax treatment of financial transactions 
we recorded a valuation allowance to offset the entire net deferred tax asset as of december   and  respectively 
the valuation allowance was recorded due to the losses incurred and the uncertainties regarding the future taxable income and recoverability of such deferred tax assets 
we continually evaluate the estimated recoverability of deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the revised standard  companies may no longer account for share based compensation transactions  such as stock options  restricted stock  and certain other potential payments using the intrinsic value method as defined in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
instead  companies are required to account for such equity transactions using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest due to the fact that service or performance conditions are not satisfied 
however  compensation expense already recognized is not adjusted if market conditions are not met  such as when stock options expire out of the money  or when options expire unexercised 
the new standard was adopted using the modified prospective method and beginning with the first quarter of  we record compensation expense in accordance with sfas r s transition provision 
under the modified prospective method  the effect of the standard is recognized in the period of adoption and in future periods 
prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard 
stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force  eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods  or services 
these standards require expense recognition based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we calculate the fair value of options and warrants granted by using the black scholes option pricing model as of either the grant date or performance completion date  as applicable 
we base our black scholes assumptions used to calculate the fair value of equity instruments on certain historical and estimated future events 
in the event that such estimates are incorrect  then the equity based expenses will change and as a result may affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we have issued shares of common stock to certain employees and directors as payment for services and have entered into agreements to issue stock over a specified vesting period 
we have also issued shares of common stock to non employees as payment for services and have entered into agreements to issue stock either when a performance condition has been completed or based upon a specified vesting period 
stock issued for services  to both employees and non employees  is valued based on the fair value on either the grant date or the performance completion date as required by sfas no 
r and eitf and is recognized over the requisite service period 

table of contents successful efforts method of accounting for geothermal energy activities 
the sec has prescribed financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
while these standards do not apply  by their terms  to geothermal energy activities  we believe these standards set forth the accepted standards for companies engaged in geothermal energy activities 
regulation s x prescribes two methods of accounting for oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we account for our geothermal properties using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  lease acquisition costs including lease bonuses  legal costs  permit costs  and the fair value of other forms of compensation to acquire the lease are capitalized as unproved property when incurred 
exploration costs including costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties  such as delay rentals  certain taxes on the properties  legal costs for title defense  and the maintenance of land and lease records are expensed when incurred 
once viable resources are discovered  the property is classified as a proved property and capitalized costs are amortized 
management is currently assessing which generally accepted accounting principle method to use for depletion 
assuming they cannot be used as re injection wells  unsuccessful exploration or dry hole wells on unproved properties are expensed in the period in which the wells are determined to be dry 
dry hole wells on proved property are capitalized and amortized 
unsuccessful exploration or drilling could result in a significant increase in expenses during the period of determination due to the write off of previously capitalized assets

revenue increased over as a result of progress toward completion of our research and development subcontract with arinc 
our work on the arinc subcontract began in october we account for this subcontract on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue for the year ended december  included million of revenue recognized on our research and development subcontract with advanced energy  which was completed in this subcontract allowed for reimbursement of a percentage of our incurred costs  and was accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
operating expenses cost of sales 
we reported cost of sales for the years ended december  and totaling million and million  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales for compared to the prior year is primarily related to a  loss during the first quarter of resulting from costs greater than originally anticipated to complete the arinc subcontract objectives 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in equity based non cash employee compensation expense  which declined to million in compared to million in equity based non cash compensation expense was higher in due to the vesting of a larger number of executive stock and option grants 
equity based non cash service provider compensation for decreased by approximately million from due to the issuance of fewer shares to service providers 
 shares of common stock were issued to a provider of financial services in while  shares of common stock were issued to a provider of financial advisory services in connection with our private equity placement in other employment related costs increased by approximately million during compared to  reflecting higher average salaries and employment levels 
professional service expenses remained relatively constant during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
office expenses increased by approximately million during as compared to due to the general increase in employment levels 
power project developments 
power project development expenses during the year ended december  totaled million 
equity based non cash employee and contractor compensation totaled million 
employment related costs for power project development employees totaled million and professional services relating to geological consulting totaled million 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  equity based non cash employee compensation decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the current year period 
the decrease resulted from the timing of issuing share grants to research and development employees 
cash based employee compensation decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the current year period reflecting a slight reduction in the number of employees performing research and development activities 
the portion of engineering expenses that could be attributed to cost of sales increased during the year ended december  over the comparable period by approximately million primarily due to the increased materials consumed in testing 
interest and other income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased slightly from the prior year period from million to approximately million 
the decrease is primarily due to higher average monthly cash balances in the prior year 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue during the year ended december   we recognized revenue totaling million 
revenue decreased compared to as a result of the completion of our subcontract with advanced energy in this contract allowed for reimbursement of a percentage of our incurred costs  and was accounted for on a percent completion basis 
we recognized revenue totaling million for the year ended december  from a combination of sources  including our contract with advanced energy  a small business innovative research grant with the us army  and various other contracts 
operating expenses cost of sales 
we reported cost of sales for the years ended december  and totaling million and million  respectively 
the decrease from the prior year is primarily related to completion of the advanced energy subcontract in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in equity based non cash employee compensation expense  
table of contents which increased from million in compared to million in this increase reflects the vesting of a larger number of executive stock and option grants during equity based non cash service provider compensation for increased by approximately million from due to the issuance of shares of common stock to a financial services provider 
other employment related costs increased by approximately million during compared to  reflecting higher average salaries and employment levels 
professional service expenses also increased by approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the higher professional service fees in were due primarily to higher legal fees resulting from a terminated merger agreement with a former merger candidate 
research and development 
research and development expense increased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  equity based non cash employee compensation included in research and development expense for increased by approximately million compared to  reflecting the expense of options and new equity grants to attract key employees 
cash based employee compensation included in research and development for increased by approximately million compared to reflecting both a higher number of employees and higher salary levels 
the portion of engineering expenses that could be attributed to cost of sales was lower in the year ended december  than the comparable period by approximately million primarily due to the timing between subcontracts 
interest and other income 
interest income increased approximately million for over the prior year reflecting higher commercial interest rates and the interest rate earned on a note payable by amp resources to us 
interest income includes approximately million related to the note receivable from amp resources during the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income was partially offset by increased series b warrant registration costs of million due to our failure to maintain a continuously effective registration for the common shares issuable upon exercise of the series b warrants 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash certificate of deposit unrestricted portion money market account total since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity instruments and borrowings 
most recently  in march  we raised gross proceeds of  before deducting fees and commissions  pursuant to the private placement of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the private placement  we also issued  warrants that were called in august  resulting in additional proceeds totaling million 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
our operating activities used approximately million  million  and approximately million of cash during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and we are not operating at cash breakeven 
our independent auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
their report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to the lack of sufficient capital  as of the date their report was issued  to support our business plan through the end of our continuation as a going concern is dependent on efforts to raise additional capital  increase revenues  reduce expenses  and ultimately achieve profitable operations 
if substantial losses continue  or if we are unable to raise sufficient  additional capital on reasonable terms  liquidity concerns may require us to curtail operations  liquidate or sell assets or pursue other actions that could adversely affect future operations 

table of contents the amount and timing of our future capital needs depend on many factors  including the timing of our development efforts  opportunities for strategic transactions  and the amount and timing of any revenues we are able to generate 
given our current business strategy  however  we will need to secure additional financing in order to execute our plans and continue our operations 
in addition to funding for general corporate purposes and certain other expenses  we will need to finance each of the geothermal power projects we intend to develop 
as more fully described below  we have entered into a commitment letter with merrill lynch 
the commitment letter sets forth certain general terms relating to the structure and financing of up to mw of geothermal power plants we intend to develop and includes a financing commitment from merrill lynch with respect to a mw plant we intend to develop in nevada 
the funding of the commitment for the nevada plant remains subject to certain conditions 
if merrill lynch elects to provide or arrange a financing commitment with respect to any additional projects  such financing commitment will be subject to satisfactory due diligence  the execution of a separate commitment letter relating to such project and certain other conditions 
even if we are able to obtain funding for the development of projects pursuant to the commitment letter  we will need additional financing to cover general operating expenses  well field development and certain other development expenses that are not covered by the commitment letter 
we will most likely seek funding for these expenses  as necessary  through the issuance of debt  preferred stock  equity or a combination of these instruments if available on reasonable terms or at all 
as part of our geothermal power project development efforts  we have made a variety of financial commitments 
currently  our most significant financial commitments relate to our obligations under our purchase agreements with utcp 
these purchase agreements allow us to order and purchase turbine generators and other major components for use in the geothermal power plants we intend to develop 
we are currently obligated to pay utcp million in and million per year beginning in and continuing through in connection with the lightening dock purchase  we also executed a promissory note in february whereby we agreed to pay to lightening dock  in principal plus  in interest charges on or before january  we expect to fund these obligations primarily through the financing commitments we intend to seek for the power projects we intend to develop 
however  we may need to obtain financing for a portion of these commitments from other sources 
we also have obligations to pay delay rentals and other expenses associated with the geothermal resources on properties in which we have acquired an interest 
generally  these obligations will not be financed as part of a financing commitment for a specific power project  and we will need to finance the payment of these obligations from other sources 
our commitment letter with merrill lynch on january   we  together with our wholly owned subsidiary  truckee geothermal no 
sv  llc the subsidiary  entered into the commitment letter with merrill lynch 
the commitment letter sets forth general terms relating to the structuring and financing of up to megawatts mw of geothermal power plants we intend to develop  including a financing commitment the truckee commitment from merrill lynch to provide non recourse financing for the construction of a mw geothermal power plant in nye county  nevada the truckee plant  subject to certain conditions as described below 
in connection with the commitment letter  we also granted to merrill lynch warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to vesting requirements associated with the financing of each of the power plants 
the truckee commitment is for up to million  including approximately million in the form of year fully amortizing notes  to fund approximately million of total construction costs  plus reserve accounts  accrued interest  transaction fees and other costs 
the balance of the commitment is attributable to a letter of credit to be required under a power purchase agreement 
the interest rate payable by us on the amortizing notes will be equal to libor plus basis points  swapped to a fixed rate of interest  determined at 
table of contents the time of funding 
the truckee commitment is subject to certain conditions precedent including  due diligence  the absence of a material adverse change  receipt of all necessary internal approvals by us and merrill lynch  acquisition of the class a interest as defined below in the truckee plant by a third party other than merrill lynch unless merrill lynch purchases such interest at its discretion and subject to certain conditions  merrill lynch s satisfaction with the final financial and tax model upon which the truckee commitment is based  and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions  including  but not limited to  execution of a power purchase agreement  satisfactory validation of the geothermal resource by a third party geothermal consultant  and a final report on the project by an independent engineer 
the subsidiary is a special purpose entity formed for the purpose of developing and operating the truckee plant 
the subsidiary will be responsible for the debt service  all maintenance and operations expenses and various fees and distributions to the owners of the subsidiary 
ownership of the subsidiary will be divided into the class a interest  to be owned by merrill lynch or a third party and the class b interest  to be owned by us 
it is the intention of the parties that the truckee plant will qualify to receive tax credits and other benefits under the internal revenue code of  as amended  for geothermal power plants 
during the first ten years of operations  the holder of the class a interest will be allocated of the income and the tax benefits of the subsidiary and make required capital contributions to the subsidiary  while the class b interest will receive of the cash available for distribution  subject to certain priority distributions 
the class a capital contributions  together with cash received by the subsidiary for the sale of electrical power  are expected to enable the subsidiary to service the debt financing and cover operating expenses  as well as pay certain fees and distributions to the holders of the class a interest and class b interest 
the finance structure is designed to convey the economic benefit to us through the payment of fees and cash distributions to us based upon both the successful completion of the truckee plant and attainment of on going operational targets 
after the first ten years of operation  the income and the tax benefits allocated to the class a and class b interests will change so that the class b interest will receive of income and cash distributions and the class a interest will receive of such benefits 
at that point  we will have the option to purchase the class a interests in order to obtain ownership of the project 
the commitment letter contemplates that any additional financing commitments provided in accordance with the commitment letter will be structured in a similar manner unless agreed otherwise by both parties 
if the truckee plant is constructed and placed into service  our share of fees and cash distributions from the subsidiary is estimated to be approximately million per year in gross fees and distributions during the truckee plant s first three years of operations  after maintenance  operating expenses and debt service 
after the first three years of operations  our share of fees and distributions will be reduced until the subsidiary repays the debt financing 
as a result  our average share of gross fees and distributions is estimated to be million per year for the first ten years of operations 
after the debt is retired in year of operations  we expect to receive gross distributions of more than million per year  or net after tax distributions of approximately million per year  for the remaining life of the truckee plant 
the expected useful life of the truckee plant is approximately years 
including the truckee commitment  the commitment letter gives merrill lynch the exclusive right to provide or arrange financing for up to mw of substantially similar geothermal power plants we intend to develop  other than certain excluded financings 
merrill lynch also has a right of first refusal with respect to the financing of an additional mw of geothermal plants to be developed by us 
if merrill lynch provides a financing commitment proposal with respect to any future projects  such financing commitment will be subject to satisfactory due diligence and certain other conditions and the execution of a separate commitment letter relating to such project 
until merrill lynch has financed mw of geothermal power projects under the commitment letter  we are generally obligated to accept any financing commitment proposed by merrill lynch that has terms similar to or more favorable than the financing commitment relating to the truckee plant 
after merrill lynch has financed mw of geothermal power projects under the commitment letter  we may enter into certain excluded financings with parties other than merrill lynch 

table of contents the timing of construction for the geothermal power plants we intend to develop  as well as the specific sites we choose to develop and construct  will depend on a number of factors  including drilling results  permitting and our ability to obtain adequate financing 
although the commitment letter includes the truckee commitment relating to the truckee plant  our development efforts at this site may not progress as rapidly as our development efforts at other sites 
as a result  we may seek to finance and construct geothermal power plants on other sites prior to the completion of construction of the truckee plant 
at the time we entered into the commitment letter  we believed it was likely that we would fund and construct the truckee plant earlier than the other sites we intend to develop 
however  based on the fact that some of the other projects are progressing more rapidly than the truckee project  it is likely that we will seek financing under the commitment letter to fund construction at one or more other sites prior to funding and constructing the truckee plant 
as part of the commitment letter  we have agreed to pay merrill lynch certain non refundable structuring fees in connection with the closing of each funding transaction 
the structuring fees will initially be  but will decrease for future financings once the cumulative financing commitment under the commitment letter reaches certain levels 
as additional consideration  we granted merrill lynch warrants to purchase our common stock 
the warrants will vest and become exercisable in increments over the term of the commitment letter based on the actual funding provided 
the exercise price of the warrants will range from to per share  subject to adjustment upon any dilutive issuance by the company 
in general  warrants that vest in connection with the funding of earlier projects will be greater in number and have a lower exercise price  and warrants that vest in connection with the funding of later projects will be fewer in number and have a higher exercise price 
under certain circumstances  a reduced percentage of the warrants will vest if we reject a merrill lynch funding proposal for a project and subsequently obtain funding for such project from another party or  in certain circumstances  from merrill lynch 
any vested warrants may be called for cancellation by us if certain conditions have been met  including minimum market price requirements relating to our common stock 
we have agreed to grant additional warrants to merrill lynch upon funding of any of the additional mw of geothermal power projects with respect to which merrill lynch has a right of first refusal 
the exercise price of any such additional warrants will be based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock over a consecutive trading day period prior to the issuance of such warrants 
pursuant to a registration rights agreement between us and merrill lynch  we have agreed to file one or more registration statements covering the resale of the warrants issued pursuant to the commitment letter  as well as the resale of the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of such warrants
