these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within the company s operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related statement of operations  asset and or liability amounts 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in certain instances  risk of ownership and title passes when the unit has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts and sales incentives  which historically have not been significant 
the collectability of any related receivable is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance  management considers factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
changes in these conditions may result in additional allowances 
inventory estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventory are based upon current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and will be written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit from which it was created

the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty agreements 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models 
for military vehicles with limited historical data  estimates were based upon historical experience of commercial vehicles

equity compensation sfas r  share based payment  addresses the accounting for share based employee compensation and was adopted by spartan motors  inc on january  utilizing the modified prospective approach 
the effect of applying sfas r and further information on spartan motors  inc equity compensation plans  including inputs used to determine fair value of options and stock appreciation rights sars is disclosed in note to the financial statements 
sfas r requires that share options and sars awarded to employees are recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value at grant date 
the fair market value of options and sars granted under the company s stock option plans was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for inputs such as interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and specific employee exercise behavior patterns based on statistical data 
some of the inputs we use are not market obs ervable and have to be estimated or derived from available data 
use of different estimates would produce different values  which in turn would result in higher or lower compensation expense recognized 
we have not run the model with alternative inputs to quantify their effects on the fair value of the options or sars 
to value options and sars  several recognized valuation models exist 
none of these models can be singled out as being the best or most correct one 
the model we apply is able to handle some of the specific features included in the awards we grant  which is the reason for its use 
if we were to use a different model  the values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using a different valuation model could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options and sars 
fair value could be either higher or lower than the ones produced by the model we apply and the inputs we used 
new and pending accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s revolving notes payable is generally tied to the prime and libor interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as six months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the company s ability to pass through cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
at december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its variable rate short term and long term debt agreements 
an increase of in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the company does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes 
the company does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss to the company 
as of the date of this report  the company does not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of its primary market risk exposure in the near term 
in this discussion  near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report 
prevailing interest rates and interest rate relationships are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond the company s control
