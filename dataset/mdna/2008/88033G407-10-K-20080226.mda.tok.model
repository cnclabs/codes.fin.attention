item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
properties description of real property 
our corporate headquarters are located in dallas  texas and  at december   our other administrative offices were located in los angeles and santa ana  california  ft 
lauderdale  florida  atlanta  georgia  st 
louis  missouri  and philadelphia  pennsylvania 
one of our subsidiaries leases the space for our dallas office under an operating lease agreement that expires in december  subject to our ability to hold over under the lease agreement until december other subsidiaries lease the space for our offices in los angeles  santa ana  ft 
lauderdale  atlanta  st 
louis and philadelphia under operating lease agreements 
our subsidiaries also owned or leased and operated medical office buildings at december   most of these buildings are adjacent to our general hospitals 
the locations of our hospitals and the number of licensed beds at each hospital at december  are set forth in the table beginning on page we believe that all of our properties  including the administrative and medical office buildings described above  are suitable for their intended purposes 
obligations relating to real property 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding loans secured by property and equipment  and we had approximately million of capital lease obligations 
in addition  from time to time  we lease real property to third party developers for the construction of medical office buildings 
under our current practice  the financing necessary to construct the medical office buildings encumbers only the leasehold and not our fee interest in the real estate 
in years past  however  we have at times subordinated our fee interest and allowed our property to be pledged as collateral for third party loans 
we have no contractual obligation to make payments on these third party loans  but our property could be subject to loss in the case of default by the lessee 
regulations affecting real property 
we are subject to a number of laws and regulations affecting our use of  and purchase and sale of  real property 
among these are california s seismic standards  the americans with disabilities act ada  and various environmental laws and regulations 
the state of california has established standards intended to ensure that all hospitals in the state withstand earthquakes and other seismic activity without collapsing or posing the threat of significant loss of life 
at this time  we are required to meet these standards by december   subject to a two year extension for hospital projects that are underway in advance of that date 
however  in november  the california building standards commission adopted regulations permitting the use of a new computerized evaluation tool for determining how at risk hospital buildings are of collapse in an earthquake  and this new tool is expected to result in fewer hospitals requiring retrofitting by the deadline 
we are in the process of providing the information required for evaluating all our hospitals in california 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations 
this amount has not been adjusted for inflation as there is currently a shortage of supplies  and there is expected to be a limited number of architects  engineers and contractors available to design and perform this work  both of which are causing a high inflation rate at this time 
it is possible that our estimate could be reduced once we receive the evaluation of our hospitals using the new evaluation tool 
in addition to safety standards  over time  hospitals must also meet performance standards meant to ensure that they are generally capable of providing medical services to the public after an earthquake or other disaster 
ultimately  all general acute care hospitals in california must meet seismic performance standards by to remain open 
to date  we have conducted engineering studies and developed compliance plans for all of our california facilities in continuing operations 
at this time  all of our general acute care hospitals in california are in compliance with all current seismic requirements 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public accommodations  including hospitals and other health care facilities  be made accessible to disabled persons 
our facilities are subject to a negotiated consent decree involving disability access 
in accordance with the terms of the consent decree  our facilities have agreed to implement disability access improvements  but have not admitted that they have engaged in any wrongful action or inaction 
in the year ended december   we spent approximately million on corrective work at our facilities  and we currently anticipate spending an additional million over the next four years 
noncompliance with the requirements of the ada or similar state laws could result in the imposition of fines against us by federal and state governments or the award of damages from us to individual plaintiffs 
in addition  noncompliance with court orders and consent decrees requiring disability access improvements could result in contempt proceedings and the imposition of criminal penalties 
our properties are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations  including with respect to asbestos abatement and the treatment of underground storage tanks  among other matters 
we believe it is unlikely that the cost of complying with such laws  rules and regulations will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
medical staff and employees general 
our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of individual hospitals 
under state laws and other licensing standards  hospital medical staffs are generally self governing organizations subject to ultimate oversight by the hospital s local governing board 
members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also often serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us 
members of our medical staffs are free to terminate their affiliation with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time 
although we operate some physician practices and  where permitted by law  employ some physicians  the overwhelming majority of the physicians who practice at our hospitals are not our employees 
nurses  therapists  lab technicians  facility maintenance workers and the administrative staffs of hospitals  however  normally are our employees 
we are subject to federal minimum wage and hour laws and various state labor laws  and maintain a number of different employee benefit plans 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of our employees and the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no long term contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain skilled employees and an appropriate number of quality physicians and other health care professionals in all specialties on our medical staffs 
in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians are experiencing in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
in addition  we believe physician attrition in our medical staffs is one of the reasons for our recent volume declines 
however  we are taking a number of steps to address the problem of volume decline  one of which is centered on building stronger relationships with the physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals 
although we will continue our efforts to successfully attract and retain key employees  qualified physicians and other health care professionals  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   the approximate number of our employees of which approximately were part time employees was as follows general hospitals and related health care facilities administrative offices total includes employees whose employment related to the operations of our general hospitals  cancer hospital  critical access facility  rehabilitation hospital  long term acute care hospital  skilled nursing facility  outpatient surgery centers  diagnostic imaging centers  occupational and rural health care clinics  physician practices  in house collection agency and other health care operations 
the largest concentrations of our employees excluding those in our administrative offices are in those states where we have the largest concentrations of licensed hospital beds of employees of licensed beds california florida texas union activity and labor relations 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities were represented by labor unions 
labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory 
we  and the hospital industry in general  are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
as union activity increases at our hospitals  our salaries  wages and benefits expense may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues 
in november  we entered into new collective bargaining agreements with the service employees international union seiu to replace expired collective bargaining agreements at hospitals in california and two hospitals in florida 
we also entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the seiu at coral gables hospital in florida after certain employees  including registered nurses  voted in favor of union representation at that facility in march the agreements  which were reached after months of negotiations between the parties  set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations through march in the case of our california hospitals and through various dates in for our florida facilities 
in addition  the agreements include improvements in employee work rules  create an education and training fund for employees  and contain terms that provide for greater predictability with respect to union organization efforts 
in august  we entered into successor  four year collective bargaining agreements with the california nurses association cna that cover nurses at nine hospitals in california 
these agreements provide for wage increases within our budgeted expectations 
we have also entered into separate peace accords with both the seiu and the cna that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize our employees 
the peace accord with the seiu expires in december  and the peace accord with the cna expires in december such agreements are becoming more common as employers attempt to balance the disruption caused by traditional union organizing with the rights of employees to determine for themselves whether to seek union representation 
in march  we reached an agreement with the united nurses associations of california on a new labor contract for nurses represented at four hospitals in california 
the agreement includes improvements in employee wages within our budgeted expectations  work rules and benefits  and was reached after several months of negotiations and good faith bargaining on the part of both parties 
we do not anticipate that any of the union and labor agreements we reached in will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
nursing shortage and mandatory nurse staffing ratios 
factors that adversely affect our labor costs include the nationwide shortage of nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
the national nursing shortage continues and remains more serious in key specialties and in certain geographic areas than others  including several areas in which we operate hospitals 
the nursing shortage has been a significant operating issue to health care providers  including us  and has resulted in increased labor costs for nursing personnel 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
the vast majority of hospitals in california  including our hospitals  are not at all times meeting the state mandated nurse staffing ratios  however  we have continued to improve our compliance and strive to make further improvements in nurse staffing ratio legislation has been proposed  but not yet enacted  in other states in which we operate hospitals  including pennsylvania and texas 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience significant salary  wage and benefit pressures created by the nursing shortage throughout the country and state mandated nurse staffing ratios  particularly in california 
in response to these trends  we have enhanced salaries  wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses 
in addition  we have been and may continue to be required to increase our use of temporary personnel  which is typically more expensive than hiring full time or part time employees 
significant efforts are being invested in workforce development with local schools of nursing and in recruitment of new graduates and experienced nurses 
competition in general  competition among health care providers occurs primarily at the local level 
a hospital s position within the geographic area in which it operates is affected by a number of competitive factors  including  but not limited to the scope  breadth and quality of services a hospital offers to its patients and physicians  the number  quality and specialties of the physicians who admit and refer patients to the hospital  nurses and other health care professionals employed by the hospital or on the hospital s staff  the hospital s reputation  its managed care contracting relationships  its location  the location and number of competitive facilities and other health care alternatives  the physical condition of its buildings and improvements  the quality  age and state of the art of its medical equipment  its parking or proximity to public transportation  the length of time it has been a part of the community  and the charges for its services 
in addition  tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
in certain states  including california  some not for profit hospitals are permitted by law to directly employ physicians while for profit hospitals are prohibited from doing so 
we also face increasing competition from physician owned specialty hospitals and freestanding diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
overall  our general hospitals and other health care businesses operate in highly competitive environments  and we believe recent declines in our patient volumes can be attributed  in part  to increased competition for physicians and patients 
we are taking a number of steps to address competition and increase patient volume 
broadly speaking  we attract physicians by striving to equip our hospitals with technologically advanced equipment and quality physical plant  properly maintaining the equipment and physical plant  providing high quality care to our patients and otherwise creating an environment within which physicians prefer to practice 
one of our specific initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered around understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
with our targeted growth initiative  we have been completing clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued  so that we can focus more resources on those services and market them to improve our results of operations 
our commitment to quality initiative  which we launched in  is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge 
we continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care 
as a result of these efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
further  each hospital has a local governing board  consisting primarily of community members and physicians that develop short term and long term plans for the hospital to foster a desirable medical environment for physicians 
each local governing board also reviews and approves  as appropriate  actions of the medical staff  including staff appointments  credentialing  peer review and quality assurance 
while physicians may terminate their association with our hospitals at any time  we believe that by striving to maintain and improve the quality of care at our hospitals and by maintaining ethical and professional standards  we will attract and retain qualified physicians with a variety of specialties 
health care regulation and licensing certain background information health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
changes in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government health care programs  hospital cost containment initiatives by public and private payers  proposals to limit payments and health care spending  and industry wide competitive factors greatly impact the health care industry 
the industry is also subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex  and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
although we have extensive policies and procedures in place to facilitate compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules and regulations  if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations discussed beginning on page 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
both federal and state government agencies continue heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts against the health care industry 
under the authority of the inspector general act of  the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs on an annual basis conducts a comprehensive work planning process to identify the areas most worthy of attention in the coming year 
the oig s ongoing and planned work includes examining the integrity of medicare and medicaid payments and the quality of care in long term care settings 
several initiatives in the oig s fiscal year work plan pertain to hospital payments  as well as cms policies and procedures regarding the joint commission hospital accreditation process 
an online version of the work plan is available at http oig

we believe that we  and the health care industry in general  will continue to be subject to increased government scrutiny and investigations such as these  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
another trend impacting health care providers  including us  is the increasing amount of qui tam recoveries obtained under the federal false claims act 
qui tam or whistleblower actions can also be filed under certain state false claims laws if the fraud involves medicaid funds or money from state and local agencies 
federal and state false claims laws allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government  alleging that a hospital or health care provider has defrauded a federal or state government program  such as medicare or medicaid 
if the government intervenes in the action and prevails  the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties for each false claim submitted to the government 
as part of the resolution of a qui tam case  the party filing the initial complaint may share in a portion of any settlement or judgment 
if the government does not intervene in the action  the qui tam plaintiff may continue to pursue the action independently 
although companies in the health care industry in general  and us in particular  have been and may continue to be subject to qui tam actions  we are unable to predict the future impact of such actions on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
anti kickback and self referral regulations medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments codified under section b b of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of health care services payable under the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by such programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal and civil penalties  as well as fines and possible exclusion from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
many states have statutes similar to the federal anti kickback statute  except that the state statutes usually apply to referrals for services reimbursed by all third party payers  not just federal programs 
in addition  it is a violation of the federal civil monetary penalties law to offer or transfer anything of value to medicare or medicaid beneficiaries that is likely to influence their decision to obtain covered goods or services from one provider or service over another 
the federal government has also issued regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships that are permissible under the anti kickback statute 
these regulations are often referred to as the safe harbor regulations 
the fact that certain conduct or a given business arrangement does not meet a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
rather  such conduct and business arrangements risk increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and should be reviewed on a case by case basis 
in addition to addressing other matters  as discussed below  the health insurance portability and accountability act of also amended title xi usc section et seq 
to broaden the scope of fraud and abuse laws to include all health plans  whether or not payments under such health plans are made pursuant to a federal program 
section of the social security act commonly referred to as the stark law generally restricts referrals by physicians of medicare or medicaid patients to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship  unless one of several exceptions applies 
the referral prohibition applies to a number of statutorily defined designated health services  such as clinical laboratory  physical therapy  radiology  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
the exceptions to the referral prohibition cover a broad range of common financial relationships 
these statutory  and the subsequent regulatory  exceptions are available to protect certain permitted employment relationships  leases  group practice arrangements  medical directorships  and other common relationships between physicians and providers of designated health services  such as hospitals 
a violation of the stark law may result in a denial of payment  required refunds to patients and the medicare program  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each violation  civil monetary penalties of up to  for sham arrangements  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each day that an entity fails to report required information  and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other federal programs 
many states have adopted or are considering similar self referral statutes  some of which extend beyond the related state medicaid program to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
our participation in and development of joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians could be adversely affected by these amendments and similar state enactments 
in accordance with our compliance program and our corporate integrity agreement with the federal government  which are described in detail under compliance program below  we have in place policies and procedures concerning compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  among others 
in addition  our compliance  law and audit services departments systematically review a substantial number of our arrangements with referral sources to determine the extent to which they comply with the anti kickback statute  the stark law and similar state statutes 
health insurance portability and accountability act title ii  subtitle f of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa mandates the adoption of specific standards for electronic transactions and code sets that are used to transmit certain types of health information 
hipaa s objective is to encourage efficiency and reduce the cost of operations within the health care industry 
to protect the information transmitted using the mandated standards and the patient information used in the daily operations of a covered entity  hipaa also sets forth federal rules protecting the privacy and security of protected health information 
the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the rights of patients to understand and control how their information is used and disclosed 
the law provides both criminal and civil fines and penalties for covered entities that fail to comply with hipaa 
hhs regulations include deadlines for compliance with the various provisions of hipaa 
effective october   cms will not process electronic claims that do not meet hipaa s electronic data transmission transaction and code set standards that health care providers must use when transmitting certain health care information electronically 
our electronic data transmissions are compliant with current standards 
all covered entities  including those we operate  were required to comply with the privacy requirements of hipaa by april  and the security requirements of hipaa by april  we are in material compliance with the privacy and security regulations  and we will continue to update training and procedures to address any compliance issues that develop 
further  all covered entities  including those we operate have been assigned unique digit numeric identifiers and otherwise currently comply with the national provider identifier requirements of hipaa 
we have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with hipaa  under the guidance of our compliance department 
hospital compliance officers and information security officers are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with our hipaa privacy and security policies and procedures at our hospitals 
we have also created an internal web based hipaa training program  which is mandatory for all employees 
based on existing and currently proposed regulations  we believe that the cost of our compliance with hipaa will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
health care facility licensing requirements in order to maintain their operating licenses  health care facilities must comply with strict governmental standards concerning medical care  equipment and cleanliness 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
our health care facilities hold all required governmental approvals  licenses and permits material to the operation of their business 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance in addition to certain statutory coverage limits and exclusions  federal laws and regulations  specifically the medicare conditions of participation  generally require health care providers  including hospitals that furnish or order health care services that may be paid for under the medicare program or state health care programs  to assure that claims for reimbursement are for services or items that are provided economically and only when  and to the extent  they are medically reasonable and necessary  of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care  and supported by appropriate evidence of medical necessity and quality 
cms administers the quality improvement organization qio program through a network of qios that work with consumers  physicians  hospitals and other caregivers to refine care delivery systems to assure patients receive the appropriate care at the appropriate time  particularly among underserved populations 
the qio program also safeguards the integrity of the medicare trust fund by reviewing medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges  and ensuring payment is made only for medically necessary services  and investigates beneficiary complaints about quality of care 
the qios have the authority to deny payment for services provided and recommend to hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with certain standards be excluded from participating in the medicare program 
medical and surgical services and practices are extensively supervised by committees of staff doctors at each of our health care facilities  are overseen by each facility s local governing board  the members of which primarily are community members and physicians  and are reviewed by our clinical quality personnel 
the local hospital governing board also helps maintain standards for quality care  develop short term and long range plans  and establish  review and enforce practices and procedures  as well as approves the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
certificate of need requirements some states require state approval for construction  expansion and closure of health care facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services 
certificates of need  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over health care facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
as of december   we operated hospitals in eight states that require a form of state approval under certificate of need programs applicable to those hospitals 
we are unable to predict whether we will be required or able to obtain any additional certificates of need in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required  or if any jurisdiction will eliminate or alter its certificate of need requirements in a manner that will increase competition and  thereby  affect our competitive position 
environmental regulations our health care operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
our operations also are subject to compliance with various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
we believe it is unlikely that the cost of such compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or cash flows 
compliance program general 
we maintain a multi faceted corporate and hospital based compliance program that is designed to assist our corporate and hospital staff to meet or exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations and industry practice 
we established our compliance department in to carry out compliance related functions previously carried out by our law department 
to ensure the independence of the compliance department  the following measures were implemented the compliance department has its own operating budget  the compliance department has the authority to hire outside counsel  to access any tenet document and to interview any of our personnel  and the chief compliance officer reports directly to the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 
in january  our board of directors approved a compliance program charter that furthered our goal of fostering and maintaining the highest ethical standards  and valuing our compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations as a foundation of our corporate philosophy 
the primary focus of the program is compliance with the requirements of the medicare and medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs 
pursuant to the terms of the compliance program charter  the compliance department is responsible for the following activities drafting company policies and procedures related to compliance issues  developing and providing compliance related education and training to all of our employees and  as appropriate  directors  contractors  agents and staff physicians  monitoring  responding to and resolving all compliance related issues  ensuring that we take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action when noncompliant or improper conduct is identified  and measuring compliance with our policies and legal and regulatory requirements related to health care operations 
in order to ensure the compliance department is well positioned to perform its duties as outlined in its charter  in we significantly expanded our compliance staff 
as part of this expansion  we hired regional compliance directors and have named a compliance officer for each hospital 
all hospital based compliance officers report to regional compliance directors who report directly to our chief compliance officer 
corporate integrity agreement 
in june  we entered into a broad civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice and other federal agencies that concluded several previously disclosed governmental investigations  including inquiries into our receipt of certain medicare outlier payments before  physician financial arrangements and medicare coding issues 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia in september with the oig 
the cia establishes annual training requirements and compliance reviews by independent organizations in specific areas 
in particular  the cia requires  among other things  that we maintain our existing company wide quality initiatives in the areas of evidence based medicine  standards of clinical excellence and quality measurements  maintain our existing company wide compliance program and code of conduct  formalize in writing our policies and procedures in the areas of billing and reimbursement  compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  and clinical quality  almost all of which were already in place when we entered into the cia and the remainder of which were put into place by january  provide a variety of general and specialized compliance training to our employees  contractors and physicians we employ or who serve as medical directors and or serve on our hospitals governing boards  and engage independent outside entities to provide reviews of compliance and effectiveness in five areas medicare outlier payments  diagnosis related group claims  unallowable costs  physician financial arrangements and clinical quality systems 
further  the cia requires us to maintain or establish performance standards and incentives that link compensation and incentive awards directly to clinical quality measures and compliance program effectiveness measures 
the cia also establishes a number of specific requirements for the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 
notably  the committee must retain an independent compliance expert  and assess our compliance program  including arranging for the performance of a review of the effectiveness of the program 
based on this work  the committee must then adopt a resolution regarding its conclusions as to whether we have implemented an effective compliance program 
we have taken  and continue to take  all necessary steps to promote compliance with the terms of the cia 
ethics program we maintain a values based ethics program that is designed to monitor and raise awareness of ethical issues among employees and to stress the importance of understanding and complying with our standards of conduct 
all of our employees  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and principal accounting officer  are required to abide by our standards of conduct to ensure that our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner 
the members of our board of directors and many of our contractors are also required to abide by our standards of conduct 
the standards reflect our basic values and form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with all corporate policies  procedures and practices 
our standards cover such areas as quality patient care  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  appropriate use of our assets  protection of patient information and avoidance of conflicts of interest 
as part of the program  we provide annual ethics and compliance training sessions to every employee  as well as our board of directors and certain physicians and contractors 
all employees are required to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of the standards of conduct  and are encouraged to contact our hour toll free ethics action line when they have questions about the standards or any ethics concerns 
incidents of alleged financial improprieties reported to the ethics action line or the compliance department are communicated to the audit committee of our board of directors 
all reports to the ethics action line are kept confidential to the extent allowed by law  and employees have the option to remain anonymous 
in cases reported to the ethics action line that involve a possible violation of the law or regulatory policies and procedures  the matter is referred to the compliance department for investigation 
retaliation against employees in connection with reporting ethical concerns is considered a serious violation of our standards of conduct  and  if it occurs  it will result in discipline  up to and including termination of employment 
the full text of our standards of conduct  and a number of our ethics and compliance policies and procedures  are published on our website  at www 
tenethealth 
com  under the compliance ethics caption in the our company section 
a copy of our standards of conduct is also available upon written request to our corporate secretary 
property and professional and general liability insurance property insurance 
we have property  business interruption and related insurance coverage to mitigate the financial impact of catastrophic events or perils that is subject to deductible provisions based on the terms of the policies 
these policies are on an occurrence basis 
under the policies in effect for the period april  through march   we have coverage totaling million per occurrence  after deductibles and exclusions  with annual aggregate sub limits of million each for floods and earthquakes and a per occurrence sub limit of million for windstorms with no annual aggregate 
with respect to fires and other perils  excluding floods  earthquakes and windstorms  the total million limit of coverage per occurrence applies 
deductibles are of insured values for floods  california earthquakes and wind related claims  of insured values for new madrid fault earthquakes  and million for fires and other perils 
for the policy period april  through march   we have coverage totaling million per occurrence  after deductibles and exclusions  with annual aggregate sub limits of million each for windstorms  floods and earthquakes 
with respect to fires and other perils  excluding windstorms  floods and earthquakes  the total million limit of coverage per occurrence applies 
deductibles are of insured values for wind related claims  floods and california earthquakes  of insured values for new madrid fault earthquakes  and million for fires and other perils 
professional and general liability insurance 
as is typical in the health care industry  we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
the health care industry has seen significant increases in the cost of professional liability insurance due to increased litigation 
in response  we formed captive insurance companies to self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability risk 
claims in excess of our self insurance retentions are insured with commercial insurance companies 
we generally have self insurance retentions of million per occurrence for each of the policy periods june  through may  and june  through may  as of january   our hospitals generally have a self insured retention of million per occurrence  with the healthcare insurance corporation  our captive insurance company  retaining the next million per occurrence 
prior to january   our hospitals generally had a self insurance retention per occurrence of million for losses incurred during the policy period  and the healthcare insurance corporation had a self insured retention of million per occurrence above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
retentions may be lower for hospitals in states with patient compensation funds 
in each case  the next million of claims in excess of million are reinsured by the healthcare insurance corporation with independent reinsurance companies 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies from major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to an aggregate limit of million 
any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital 
in addition to the reserves recorded by our captive insurance subsidiaries  we maintain reserves  including reserves for incurred but not reported claims  for our self insured professional liability retentions and claims in excess of the policies aggregate limits  based on actuarial estimates of losses and related expenses 
also  we provide letters of credit to our insurers  which can be drawn upon under certain circumstances  to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under a selected number of our professional and general liability insurance programs

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control that may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations 
if one or more of the events discussed in the following risks were to occur  actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements we make in this report or our other filings with the sec  and our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also negatively affect our business and operations 
in either case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
if we are unable to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms  or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenue from our continuing general hospitals during the year ended december  was billion  which represented approximately of our total net patient revenues from continuing general hospitals 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
at december   approximately of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
it would harm our business if we were unable to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms 
any material reductions in the payments that we receive for our services  coupled with any difficulties in collecting receivables from managed care payers  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in the medicare and medicaid programs or other government health care programs could have an adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net patient revenues from our continuing general hospitals were received from the medicare program  and approximately of our net patient revenues from our continuing general hospitals were received from various state medicaid programs  in each case excluding medicare and medicaid managed care programs 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements  funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements  among other things  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited or if we  or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals  are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business continues to be adversely affected by a high volume of uninsured and underinsured patients 
like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans 
the discounting components of our compact with uninsured patients have reduced our provision for doubtful accounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  but they are not expected to mitigate the net economic effects of treating uninsured or underinsured patients 
we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts  and  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and competition is one reason for our recent declines in patient volumes 
a number of factors affect patient volumes and  thereby  our results of operations at our hospitals and related health care facilities  including the influence of local health care competitors 
generally  other hospitals in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals 
some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not for profit organizations 
tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
in certain states  including california  some not for profit hospitals are permitted by law to directly employ physicians while for profit hospitals are prohibited from doing so 
we also face increasing competition from physician owned specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery  diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
if competing health care providers are better able to attract more patients  recruit and retain physicians  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  we may continue to experience a decline in patient volume levels 
our business and financial condition could be harmed if we are not able to attract and retain employees  physicians and other health care professionals  and our labor costs continue to be adversely affected by union activity and the shortage of nurses 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of our employees and the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no long term contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain skilled employees and an appropriate number of quality physicians and other health care professionals in all specialties on our medical staffs 
in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians are experiencing in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
in some of our markets  we have not been able to attract physicians to our medical staffs at a rate to offset the physicians relocating or retiring 
we believe this physician attrition is one of the reasons for our recent volume declines 
if we are unable to attract new physicians or build stronger relationships with the physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals  we expect these volume declines to continue 
in general  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that adversely affect our labor costs include union activity  the nationwide shortage of nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities were represented by labor unions  and we and the hospital industry in general are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
further  the national nursing shortage continues and remains more serious in key specialties and in certain geographic areas than others  including several areas in which we operate hospitals 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
in response to these trends  we have enhanced salaries  wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future union activity or the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience significant salary  wage and benefit pressures 
in addition  we have been and may continue to be required to increase our use of temporary personnel  which is typically more expensive than hiring full time or part time employees 
our licensed hospital beds are heavily concentrated in certain market areas in florida  california and texas  which makes us sensitive to economic  regulatory  environmental and other developments in those areas 
as of december   the largest concentrations of licensed beds in our general hospitals were in florida  california and texas 
such concentrations increase the risk that  should any adverse economic  regulatory  environmental or other developments occur in these areas  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
specifically  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event could affect us more significantly than other companies with less geographic concentration 
in the recent past  hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in florida and texas  as well as in louisiana  and the patient populations in those states 
our california operations could be adversely affected by a major earthquake or wildfires in that state 
moreover  we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million unadjusted for inflation to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations for hospitals 
our business and financial results could be harmed by violations of existing regulations or compliance with new or changed regulations 
our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to  among other things  licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex  and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  we could be subject to penalties or liabilities or required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our operations have not been profitable for the last several years  and  if our turnaround strategy is not successful  our business operations and financial results may not improve and could worsen 
we reported losses from continuing operations for the years ended december  through these results of operations reflect the challenges we have faced in restructuring our business to focus on a smaller group of general hospitals 
we have been executing a turnaround strategy designed to improve profitability and margins through initiatives to grow volumes  maintain adequate reimbursement levels and control costs 
however  our turnaround timeframe has been impacted by industry trends such as bad debt levels and a company specific volume challenge  which continue to negatively affect our revenue growth 
if our turnaround strategy is not successful or the industry trends worsen  we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability 
trends affecting our actual or anticipated results may lead to charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of the various factors that affect our industry generally and our business specifically  we have been required to record charges in our results of operations 
based on future financial trends and the possible impact of negative trends on our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we will incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
any such charges could adversely affect our results of operations 
our substantial leverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total long term debt  as well as approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  which is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals 
in addition  from time to time  we expect to engage in various capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
our leverage and debt service obligations could have important consequences to an investor  including the following our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain  and any future debt obligations may contain  covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and sell assets 
if we do not comply with these obligations  it may cause an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately 
we may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business  in the health care industry  in the economy generally or if federal or state governments set further limitations on reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs 
we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at economically acceptable interest rates and other terms to meet our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  the payment of judgments or settlements  or general corporate purposes 
we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  which could reduce the amount of funds available for our operations

v 
tenet healthcare corporation  et al  case no 
cv rjk cwx us district court for the central district of california  filed june  in june  four purported tenet shareholders who opted out of the settlement of the federal securities class action lawsuit entitled in re tenet healthcare corporation securities litigation filed a civil complaint in the us district court for the central district of california against the company  certain former executive officers of the company and kpmg llp kpmg  the company s former independent registered public accounting firm 
plaintiffs assert substantively the same factual allegations concerning tenet s receipt and disclosure of medicare outlier payments that were asserted in the federal securities class action lawsuit 
specifically  plaintiffs allege the following claims that the company  kpmg and former executives jeffrey barbakow  david dennis and thomas mackey are liable for securities fraud under section b of and rule b under the exchange act  and that defendants jeffrey barbakow  david dennis  thomas mackey  raymond mathiasen  barry schochet and christi sulzbach are liable for control person liability pursuant to section a of the exchange act 
plaintiffs seek an undisclosed amount of compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses 
tenet and each of the individual defendants filed answers to plaintiffs complaint in september the parties are currently engaged in discovery 
wage and hour actions in september  the court granted our petition to coordinate two pending proposed class action lawsuits  mcdonough  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation and tien  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation  in los angeles superior court 
the mcdonough case was originally filed in june in san diego superior court  and the tien case was originally filed in may in los angeles superior court 
plaintiffs in both cases allege that our hospitals violated certain provisions of the california labor code and applicable california industrial welfare commission wage orders with respect to meal breaks  rest periods and the payment of one hour s compensation for meal breaks or rest periods not taken 
the complaint in the tien case also alleges that we have improperly rounded off time entries on timekeeping records and that our pay stubs do not include all information required by california law 
plaintiffs in both cases are seeking back pay  statutory penalties and attorneys fees  and have filed motions to certify these actions on behalf of virtually all nonexempt employees of our california subsidiaries 
we opposed class certification because we believe our uniform policies comply and have complied with the applicable labor code and wage orders 
our policies are intended to ensure that employees who miss a rest period or meal break on any given day are appropriately paid  and our rounding off practices and pay stubs comply with california law 
in addition  we argued that each of these claims should be addressed individually based on its particular facts and  therefore  should not be subject to class certification 
we are awaiting the court s ruling on class certification in both the mcdonough and tien cases 
two other matters filed as proposed class actions pagaduan v 
fountain valley regional medical center  filed in orange county superior court  and falck v 
tenet healthcare corporation  pending in us district court for the central district of california involve allegations regarding unpaid overtime 
these lawsuits allege that our pay practices since for california based hour shift employees violate california and  in the falck case  federal overtime laws by virtue of the alleged failure to include certain payments known as flexible or california differential payments in the regular rate of pay that is used to calculate overtime pay 
these payments are made to hour shift employees when they do not work a shift that is exactly hours 
we contend that these differential payments need only be included in the regular rate of pay when they actually are paid as opposed to merely being potentially payable  and that they always are included in the regular rate calculation in these circumstances 
plaintiffs in both cases are seeking back pay  statutory penalties and attorneys fees 
in february  the los angeles superior court ruled that the pagaduan case be coordinated with the previously coordinated mcdonough and tien cases already pending there  as described above 
we are now defending these wage and hour cases in a single court 
on february   the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the pagaduan case 
separately  the falck case  which was first provisionally certified as a collective action under the federal fair labor standards act for the purpose of giving notice to potential class members  was certified as a class action for all purposes on february  internal revenue service disputes from time to time  we are engaged in disputes with the internal revenue service regarding our federal tax returns

ep ca kc us district court for the western district of texas in april  we filed a motion for summary judgment in this qui tam action in which the relators continued to allege that tenet hospitals in el paso  texas violated the federal false claims act through the alleged manipulation of the hospitals charges in order to increase outlier payments

brockovich  on behalf of the united states of america v 
tenet healthcare corporation  et al  case no 
cv doc mlgx us district court for the central district of california plaintiff erin brockovich  purportedly on behalf of the united states of america  filed a civil complaint in los angeles superior court in june  alleging that tenet and several of our subsidiaries inappropriately received reimbursement from medicare for treatment given to patients whose injuries were caused by the company and those subsidiaries as a result of medical error or neglect 
this matter is one of approximately identical lawsuits that plaintiff brockovich has filed against most of the major hospital systems and nursing homes in california 
in addition  her attorneys have filed similar cases in new jersey and florida using others as plaintiffs 
in this case  plaintiff is seeking damages of twice the amount that defendants were allegedly obligated to pay or reimburse medicare in connection with the treatment in question  plus interest  together with plaintiff s costs and fees  including attorneys fees 
in july  defendants removed the case to federal court and  in august  filed a motion to dismiss the matter 
in november  defendants motion to dismiss was granted on the basis that plaintiff brockovich lacks constitutional standing 
plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of her intention to appeal the dismissal 
in january  the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit consolidated all of the brockovich matters pending before it and set the briefing schedule for the appeal

civil lawsuits involving real property university of southern california v 
usc university hospital  inc  et al  case no 
bc los angeles superior court  filed august  in august  the university of southern california filed a lawsuit in los angeles superior court against a tenet subsidiary seeking to terminate a ground lease and a development and operating agreement between the university and our subsidiary  which built  owns and operates usc university hospital  an acute care hospital located on land leased from the university in los angeles 
the university s complaint alleged that the lease and operating agreement should be terminated as a result of a default by our subsidiary and sought a judicial declaration terminating the agreements in an effort to force our subsidiary to sell the hospital to the university 
we strongly dispute the university s claims and sought to compel arbitration of the matter as we believe is mandated by the development and operating agreement 
in december  the trial court denied our motion to compel arbitration  and that decision was upheld by an appellate court in august the case returned to the trial court in november the university has filed an amended complaint  which modifies its claims to permit rather than require the university to terminate the lease and operating agreement upon a finding of default 
we moved to dismiss and  in the alternative  moved to strike portions of the university s amended complaint 
we also filed a cross complaint on november   asserting claims against the university for breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment  and declaratory relief 
the university moved to dismiss our cross complaint 
at a hearing held on february   the court denied all of the pending motions

v 
health care property investors  inc  et al  case no 
bc los angeles superior court  filed may  through wholly owned subsidiaries  we lease certain hospital facilities and real estate from health care property investors  inc hcpi  a real estate investment trust  or one of its affiliates 
the properties leased include the tarzana  california campus of encino tarzana regional medical center 
the tarzana lease is scheduled to expire in february in january  we announced our intention to divest both the encino and tarzana campuses of encino tarzana regional medical center  among other hospitals 
in connection with these planned divestitures and the tarzana lease expiration  the company and hcpi began reviewing opportunities for early termination or sale and assignment of the tarzana lease and certain deferred maintenance issues 
in april  we received letters from hcpi alleging that certain of our subsidiaries were in default primarily with respect to several deferred maintenance issues under three leases with hcpi or one of its affiliates that relate to the following hospitals the tarzana campus of encino tarzana regional medical center  community hospital of los gatos  also in california  and northshore regional medical center in slidell  louisiana 
we believe that the alleged defaults are without merit 
however  we are taking steps to clarify or remedy any proven claimed deficiencies  as appropriate  and  if found to be deficient  we intend to elect our right to cure any maintenance defaults as provided under the leases 
in may  our subsidiaries filed suit in california state court against hcpi and certain of its affiliates asserting various causes of action concerning the lease disputes 
our subsidiaries also initiated an arbitration action against hcpi and one its affiliates 
with the lawsuit and through the arbitration proceedings  we seek declaratory relief in our favor regarding the leases and alleged defaults  damages  and injunctive relief and restitution under california s unfair competition law 
some of our subsidiaries leases with hcpi contain cross default covenants that state that  under certain circumstances  one subsidiary may be considered to be in default under its lease with hcpi if a default has occurred and is continuing under one of the other leases 
in july  we received notices from hcpi alleging that certain of our subsidiaries were in default under leases relating to four of our hospitals because of the alleged defaults under the tarzana lease described above 
as a result  hcpi demanded that we turn over possession of irvine regional hospital medical center in california  palm beach gardens medical center in florida  north fulton regional hospital in georgia and frye regional medical center in north carolina by december  we believe hcpi took this step as a response to the lawsuit and arbitration proceedings we commenced in may in september  our subsidiaries subject to hcpi s cross default notices joined the suit in california state court as plaintiffs 
the complaint for these subsidiaries seeks a judicial declaration that no defaults exist under the leases relating to the four hospitals listed above  as well as damages 
in october  hcpi filed a motion to dismiss our subsidiaries amended complaint  which the court denied on november  hcpi has also filed cross claims in the pending california state court proceeding against us and our subsidiaries seeking damages for breach of contract  declaratory relief  specific performance and other relief based on the alleged defaults and cross defaults already at issue in the case 
hcpi s affiliate also filed cross claims in the pending arbitration proceedings  seeking damages for breach of contract 
the case and arbitration proceedings are in their discovery phases 
the california state court litigation is currently set for trial in october  and the hearings in the arbitration proceedings are currently expected to take place after october the parties to the california state court litigation and the arbitration proceedings are currently engaged in settlement discussions that could resolve the parties disputes 
there are no assurances such a settlement will be consummated 
we dispute the defenses and claims of hcpi and its affiliate and  in the event a settlement between the parties is not consummated  we will continue to pursue our claims against hcpi and its affiliate 
medical malpractice and other ordinary course matters in addition to the matters described above  our hospitals are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
the largest category of these relates to medical malpractice 
three medical malpractice cases were filed as purported class action lawsuits and involve former patients of memorial medical center and lindy boggs medical center in new orleans 
in each case  family members allege  on behalf of themselves and a purported class of other patients and their family members  damages as a result of injuries sustained during hurricane katrina 
in addition to disputing the merits of the allegations in these suits  we contend that certification of a class in these actions is not appropriate and that each of these cases must be adjudicated independently 
we will  therefore  oppose class certification and vigorously defend the hospitals in these matters

we are dedicated to improving our patients  shareholders and other stakeholders confidence in us 
we believe we will accomplish that by providing quality care and generating positive growth and earnings at our hospitals 
key developments include the following sale of north ridge medical center in february  we signed a definitive agreement to sell north ridge medical center in fort lauderdale  florida

union agreements during  we entered into new collective bargaining agreements with two labor unions that cover employees at certain hospitals in california and florida 
the agreements set stable and competitive wage increases and provide for greater predictability with respect to union organizing efforts 
we also entered into separate peace accords that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize our employees 
in addition  we entered into a labor contract for nurses represented at four of our hospitals in california

expiration of lease to operate two hospitals in august  our lease agreement with the metrocrest hospital authority the authority expired  and we ceased to operate rhd memorial medical center and trinity medical center  both in the dallas  texas area 
we had previously disclosed that another company had been selected to manage these two hospitals after the expiration of our lease 
it is our understanding that the authority has not yet finalized the selection of an operator to manage the hospitals on a long term basis 
realignment of regions also in august  we streamlined our regional operating structure to further reduce our administrative overhead costs 
our central northeast region was eliminated  and our hospitals in missouri and tennessee became part of the renamed central region formerly  the texas region 
our two philadelphia hospitals now form a separate market reporting directly to our chief operating officer

in the three months ended december   we recorded an accrual of million as an estimated liability to address the potential resolution of the sec investigation  which we paid in april sale of graduate hospital in march  we announced the completion of the sale of graduate hospital in philadelphia  pennsylvania for pretax proceeds of approximately million  which will be used for general corporate purposes 
significant challenges our june global civil settlement with the federal government and other previously announced settlements have resolved several material threats to our company and should help us move forward in our turnaround strategy 
however  there are still significant challenges  both company specific and industry wide  that will impact the timing of our turnaround 
below is a summary of these items 
company specific volume challenge we believe the reasons for declines in our patient volumes include  but are not limited to  decreases in the demand for invasive cardiac procedures  increased competition  managed care contract negotiations or terminations  population trends in florida  and the impact of our litigation and government investigations 
in addition  we believe the challenges we face in physician recruitment  retention and attrition continue to be a primary contributor to our volume declines 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no long term contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs 
although overall we had a net gain in physicians added to our medical staffs during  in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
in some of our markets  we have not been able to attract physicians to our medical staffs at a rate to offset the physicians relocating or retiring 
we are taking a number of steps to address the problem of volume decline  however  due to the concentration of our hospitals in california  florida and texas  we may not be able to mitigate some factors contributing to volume declines 
one of our initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered around understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
we have also sought to include all of our hospitals in the affected geographic area when negotiating new managed care contracts  which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks 
in addition  we are completing clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve results 
this targeted growth initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations  which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes 
however  the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are more profitable 
our commitment to quality initiative  which we launched in  is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge 
we continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care 
as a result of these efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
we believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction  potentially improving our volumes as a result 
significant industry trends bad debt like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans 
the discounting components of our compact with uninsured patients compact have reduced our provision for doubtful accounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  but they are not expected to mitigate the net economic effects of treating uninsured or underinsured patients 
we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts 
our collection efforts have improved  and we continue to focus  where applicable  on placement of patients in various government programs such as medicaid 
however  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue 
cost pressures labor and supply expenses remain a significant cost pressure facing us as well as the industry in general 
controlling labor costs in an environment of fluctuating patient volumes and increased labor union activity will continue to be a challenge 
also  inflation and technology improvements are driving supply costs higher  and our efforts to control supply costs through product standardization  bulk purchases and improved utilization are constantly challenged 
results of operations overview our turnaround timeframe has been and continues to be influenced by company specific challenges and industry trends  including decreasing volumes  declining demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt  that continue to negatively affect our revenue growth and operating expenses 
we believe our future profitability will be achieved through volume growth  appropriate reimbursement levels and cost control across our portfolio of hospitals 
in order to disclose trends using data comparable to the prior year  operating statistics throughout management s discussion and analysis are presented on a same hospital basis  where noted  and exclude the results of coastal carolina medical center  which we have not owned for a full months 
below are some of these statistics and financial highlights for the years ended december  and results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  same hospital net inpatient revenue per patient day and per admission increased by and  respectively  primarily due to the effect of higher negotiated levels of reimbursement under our managed care contracts  partially offset by same hospital patient days and admissions that were down and  respectively 
same hospital net outpatient revenue per visit increased  while same hospital outpatient visits declined 
the increase in revenue per visit is primarily due to the effect of higher negotiated levels of reimbursement under our managed care contracts 
the decline in outpatient visits is primarily due to increased competition 
favorable net adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances  primarily attributable to medicare and medicaid  were million in compared to million in loss per share from continuing operations was in compared to in results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net inpatient revenue per patient day and per admission increased by and  respectively  primarily due to the effect of higher negotiated levels of reimbursement under our managed care contracts  partially offset by additional discounts under the compact during the phase in process 
patient days were down and admissions were down from net outpatient revenue per visit increased  while outpatient visits declined 
the increase in revenue per visit is primarily due to higher medicare and medicaid reimbursement and the effect of higher negotiated levels of reimbursement under our managed care contracts  partially offset by additional discounts under the compact during the phase in process 
loss per share from continuing operations of in increased from the loss per share of in primarily due to litigation settlements and impairments in the table below shows the pretax and after tax impact on continuing operations for each of the three years ended december   and of the following items years ended december  expense income change in prior year liability estimates for retirement plans impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs litigation and investigation costs loss from early extinguishment of debt pretax impact deferred tax asset valuation allowance and other tax adjustments total after tax impact diluted per share impact of above items diluted loss per share  including above items liquidity and capital resources overview net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to payments for legal settlements that were million lower in and net income tax refunds of million received in compared to net income tax payments of million in  partially offset by million of insurance recoveries received in the remaining decrease of million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the timing of various other payables and receivables 
purchases of property and equipment were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  in  we spent approximately million to purchase a hospital in south carolina and million for construction of hospitals in el paso  texas and mt 
pleasant  south carolina 
in  we bought out the joint venture interest of a discontinued operation and purchased certain real estate from the joint venture partner for million and spent million on construction costs for the el paso hospital 
proceeds from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations during the years ended december  and aggregated million and million  respectively 
in  we also received proceeds of million from our investment in metrocrest hospital authority bonds essentially  the source of these proceeds was our final payment of million under our lease agreement with the authority to operate two hospitals in the dallas  texas area and million from the cash surrender value or basis reduction of certain life insurance policies 
in addition  in we received million of insurance recoveries for hurricane related property damage 
in  we received million in insurance proceeds for property damage caused by hurricanes in addition to the million of insurance recoveries received during for business interruption and other hurricane related costs million in total 
in november  we entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility that replaced our million letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals  and bears interest at our option based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points or citigroup s base rate  as defined in the credit agreement  plus basis points 
at december   there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
in addition  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowing capacity of million under our revolving credit facility as of december  we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenue we receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources  primarily managed care payers and the federal medicare program  as well as state medicaid programs  indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement 
the table below shows the sources of net patient revenues on a same hospital basis  expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources years ended december  net patient revenues from medicare medicaid managed care governmental managed care commercial indemnity  self pay and other our payer mix on same hospital admissions basis  expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources  is shown below years ended december  admissions from medicare medicaid managed care governmental managed care commercial indemnity  self pay and other the increase in managed care governmental admissions since is primarily due to an overall shift in our patient mix from medicare and medicaid to managed medicare and managed medicaid as further discussed below 
government programs the medicare program  the nation s largest health insurance program  is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the us department of health and human services hhs 
medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals years of age and older  certain younger people with disabilities  and people with end stage renal disease  and is provided without regard to income or assets 
medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources  and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments 
medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nation s poor and most vulnerable individuals 
these government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited  or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
medicare medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits 
one option  the original medicare plan  is a fee for service payment system 
the other option  called medicare advantage  includes managed care  preferred provider organization  private fee for service and specialty plans 
the major components of our net patient revenues for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below years ended december  revenue descriptions diagnosis related group operating diagnosis related group capital outlier outpatient disproportionate share direct graduate and indirect medical education other adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances total medicare net patient revenues the other revenue category includes skilled nursing facilities  inpatient psychiatric facilities  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  one prospective payment system pps exempt cancer hospital  one long term acute care hospital  other revenue adjustments  and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances 
a general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan is provided below 
recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their effect on our revenues can be found beginning on page acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system diagnosis related group payments sections d and g of the social security act the act set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system 
under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps  medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge 
discharges are classified according to a system of medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups ms drgs  which group patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources 
cms assigns to each ms drg a relative weight that represents the average resources required to care for cases in that particular ms drg  relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all ms drgs 
the base payment amount for the operating component of the ms drg payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share 
both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted by geographic variations in labor and capital costs 
these base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the ms drg assigned to each case 
although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials  the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospital s operating and capital costs 
the ms drg operating and capital base rates are updated annually  giving consideration to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals 
outlier payments outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals for treating medicare patients who are costlier to treat than the average patient in the same ms drg 
to qualify as a cost outlier  a hospital s billed charges  adjusted to cost  must exceed the payment rate for the ms drg by a fixed threshold established annually by cms 
the medicare fiscal intermediary calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospital s most recent filed cost report 
if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the ms drg payment plus the fixed threshold  the hospital receives of the difference as an outlier payment 
under the act  cms must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all pps hospitals to be not less than nor more than of total ms drg payments outlier percentage 
the outlier percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of ms drg and outlier payments 
cms annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit 
a change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments  and the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify 
disproportionate share payments if a medicare participating hospital serves a disproportionate share of low income patients  as determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by cms  it receives a percentage add on to the ms drg payment for each case 
this percentage varies  depending on several factors that include the percentage of low income patients served 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for disproportionate share payments 
direct graduate and indirect medical education the medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions 
this additional reimbursement  which is subject to certain limits  including intern and resident full time equivalent fte limits established in  is made in the form of direct graduate medical education gme and indirect medical education ime payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments 
medicare rules permit hospitals to enter into medicare gme affiliation agreements for the purpose of applying the fte limits on an aggregate basis  and some of our hospitals have entered into such agreements 
we have been contacted by cms in connection with gme fte limits and related reimbursement at doctors medical center in modesto  california as a result of our acquisition of a county owned hospital in modesto 
we have annually collected approximately million of gme reimbursement related to this matter 
we replied to cms that  based on our analysis of the transaction and the applicable cms rules  we believe that the gme fte limits and related reimbursement reported on the hospital s cost report were substantially correct 
in january  cms preliminarily advised us that they disagree with our analysis 
we have not received formal notification of cms determination in this regard and are continuing discussions with cms 
however  if we receive an adverse determination from cms on this matter  it could result in a material charge to our future results of operations  and it could have a material impact on our cash flows in a future quarter 
hospital outpatient prospective payment system under the outpatient prospective payment system  hospital outpatient services  except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule  are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications apcs 
services in each apc are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require  and a payment rate is established for each apc 
depending on the services provided  hospitals may be paid for more than one apc for an encounter 
cms periodically updates the apcs and annually adjusts rates paid for each apc 
inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system effective january   cms implemented a new system of reimbursement for hospital inpatient psychiatric services to replace a cost based payment system 
the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system ipf pps applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system 
the ipf pps includes several provisions to ease the transition to the new payment system 
for example  cms is phasing in the ipf pps for existing hospitals and units over a three year period to avoid disrupting the delivery of inpatient psychiatric services 
full payment under the ipf pps will be entirely phased in by the beginning of the fourth cost reporting year that begins after january  all of our hospitals will have been transitioned to the irf pps by june  the ipf pps  which is based on prospectively determined per diem rates  includes a stop loss provision to protect providers against significant losses during the transition period  and an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases 
inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment system rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by cms are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf under the irf prospective payment system irf pps 
payments under the irf pps are made on a per discharge basis 
a patient classification system is used to assign patients in irfs into case mix groups 
the irf pps uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups 
prior to july   a rehabilitation hospital or unit was eligible for classification as an irf if it could show that  during its most recent month cost reporting period  it served an inpatient population of whom at least percent required intensive rehabilitation services for the treatment of one or more of ten specific conditions 
this became known as the percent rule 
on may   cms released a final rule entitled medicare program  changes to the criteria for being classified as an inpatient rehabilitation facility that revised the medical condition criteria rehabilitation hospitals and units must meet 
this rule also replaced the percent rule compliance threshold with a three year transition compliance threshold of  and for years one  two and three  respectively  then a return to in year four  commencing with cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  the three year transition period was later delayed by one year  then was permanently set at in see regulatory and legislative changes below 
as of december   our inpatient rehabilitation hospital and all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required compliance threshold 
cost reports the final determination of certain medicare payments to our hospitals  such as disproportionate share  gme  ime and bad debt expense  are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports 
the final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal  and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
for filed cost reports  we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must be filed generally within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
medicaid medicaid programs are funded by both the federal government and state governments 
these programs and the reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year 
estimated payments under various state medicaid programs  excluding state funded managed care medicaid programs  constituted approximately  and of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these payments are typically based on fixed rates determined by the individual states 
we also receive disproportionate share payments under various state medicaid programs 
for the years ended december   and  our revenue attributable to disproportionate share payments and other state funded subsidy payments was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue from disproportionate share payments and other state funded subsidy payments is primarily attributable to additional funding provided by certain states  which was made available in part by additional annual state provider taxes on certain of our hospitals and changes in classification of state programs 
in may  cms issued a final rule  medicaid program  cost limit for providers operated by units of government and provisions to ensure the integrity of the federal state financial partnership  that places limits and restrictions on medicaid reimbursement to safety net hospitals 
because of the congressional moratorium that was included in the federal fiscal year ffy supplemental appropriations act  this final rule cannot take effect before may  the provisions of the rule could materially reduce the amount of medicaid payments we receive in the future 
also in may  cms issued a proposed rule clarifying that the agency would no longer provide federal medicaid matching funds for graduate medical education purposes 
congress responded to the cms proposed rule to end federal support for gme payments by including in the ffy supplemental appropriations act language that places a one year moratorium on any such restriction 
the moratorium will last until may  we cannot predict what action  if any  congress or cms will take on this issue 
further  many states in which we operate are facing budgetary challenges that pose a threat to medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
we expect these challenges to continue 
in particular  announced funding changes will adversely impact our georgia  florida and north carolina hospitals effective january  an estimated million reduction on an annual basis for both traditional medicaid and managed medicaid 
on february   the governor of california approved budget cuts of billion that include across the board reductions to medi cal  the state s medicaid program 
the reductions include payment reductions and deferrals  as well as reductions in coverage 
barring legislative action to further modify the budget  the reductions go into effect on july  based on our understanding of the budget reductions  we do not believe they will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
other proposed funding changes could impact our hospitals in other states  however  at this time  we cannot predict the extent of the impact of other states budget restrictions on our hospitals 
regulatory and legislative changes recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of medicare and medicaid payment systems are provided below 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient prospective payment system under medicare law  cms is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system 
the updates generally become effective october  the beginning of the federal fiscal year 
on august   cms issued the changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and ffy rates final rule 
on september   cms issued a correction notice correction notice that corrects certain technical errors in the final rule 
the final rule and correction notice include the following payment and policy changes a market basket increase of for ms drg operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data hospitals that do not report specified quality measure data will receive an increase of  a two year phase in of ms drgs to replace the former diagnosis related groups drgs for ffy  the relative weights will be a blend of of the drg weight and of the ms drg weight  for ffy  the relative weight will be based on of the ms drg weight  across the board reductions of  and in ffys  and  respectively  to maintain budget neutrality according to cms  these reductions coding and documentation offsets are necessary to offset the effect of changes in coding or the classification of discharges that do not reflect real changes in case mix  an increase in the number of quality measures hospitals will need to report in ffy in order to qualify for the full market basket update in ffy  a increase in the capital federal standard rate  the elimination of the large urban add on adjustment to capital payments  the elimination of the indirect medical education adjustment to capital payments over a three year period  with no reduction in ffy  a reduction in ffy  and a reduction in ffys and thereafter  the continuation of the three year transition to a methodology that assigns relative weights to ms drgs based on cost instead of charges for ffy  the weights will be based on a blend of two thirds cost and one third charges  the implementation of a provision of the deficit reduction act of to prevent hospitals from receiving higher payments ie  outlier payments for the additional costs of treating a patient that acquires a condition including an infection during a hospital stay for ffy  cms identified eight conditions  and a decrease in the cost outlier threshold from  to  according to cms  projected aggregate spending from the reforms will not change 
however  payments will increase for hospitals serving more severely ill patients and decrease for hospitals serving patients who are less severely ill 
cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes will yield an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over million 
this increase includes cms estimate of a increase in anticipated payments resulting from coding and documentation improvements and the coding and documentation offset for ffy described above 
on september   the president signed into law the transitional medical assistance  abstinence education  and qualifying individuals programs extension act of  which includes a measure that reduces the coding and documentation offsets for ffys and by to and  respectively  and requires the secretary of hhs to conduct a look back over those years  estimate what the offsets should have been  and adjust future rates to recapture the estimated excess payments in ffy using the impact percentages in the final rule for hospitals in large urban areas  which did not change in the correction notice  and considering the impact of the subsequent legislative reduction in the coding and documentation offsets  each as applied to our medicare ipps payments for the months ended september   the annual impact on our hospitals may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future ipps payments  including admission volumes  length of stay  case mix and the look back measure described above  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system on april   cms issued a notice of the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility ipf prospective payment system update for the rate year beginning july  ipf pps notice 
the ipf pps notice includes the following payment and policy changes an update to the ipf payment equal to the market basket of  and an increase in the fixed dollar loss threshold amount for outlier payments from  to  at december   of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient psychiatric units 
cms projects that the combined impact of the proposed payment and policy changes will yield an average increase in payments for all ipfs including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals  and an average increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas 
using the urban unit impact percentage as applied to our medicare ipf payments for the months ended june   the annual impact of all changes on our psychiatric units may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future ipf payments  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system on july   cms issued the final rule for the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system for ffy irf pps rule 
the irf pps rule includes the following payment and policy changes an update to the irf payment rate equal to the market basket of  a continuation of the phase in to a compliance threshold  which when fully phased in requires that at least of an irf s total inpatient population have one of the designated medical conditions for which intensive inpatient rehabilitation services are medically necessary  and an increase in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from  to  in december  the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of permanently set at the threshold for rehabilitation hospitals and units to qualify as irfs 
the act also requires the continued the use of comorbidities in the determination of compliance  which use was set to expire on july  in order to fund these changes  the irf pps market basket update to the payment rate for ffy  which effective october  is  will be reduced to zero effective april  and will remain frozen at zero through ffy because our hospitals are currently meeting the threshold  only the market basket rate freeze will impact our revenues in ffy the rate reduction effective april  will likely negate any expected annual increase from the final rule 
payment and policy changes to the medicare outpatient prospective payment system on november   cms issued the final changes to the hospital outpatient prospective payment system and calendar year payment rates opps final rule 
the opps final rule includes the following payment and policy changes a inflation update in medicare payment rates for hospital outpatient services paid under the outpatient prospective payment system opps  a requirement for hospitals to begin reporting seven hospital outpatient quality measures in in order to receive their full payment update in in  hospitals that fail to report data for those measures would receive a reduction in their payment update  and an increase in the size of the opps payment bundles and the creation of composite apcs that would provide one bundled payment for several major services 
cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the opps final rule will yield an average increase in payments for all hospitals  and an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over one million 
according to cms estimates  the projected annual impact of the final payment and policy changes for our hospitals is approximately million  an increase of 
because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future opps payments  including volumes and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
long term care hospitals cms issued a final rule for long term care hospitals on may  that provides for a increase in the payment rate  increases the fixed outlier threshold from  to  and revises the payment methodologies for short stay outliers 
the rule also extends the existing cap on admissions for long term care units within hospitals to all long term care hospitals such that more than of a hospital s admissions from a single source will be paid at the lower ipps rate 
however  in december  the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act froze the final rule s payment rate for ffy at the ffy level effective april   rescinded the rule s payment methodology changes for short stay outliers and placed a three year moratorium on the application of the cap on long term acute care hospitals 
we operate one long term care hospital  but we cannot predict the impact the final rule might have on our medicare net revenues from that hospital because of the restrictions imposed on the rule by the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act 
cms medicare value based purchasing program report congress  through section b of the deficit reduction act of  authorized the secretary of hhs to develop a plan to implement value based purchasing vbp commencing in ffy for medicare hospital services paid under the ipps 
by statute  the plan must include consideration of the development and selection of measures of quality and efficiency in inpatient settings  reporting  collection and validation of quality data  the structure  size and source of value based payment adjustments  and disclosure of information on hospital performance 
on november   cms issued a report to congress with its plan to implement a vbp program 
in the report  cms proposes to transform medicare from a passive payer of claims to an active purchaser of care 
the options in the report build on the foundation of the current program of reporting hospital quality data for the annual payment update  which ties a portion of the ipps annual payment update to a hospital meeting certain requirements  including reporting on a defined set of inpatient quality measures 
under cms proposal  its vbp program would phase out those requirements and would make a portion of a hospital s payments contingent on actual performance on specified measures  rather than simply on the hospital s reporting data for these measures 
under vbp  payments to high performing hospitals would be larger than those to lower performing hospitals because the ipps would be used to provide financial incentives to drive improvements in clinical quality  patient centeredness and efficiency 
public reporting of performance on medicare s hospital compare website  a key component of the current reporting program  would remain an essential component of vbp 
we cannot predict what action congress or cms may take with respect to the development or implementation of a vbp program  nor can we predict at this time what impact  if any  a vbp program might have on our results of operations or cash flows 
medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of the state children s health insurance program provides health insurance to poor children 
schip is jointly financed  under the provisions of the social security act  by federal and state governments and administered by the states 
within broad federal guidelines  each state determines the design of its program  eligibility groups  benefit packages  payment levels for coverage  and administrative and operating procedures 
schip provided a capped amount of funds to states on a matching basis through september   when it expired 
the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of  which was signed into law on december   extends funding through march  medicare recovery audit contractor rac initiative section of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of directs the secretary of hhs to demonstrate the use of racs under cms medicare integrity program in identifying underpayments and overpayments under the medicare program  and recouping those overpayments 
racs are third party organizations under contract with cms  and the law provides that compensation paid to each rac be based on a percentage of overpayment recoveries identified by the rac 
in  cms selected three states california  florida and new york to pilot its rac initiative 
our hospitals in california and florida were initially excluded from the program because our fiscal intermediary is not located in the demonstration states 
in  cms added three states arizona  massachusetts and south carolina to the demonstration  and included hospitals served by our fiscal intermediary in the demonstration 
the rac demonstration is slated to end in march  however  section of the tax relief and health care act of makes the rac program permanent and instructs cms to use racs to identify medicare underpayments and overpayments nationwide by in november  cms released the revised rac statement of work sow 
the sow includes several improvements  including placing certain restrictions on the claims subject to review by the racs  and it delays implementation of the rac program in some states 
several of our hospitals have received notices of overpayments resulting from rac reviews 
the overpayment determinations are subject to reconsideration and appeal through various forums  and we will pursue the reversal of the determinations where appropriate  however  we cannot predict the outcome of the appeals 
in addition to overpayments identified by the racs that are not reversed  we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials 
we cannot predict the impact of future rac reviews on our results of operations or cash flows 
medpac recommendations the medicare payment advisory commission medpac is an independent congressional agency established by the balanced budget act of to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program 
the commission s statutory mandate is quite broad  in addition to advising congress on payments to private health plans participating in medicare and providers in medicare s traditional fee for service program  medpac is also tasked with analyzing access to care  quality of care and other issues affecting medicare 
on january   medpac commenced a two day public meeting to address ongoing medicare issues and policy questions 
their recommendations affecting hospital payments include the following congress should increase payment rates for the acute inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems in by the projected rate of increase in the hospital market basket index  congress should reduce the ime adjustment in by to per increment in the resident to bed ratio  and the funds obtained by reducing the ime adjustment should be used to fund a quality incentive payment program  and the update to the payment rates for irf services should be eliminated for ffy we cannot predict what actions  if any  congress or cms may take with respect to medpac s recommendations or what impact those actions may have on our operations 
any actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
ffy budget proposal on february   the white house released its ffy budget proposal  which includes nearly billion in medicare cuts over five years 
the proposed cuts affecting hospitals include a three year market basket freeze for ffys  with an annual reduction to the market basket of thereafter in ffys through for hospital inpatient and outpatient services  as well as irf services  a reduction to capital payments in ffy  a reduction in disproportionate share payments over two years  a reduction of the medicare ime add on percentage from to over three years  implementation of the administration s vbp program over five years  and a phase out of medicare bad debt payments over four years 
most of the budget proposals require congressional action  and we cannot predict what action  if any  congress will take on these proposals 
regulations addressing serious medical events in an effort to encourage hospitals to improve quality of care  the medicare program and certain state medicaid programs have taken steps to reduce or withhold payments to hospitals for treatment given to patients whose conditions were caused by serious medical error 
under rules that go into effect on october   medicare will no longer pay hospitals for the higher costs of care resulting from eight complications  including falls  objects left inside patients during surgery  pressure ulcers and three types of hospital acquired infections 
certain states have established policies or proposed legislation to prohibit hospitals from charging or receiving payment from their medicaid programs for highly preventable adverse medical events sometimes called serious reportable events or never events  which were developed by the national quality forum  a non profit organization that seeks to improve the quality of american healthcare 
these errors include wrong site surgery  serious medication mistakes and discharging a baby to the wrong mother  among others 
in some states  including california  hospitals are required to report certain adverse events to a state agency charged with publicizing the events  as well as the results of any ensuing investigation conducted by the agency 
we believe that our commitment to quality initiative  which utilizes the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care  reduces our exposure to serious reportable events  but we are unable to predict the future impact of this development on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
private insurance managed care we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
hmos generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician  hospital  pharmacy and ancillary service providers that hmo members must access through an assigned primary care physician 
the member s care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the hmo s quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner 
hmos typically provide no benefit or reimbursement to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care 
ppos generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers 
ppo members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit  typically in the form of lower co payments  co insurance or deductibles 
as employers and employees have demanded more choice  managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both hmo and ppo plans 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenue during the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
national payers generate approximately of our total net managed care revenues 
the remainder comes from regional or local payers 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
we expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term 
however  the managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans  which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend 
although we have had ten consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing  we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in the future 
indemnity an indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient  subject to an increasing number of policy conditions and exclusions 
unlike an hmo member  a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers 
self pay patients self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments  such as medicare and medicaid  and who do not have some form of private insurance and  therefore  are responsible for their own medical bills 
a significant portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment 
high acuity treatment is more costly to provide and  therefore  results in higher billings  which are the least collectible of all accounts 
we believe our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors  including reductions in state medicaid budgets  increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance  and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers 
self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients 
further  a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients 
we have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
specifically  pilots for new initiatives to ensure patients are receiving the optimal level of care at the appropriate time in the best setting are being introduced in a few of our hospitals to minimize inappropriate use of our emergency departments for non emergent and non urgent services 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible 
this is just one example of our continuous improvement efforts dedicated to modifying and refining our processes  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
over the longer term  several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge 
for example  our compact is designed to offer managed care style discounts to most uninsured patients  which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges 
a significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts 
under the compact  the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance  which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded 
the uninsured patient accounts  net of contractual allowances recorded  are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process 
we also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive 
most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received  subject to a cap 
except for the per diem amounts  our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  therefore  we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts 
charity care gross charges for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
both the cost of providing these benefits and the forgone revenue under our compact would be substantially less than the gross charge amounts 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following two tables summarize our net operating revenues  operating expenses and operating income loss from continuing operations  both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues  for the years ended december  and years ended december  increase decrease net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses  net depreciation amortization impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs litigation and investigation costs operating income loss years ended december  increase decrease net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses  net depreciation amortization impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs litigation and investigation costs operating income loss net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues  as well as nonpatient revenues primarily rental income  management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias  gift shops and parking and other miscellaneous revenue 
net operating revenues of other operations primarily consist of revenues from physician practices  rehabilitation hospitals and a long term care facility  and equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates that are not directly associated with our general hospitals 
none of our individual hospitals represented more than of our net operating revenues or more than of our total assets  excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables  at december  and net operating revenues from our other operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since  we have seen an increase in revenues from physician practices 
equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  included in our net operating revenues from other operations  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing general hospitals years ended december  increase decrease dollars in millions  except per patient day  per admission and per visit amounts net inpatient revenues net outpatient revenues number of general hospitals at end of period licensed beds at end of period average licensed beds utilization of licensed beds patient days adjusted patient days net inpatient revenue per patient day admissions adjusted patient admissions net inpatient revenue per admission average length of stay days surgeries net outpatient revenue per visit outpatient visits net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues

revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues from continuing operations increased compared to the year ended december  same hospital outpatient visits  surgeries  patient days and admissions were lower during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  by   and  respectively 
we believe the following factors continue to contribute to the overall decline in our inpatient and outpatient volume levels loss of patients to competing health care providers  challenges in physician recruitment  retention and attrition  specifically with respect to recruiting physicians at our florida hospitals to replace doctors who have retired or relocated  strategic reduction of services related to our targeted growth initiative discussed in executive overview significant challenges company specific volume challenge above  a previously disclosed lawsuit filed by the university of southern california  which we believe has negatively impacted volumes at our usc university hospital  population trends in florida  and unfavorable publicity about us  which impacts our relationships with physicians and patients 
our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year 
there were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues 
the positive factors include improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts  favorable net adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances  primarily attributable to medicare and medicaid  of million in compared to million in  and an increase in disproportionate share payments under various states medicaid programs to million in from million in the negative factors include lower overall volumes  particularly at our florida hospitals and usc university hospital in california  and a shift in volume from traditional medicaid to managed medicaid plans 
same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   although overall same hospital outpatient visits decreased in the primary reason for the same hospital net outpatient revenue increase is improved managed care pricing 
salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was flat for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately in compared to the increase is primarily due to merit increases since the prior year and a greater number of employed physicians 
as of december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities were represented by labor unions 
labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory 
we  and the hospital industry in general  are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
as union activity increases at our hospitals  our salaries  wages and benefits expense may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues 
in november  we entered into new collective bargaining agreements with the service employees international union seiu to replace expired collective bargaining agreements at hospitals in california and two hospitals in florida 
we also entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the seiu at coral gables hospital in florida after certain employees voted in favor of union representation at that facility in march the seiu agreements set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations for union represented employees 
in august  we entered into successor  four year collective bargaining agreements with the california nurses association cna that cover nurses at nine hospitals in california 
the cna agreements provide for wage increases within our budgeted expectations 
we have also entered into separate peace accords with both the seiu and the cna that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize our employees 
in march  we reached an agreement with the united nurses associations of california unac on a new labor contract for nurses represented at four hospitals in california 
the unac agreement includes improvements in employee wages  work rules and benefits 
we do not anticipate that any of the union and labor agreements we reached in will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
included in salaries  wages and benefits expense in the year ended december  is million of stock based compensation expense compared to million in the decrease is due to the vesting of higher grant date fair value awards from prior years and the issuance of new awards at lower grant date fair values primarily due to our lower stock price 
supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased slightly for the year ended december  compared to  however  supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased approximately in compared to this increase in supplies expense reflected higher costs for implants and pacemakers due to inflation and technology improvements  partially offset by lower cardiovascular and pharmaceutical supply costs  which resulted from a decrease in cardiovascular procedures and our efforts to use more cost effective pharmaceuticals 
we strive to control supplies expense through product standardization  bulk purchases  contract compliance  improved utilization and operational improvements that should minimize waste 
the items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers  orthopedic implants and high cost pharmaceuticals 
we also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of broadlane  inc  a company in which we currently hold a interest 
broadlane offers group purchasing procurement strategy  outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues increased slightly for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to higher self pay revenues 
the table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer december  december  accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net in millions medicare medicaid cost report settlements commercial managed care governmental managed care self pay uninsured self pay balance after estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agencies other total continuing operations total discontinued operations a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients 
collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus  particularly over the past several years  as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix 
our current estimated collection rate on self pay accounts is approximately  including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors 
this self pay collection rate includes payments made by patients  including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance  prior to an account being classified and assigned to our in house self pay collection group 
the comparable self pay collection percentage as of december  was approximately 
our provision for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of includes a million favorable adjustment in the estimate of necessary bad debt reserve levels at year end primarily related to uninsured patients billings in compared to a favorable adjustment of million in the fourth quarter of the change in anticipated collections as of december  was based on a look back period of months of collections 
we have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
specifically  pilots for new initiatives to ensure patients are receiving the optimal level of care at the appropriate time in the best setting are being introduced in a few of our hospitals to minimize inappropriate use of our emergency departments for non emergent and non urgent services 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible 
this is just one example of our continuous improvement efforts dedicated to modifying and refining our processes  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
payment pressure from managed care payers has also affected our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes  however  we are working with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services 
our current estimated collection rate on managed care accounts is approximately  which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors 
the comparable managed care collection percentage as of december  was approximately 
we continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow 
one specific initiative that was started during the three months ended september  and is expected to be completed in is the center for patient access services  which is a centralized dedicated operation that performs financial clearance  including completing insurance eligibility checks  documenting verification of benefits  providing required notifications to managed care payers  obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling 
although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable 
we manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as total cash collections  point of service cash collections  accounts receivable days outstanding ar days  and accounts receivable aging 
the following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our continuing operations net accounts receivable of billion and billion  excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of million and million  at december  and  respectively december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total our ar days from continuing operations were days at december  and days at december  ar days at december  and are within our target of less than days 
ar days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the relevant quarter divided by our revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter 
as of december   we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house and outside collection agencies or vendors 
these accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts  however  an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts at collection agencies is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable 
patient advocates from our medical eligibility program mep screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs 
they also expedite the process of applying for these government programs 
receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for medicaid are classified as medicaid pending  under our mep  with appropriate contractual allowances recorded 
based on recent trends  approximately of all accounts in our mep are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as medicaid 
the following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our mep  still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at december  and  by aging category december  days days days over days total includes accounts receivable of million at december  and million at december  that are fully reserved 
other operating expenses other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues were for both the years ended december  and other operating expense per adjusted patient day increased approximately in compared to due to higher physician fees  contracted services and information technology services costs 
also included in other operating expenses is malpractice expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to lower patient volume levels  tort reform in several states  and reduced claims experience and ultimate indemnity paid on claims 
also included in other operating expenses in the year ended december  is million in net gains compared to million in net losses in the year ended december  the amount includes an million net gain on the sale of a medical office building in florida  offset by various immaterial losses on sales of equipment 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million  net of insurance recoveries of million  compared to million  net of insurance recoveries of million  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease is lower impairment charges in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail of these charges and related liabilities 
in the second quarter of  we announced several changes to our operating structure 
because of the restructuring of our regions  our goodwill reporting units as defined in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets changed in the second quarter of  requiring us to perform a goodwill impairment evaluation 
based on this evaluation  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million during the three months ended june  based on the estimated fair value of goodwill associated with the reconfigured reporting units 
in addition  as part of our annual impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december  for our former central northeast region due to a lower estimated fair value as a result of adverse industry and company specific challenges that continued to affect our operating results and our anticipated future financial trends  including reduced patient volumes  high levels of bad debt expense related to uninsured and underinsured patients  and continued pressure on labor and supply costs 
we estimated the fair value of the goodwill based on appraisals  established market values of comparable assets  or internal estimates of future net cash flows 
our impairment tests presume stable or  in some cases  improving results in our hospitals 
if these expectations are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we will incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
litigation and investigation costs litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the amount for includes a million increase in the estimated liabilities for wage and hour actions and other unrelated employment matters further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the expenses primarily consisted of legal settlements with the federal government and costs to defend ourselves in various lawsuits 
income tax benefit income taxes in the year ended december  included an income tax benefit of million to reduce our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions  including interest  income tax expense of million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and a state income tax benefit of million  net of federal benefit  to increase deferred tax assets related to state tax credits as a result of enactment of recent legislation 
income taxes in the year ended december  included a million income tax benefit million recorded as a current income tax receivable and million as a non current deferred tax asset to record the tax effects of our global civil settlement with the federal government  the impact of the non deductibility of goodwill impairment charges million unfavorable tax impact on the effective tax rate reconciliation as a result of this permanent difference  income tax expense of million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  including the impact on the valuation allowance of an irs revenue agent s report the rar discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and an income tax benefit of million to reflect changes in our tax contingency reserves  including interest and including the impact of the rar and settlement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following two tables summarize our net operating revenues  operating expenses and operating loss from continuing operations  both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues  for the years ended december  and years ended december  increase decrease net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses  net depreciation amortization impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs litigation and investigation costs loss from early extinguishment of debt operating loss years ended december  increase decrease net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses  net depreciation amortization impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs litigation and investigation costs loss from early extinguishment of debt operating loss none of our individual hospitals represented more than of our net operating revenues or more than of our total assets  excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables  at december  and net operating revenues from our other operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  included in these amounts  were million and million for and  respectively 
the table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing general hospitals years ended december  increase decrease dollars in millions  except per patient day  per admission and per visit amounts net inpatient revenues net outpatient revenues number of general hospitals at end of period licensed beds at end of period average licensed beds utilization of licensed beds patient days adjusted patient days net inpatient revenue per patient day admissions adjusted patient admissions net inpatient revenue per admission average length of stay days surgeries net outpatient revenue per visit outpatient visits net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues 
net inpatient revenues for the years ended december  and include self pay revenues of million and million  respectively 
net outpatient revenues for the years ended december  and include self pay revenues of million and million  respectively 
the change is the difference between and amounts shown 
utilization of licensed beds represents patient days divided by average licensed beds divided by number of days in the period 
adjusted patient admissions days represent actual patient admissions days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient admissions days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
self pay admissions represent and of total admissions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
charity care admissions represent and of total admissions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues from continuing operations increased compared to the year ended december  due to improved managed care pricing  partially offset by lower volumes 
net operating revenues were also impacted by the discounts recorded on self pay accounts under our compact 
total compact discounts  which reduced net operating revenues  for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
outpatient visits  surgeries  patient days and admissions were lower during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  by   and  respectively 
we believe the following factors contributed to the overall decline in our inpatient and outpatient volume levels loss of patients to competing health care providers  challenges in physician recruitment  retention and attrition  strategic reduction of services related to our targeted growth initiative  and unfavorable publicity about us as a result of legacy lawsuits and government investigations  which impacted our relationships with physicians and patients 
our net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year 
there were various positive and negative factors that impacted our net inpatient revenues 
the positive factors include improved managed care pricing as a result of contracts renegotiated in and late  partially offset by a reduction in stop loss payments from million in to million in the improved managed care pricing was also partially offset by an overall shift in our managed care patient mix towards plans with lower levels of reimbursement  including national payers whose contract terms typically generate lower yields  and managed care medicare and medicaid insurance plans  which typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans  and medicaid disproportionate share revenue of million in compared to million in the negative factors include lower patient volumes  including medicare  medicaid and commercial managed care volumes  favorable net adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances  primarily related to medicare and medicaid  in of million  including a favorable adjustment of million as a result of a change in estimate of the valuation allowances necessary for prior year cost report periods not yet audited and settled by our fiscal intermediary  versus a favorable net adjustment in of million  and compact discounts of million in versus million in  which reduced net inpatient revenue 
net outpatient revenues during the year ended december  were flat compared to net outpatient revenues were negatively impacted by the implementation of the compact 
during the year ended december   approximately million in discounts were recorded on outpatient self pay accounts under the compact compared to discounts of million during the year ended december  as previously mentioned  outpatient visits also decreased for the year ended december  compared to the primary reasons for this decrease are lower rehabilitation visits  closures or joint venture arrangements with respect to various outpatient centers  and the increasing competition we are experiencing from physician owned entities providing outpatient services 
the reduction in outpatient ancillary visits  coupled with an increase in emergency room visits and improved managed care pricing  contributed to an overall increase in our net outpatient revenue per visit 
salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately in compared to the increase is primarily due to less effective flexing of staff during volume declines  partially offset by lower overall benefit costs in primarily due to a reduction in the k plan maximum matching percentage from to 
included in salaries  wages and benefits expense in the year ended december  is million of stock compensation expense compared to million in the year ended december  supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was essentially flat for the year ended december  compared to  however  supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased from the increase in supplies expense was primarily attributable to higher pharmaceutical  orthopedic and implants supply costs 
in the case of implants  the higher costs were associated primarily with new products used to provide a higher quality of care to our patients  whereas the higher orthopedic costs primarily reflected inflation of prices 
higher pharmaceutical costs reflected a combination of new products and inflation 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to the implementation of the compact  partially offset by higher levels of uninsured patients 
prior to implementation of the discounting provisions under the compact  the vast majority of these accounts were ultimately recognized to be uncollectible and  as a result  were then recorded in our provision for doubtful accounts 
by offering managed care style discounts  we are charging the uninsured more affordable rates  whereby they may be better able to meet their financial obligations to pay for services we provide them 
the discounts recorded as contractual allowances during the year ended december  were approximately million compared to million in the increase is substantially due to the phasing in of the compact and the fact that compact discounts were in effect at all of our general hospitals in the year ended  whereas in  our hospitals in texas implemented the discounting components of the compact on september  and most of our hospitals in california implemented them effective february  however  we do not expect the compact to have a material effect on the net economic impact of treating self pay patients 
our collection rate on self pay accounts as of december  was approximately  including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors 
the comparable self pay collection percentage as of december  was approximately 
our collection rate on managed care accounts as of december  was approximately 
the comparable managed care collection percentage as of december  was approximately 
in the three months ended june   bad debt expense included a positive adjustment of approximately million to reduce bad debt expense for disputed managed care receivables that were ultimately settled 
as a result of these settlements  contractual allowances in included a corresponding increase that reduced net operating revenues by approximately million 
the following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our continuing operations net accounts receivable of billion and billion  excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of million and million  at december  and  respectively december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total our ar days from continuing operations decreased to days at december  compared to days at december  ar days at december  and are within our target of less than days 
the decrease in ar days reflects improved collections  particularly in our former texas and central northeast regions 
other operating expenses other operating expenses for the years ended december  and were and of net operating revenue  respectively 
the increase is due primarily to increases in fixed costs that do not fluctuate with changes in our patient volumes  such as utilities  property taxes  information technology costs and other contracted services  including physicians fees  that continued to result in a higher operating expense percentage even though revenues increased from to other operating expenses include malpractice expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in is due to lower patient volumes and improved loss development 
also included in other operating expenses in the year ended december  is million in net losses compared to million of net gains in the year ended december  on sales of equipment and other assets 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million  net of insurance recoveries of million 
this compares to impairment and restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail of these charges  reversal of reserves and related liabilities 
litigation and investigation costs litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the expenses were comprised primarily of our june global civil settlement with the federal government million  accruals of minimum liabilities on several other cases  and legal and other costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the expenses consisted primarily of million for the net settlement of a securities lawsuit  million in final settlement of matters related to redding medical center  million to settle several issues with the florida attorney general  and legal and other costs to defend ourselves in other matters  in particular the various federal government investigations 
loss from early extinguishment of debt in connection with the early redemption of senior notes in february  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of debt  representing premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
net gains on sales of facilities and long term investments the million of net gains in the year ended december  related to the sale of an investment and the reduction of reserves associated with hospitals sold in prior years 
the million of net gains in the year ended december  related primarily to the reduction of reserve estimates associated with hospitals sold in prior years 
income tax expense benefit income taxes in the year ended december  included a million income tax benefit million recorded as a current income tax receivable and million as a non current deferred tax asset to record the tax effects of our global civil settlement with the federal government  the impact of the non deductibility of goodwill impairment charges million unfavorable tax impact on the effective tax rate reconciliation as a result of this permanent difference  income tax expense of million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  including the impact on the valuation allowance of the rar discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and an income tax benefit of million to reflect changes in our tax contingency reserves  including interest and including the impact of the rar and settlement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in the year ended december  included income tax expense of million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and an income tax benefit of million to reflect changes in our tax contingency reserves  including interest 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees  are summarized in the table below  all as of december  years ending december  later total years in millions long term debt global civil settlement payable capital lease obligations long term non cancelable operating leases standby letters of credit guarantees asset retirement obligations academic affiliation agreements tax liabilities supplemental executive retirement plan obligations information technology contract services purchase orders total includes interest through maturity date lease termination 
includes minimum revenue guarantees  primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals  and operating lease guarantees 
these agreements contain various rights and termination provisions 
the standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under some of our professional and general liability insurance programs 
the amount of collateral required is principally dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness 
the insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers 
the standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities  including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations  equipment and information systems additions and replacements  introduction of new medical technologies  design and construction of new buildings  and various other capital improvements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year ending december  will total approximately million to million  including million that was accrued in december  but not paid until the anticipated capital expenditures include approximately million in to meet california seismic requirements for our remaining california facilities after all planned divestitures 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations 
this amount has not been adjusted for inflation as there is currently a shortage of supplies  and there is expected to be a limited number of architects  engineers and contractors available to design and perform this work  both of which are causing a high inflation rate at this time 
our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending december  also include approximately million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities  as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit 
we expect to spend a total of approximately million on such improvements over the next four years 
interest payments  net of capitalized interest  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the interest payments included million related to our global civil settlement with the federal government 
we anticipate that our gross interest payments  including capitalized interest  for the year ending december  will be approximately million 
income tax refunds  net of tax payments  were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to approximately million in income tax payments  net of refunds received  in the year ended december  and a net income tax refund of million in the year ended december  at december   our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion expiring in to  approximately million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration  and general business credit carryforwards of approximately million expiring in to sources and uses of cash our liquidity for the year ended december  was primarily derived from cash on hand  marketable securities  proceeds from sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations  income tax refunds  proceeds from the cash surrender value or basis reduction of certain life insurance policies  and cash flow generated from operations 
during  our liquidity was primarily derived from sales of facilities  cash on hand  the release of million of restricted cash in connection with our prior letter of credit agreement  and insurance recoveries 
for the year ended december   our liquidity was primarily derived from proceeds from the sale of new senior notes  cash flows from operating activities  including a net income tax refund of million  sales of facilities and unrestricted cash on hand 
our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable 
as we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients grow  our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to payments for legal settlements that were million lower in and net income tax refunds of million received in compared to net income tax payments of million in  partially offset by million of insurance recoveries received in the remaining decrease of million in net cash provided by operating activities is due to the timing of various other payables and receivables 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million 
the decrease from in cash generated by operations  after considering the net income tax refund of million in compared to net income tax payments of million in  is due primarily to higher payments for litigation settlements  partially offset by million in insurance recoveries in during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the primary contributor was the net income tax refund of million 
in addition  lower payments for restructuring and litigation settlements and reduced operating cash requirements related to discontinued operations contributed to the increase from proceeds from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations during  and aggregated million  million and million  respectively 
in the year ended december   we also received proceeds of million from our investment in metrocrest hospital authority bonds compared to million in the year ended december  essentially  the source of the proceeds was our final payment of million under our lease agreement with the authority to operate two hospitals in the dallas  texas area  million of which is classified as a financing outflow in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
as a result of our review of our balance sheet for efficiencies during  we received million in cash surrender value proceeds or basis reduction of certain life insurance policies 
in addition  in  we received million in insurance recoveries for hurricane related property damage 
in the year ended december   we received million in insurance proceeds for property damage caused by hurricanes in addition to the million of insurance recoveries received during for business interruption and other hurricane related costs million in total 
further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet during could generate incremental cash 
these possible initiatives could include the sale of some or all of our medical office buildings  the recapitalization of broadlane  inc  in which we hold a interest  and the sale of excess land  buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets 
however  such initiatives require significant marketing and negotiation efforts  therefore  the realization of such incremental cash flow cannot be assured 
purchases of property and equipment were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  in the year ended december   we spent approximately million to purchase a hospital in south carolina and million for construction of hospitals in el paso  texas and mt 
pleasant  south carolina 
in the year ended december   we bought out the joint venture interest of a discontinued operation and purchased certain real estate from the joint venture partner for million and spent million on construction costs for the el paso hospital 
in  we replaced our million letter of credit facility with an million senior secured revolving credit facility  which allowed million of cash pledged under the letter of credit facility to be released 
in  net cash proceeds from the sale of new senior notes were million 
we used the proceeds to redeem other long term debt  to retire existing bank loans under our credit agreements at the time and for general corporate purposes 
at december   one of our captive insurance subsidiaries held million of auction rate securities  classified as investments  whose auction failed due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
as of december   we do not believe an other than temporary impairment of these securities has occurred due to their credit ratings at that date of aa by moody s and the expected longer term holding period in our captive insurance subsidiary s investments to be matched with maturing liabilities 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs 
these securities are being analyzed each reporting period for other than temporary impairment factors 
we do not anticipate any future decrease in value of these securities to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  and have no other investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the credit crisis in the sub prime market 
we have not made any repurchases of our common stock since june  we have issued shares to be held by our benefit plan administrator that are reported as treasury shares until released to our employees as a result of restricted stock unit grants  which entitle employees to receive shares of our common stock in the future 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants in november  we entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility that replaced our million letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals  and bears interest at our option based on libor plus basis points or citigroup s base rate  as defined in the credit agreement  plus basis points 
the revolving credit agreement includes a provision  which we believe is customary in receivables backed credit facilities  that gives our banks the right to require that proceeds of collections of substantially all of our consolidated accounts receivable be applied directly to repay outstanding loans and other amounts that are due and payable under the revolving credit facility at any time that unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or if an event of default has occurred and is continuing thereunder 
in that event  we would seek to re borrow under the revolving credit facility to satisfy our operating cash requirements 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to conditions that we believe are customary in such facilities  including that no events of default then exist 
in january  we sold million of senior notes due in in february  with a portion of the net proceeds from that sale  we redeemed the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding on our senior notes due in and as a result  we have no significant long term debt due until december the maturities of over of our long term debt now fall between december and january an additional million of long term debt is not due until the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants and conditions that have  among other requirements  limitations on liens on principal properties and sale and lease back transactions with respect to principal properties 
a principal property is defined in the indentures as a hospital that has an asset value on our books in excess of of our consolidated net tangible assets  as defined 
the above limitations do not apply  however  to debt that is not secured by principal properties or debt that is secured by principal properties if the aggregate of such secured debt does not exceed of our consolidated net tangible assets  as further described in the indentures 
the indentures also prohibit the consolidation  merger or sale of all or substantially all assets unless no event of default would result after giving effect to such transaction 
all of our senior notes are general unsecured senior debt obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness  but are effectively subordinated to the obligations of our subsidiaries and any obligations under our revolving credit facility to the extent of the collateral 
from time to time  we expect to engage in various capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
we believe our existing indentures provide significant flexibility for future collateralized borrowings 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes 
at december   there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
based on our eligible receivables  the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was million at december  we also had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
liquidity we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand  marketable securities  availability under our revolving credit facility  future cash provided by operating activities and anticipated sales proceeds from our hospitals held for sale should be adequate to meet our current cash needs 
these sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures  payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs 
long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities  results of balance sheet initiatives previously discussed and  given favorable market conditions  future borrowings or refinancings 
however  our cash requirements could be materially affected by the deterioration in our results of operations  as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections  which could require us to pursue any number of financing options  including  but not limited to  additional borrowings  debt refinancings  asset sales or other financing alternatives 
the level  if any  of these financing sources cannot be assured 
we are aggressively identifying and implementing further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance  including cash flow 
among the areas being addressed are volume growth  managed care payer contracting  procurement efficiencies  cost standardization  bad debt expense reduction initiatives  underperforming hospitals  and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care 
although these initiatives may result in improved performance  that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios 
off balance sheet arrangements excluding the hospitals whose operating results are included in discontinued operations  our consolidated operating results for each of the years ended december   and include billion of net operating revenue and billion of income from operations generated from eight hospitals operated by us under operating lease arrangements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the respective assets and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the current terms of these operating leases expire between and  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
if these leases expire  we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except for million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of december  shown in the cash requirements table above 
recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use 
in general  we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  given the particular circumstances in which we operate 
actual results may vary from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  and may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions 
our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas recognition of net operating revenues  including contractual allowances  provisions for doubtful accounts  accruals for general and professional liability risks  accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans  accruals for litigation losses  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  asset retirement obligations  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed 
net operating revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates ie  gross charges  less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances  principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans  as well as uninsured patients under the compact 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in earlier periods  and certain other payments  such as disproportionate share  gme  ime and bad debt expense  which are based on our hospitals cost reports  are estimated using historical trends and current factors 
cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review  and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved 
because the laws  regulations  instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently  the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts 
we have a system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements 
this results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports 
for filed cost reports  we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports  and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
these estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursements for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the compact  whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements 
we know of no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
provisions for doubtful accounts although outcomes vary  our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients  including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
generally  as required by emtala  patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay 
therefore  services  including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient  are performed prior to the verification of the patient s insurance  if any 
in non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services  it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated 
we provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital  our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an month look back period  and other relevant factors 
our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable  including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing 
generally  uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency between to days  once patient responsibility has been identified 
when accounts are assigned for collections by the hospital  the accounts are completely written off the hospital s books through the provision for doubtful accounts  and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospital s books at the same time 
the estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates 
the estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our in house collection agency 
managed care accounts are collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices  whereby the account balances remain in the hospital s patient accounting system and on the hospital s books  and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age 
managed care accounts collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years 
changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings 
we aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal  including arbitration and litigation  but we may not be successful 
accruals for general and professional liability risks we accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we maintain reserves  which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks  including incurred but not reported claims  to the extent we do not have insurance coverage 
our estimated liability is based on a number of factors  including the number of asserted claims and reported incidents  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  the timing of historical payments and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from historical trends 
in addition  because of the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
the discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover  and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we increased our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions at our december  measurement date 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease total net periodic pension expense for by million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease net periodic pension expense for by million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
accruals for litigation losses we record reserves for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
under sfas  a loss contingency is recorded if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss 
if a range of loss can be reasonably estimated  but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
these estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we calculate the amount of an impairment if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals  established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
they require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates 
these assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell 
in such circumstances  our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows 
these fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods 
many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates  including the future financial results of our hospitals  how the hospitals are operated in the future  changes in health care industry trends and regulations  and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets 
in certain cases  these fair value estimates assume the highest and best use of the assets in the future to a market place participant is other than as a hospital 
in these cases  the estimates are based on the fair value of the real property and equipment if utilized other than as a hospital 
the impairment recognized does not include the costs of closing the hospital or other future operating costs  which could be substantial 
accordingly  the ultimate net cash realized from the hospital  should we choose to sell it  could be significantly less than its impaired value 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually 
for goodwill  we perform the test at the reporting unit level  as defined by appropriate accounting standards  when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with asset retirements in the period in which it is incurred  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation can be made 
when the liability is initially recorded  we capitalize the cost of the asset retirement obligation by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost associated with the retirement obligation is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the obligation  any difference between the cost to settle the asset retirement obligation and the liability recorded is recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the calculation of the asset retirement obligation is a critical accounting estimate because factors used in calculating the obligation can change  which could result in larger or smaller estimated obligations that could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the significant assumptions and estimates used in the calculation include the following estimated settlement date of the obligation the year when the asset is no longer deemed to have any future useful life  and the facility or asset is closed  or otherwise disposed of  is when final settlement of the obligation is estimated to occur  and is generally based on the remaining years of useful life of our facilities or the expiration of a lease 
changes in demand  competing facilities  economic conditions  technology advancements  state regulations and availability of physicians  nurses and staff can affect the estimated settlement date 
retirement obligation costs these costs are estimated based on our knowledge of the applicable laws and regulations  known facts and circumstances of specific obligations  and cost estimates obtained from our knowledge and past experience 
asbestos presence the estimated amount of asbestos in our facilities was determined by our construction staff based on their knowledge of the architectural state of the facility  the age of the facility and whether any renovation had recently occurred 
due to facilities changing ownership several times and our experience during renovations of inconsistent use of building materials  it cannot be known with certainty the exact amount of asbestos present or the exact location of all asbestos that may need to be remediated 
inflation rate the inflation rate applied to current remediation costs is used to estimate the future value of the remediation costs at the time the retirement obligation is estimated to be settled 
we have assumed an inflation rate of based on the nature of the retirement obligations 
discount rate the estimated costs at the anticipated settlement date are discounted back to the year the asset was built or acquired to determine the amount of the obligation when it was incurred 
the estimate of the initial obligation has been accreted to the current date in accordance with sfas the discount rate represents our credit adjusted  risk free rate of interest  which is estimated to be 
using these estimates and assumptions  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  fixed asset cost  accumulated depreciation and the asset retirement obligation were calculated for each of our facilities that have known asset retirement obligations 
subsequent changes to these assumptions will affect future depreciation and accretion expense 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no

this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels  the availability  or lack thereof  of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits  the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
we consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions  and such judgments are subject to periodic review 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
while we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities in accordance with sfas and fin  adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method required by sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees  directors  advisors and consultants generally is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant date and is recognized over the vesting periods of the awards  whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method recommended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a binomial lattice model 
the key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include expected volatility  expected dividend yield  expected life  expected forfeiture rate  risk free interest rate range  early exercise threshold  and early exercise rate 
the expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options 
the expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options  and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges 
the historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period october  through december  due to unique events occurring during that time  which caused the extreme volatility of our stock price 
the expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding 
this model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price 
the risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon united states treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes 
under sfas  we estimated the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model incorporated our reasoned assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our common stock price  estimated risk free interest rates  and the expected dividend yield  if any  all over the expected lives of the respective options 
we did not adjust the model for non transferability  risk of forfeiture or the vesting restrictions of the option  all of which would reduce the option value if factored into our calculations 
the most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option  because it  in turn  is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates 
accordingly  we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date 
our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of december  the fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments 
at december   we had no borrowings subject to or with variable interest rates 
maturity date  year ending december  thereafter total fair value dollars in millions fixed rate long term debt average interest rates we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
at december   we had long term  market sensitive investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries 
our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as non current assets is substantially mitigated by the long term nature and type of the investments in the portfolio 
at december   we had accumulated unrealized losses of approximately million related to our captive insurance companies investment portfolios 
we have no affiliation with partnerships  trusts or other entities sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements 
thus  we have no exposure to the financing  liquidity  market or credit risks associated with such entities
