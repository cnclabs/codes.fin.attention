executive overview we use problem solving design and innovation to enhance the performance of human habitats worldwide  making our customers lives more productive  rewarding  delightful  and meaningful 
we do this by providing high quality products and related knowledge services 
at present  most of our customers come to us for work environments in both corporate office and healthcare settings 
we also have a growing presence in educational and residential markets  including home office 
our primary products include furniture systems  seating  storage and material handling solutions  freestanding furniture  and casegoods 
our services extend from workplace to furniture asset management 
in fiscal  we introduced teneo tm storage furniture  a system of free standing storage  hosting  and display pieces designed for individual and group work settings 
we extended our reach into the work accessories market in fiscal with the be collection tm  a suite of new products designed to enhance personal comfort  organization  and technology support 
convia tm  our new product and new business launched in fiscal  leads us into the field of modular electrical building systems 
this building infrastructure offering enables building owners and individuals to adapt and control their habitat in new and profound ways 
we are globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations 
in the united states  our manufacturing operations are located in michigan  georgia  and washington 
in europe  we have a significant manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  our largest marketplace outside of the united states 
in asia  we have manufacturing operations in ningbo  china 
our products are sold internationally through wholly owned subsidiaries or branches in various countries including canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  australia  singapore  china  india  and the netherlands 
our products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships 
we have customers in over countries around the globe 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller production system hmps 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
as a result  the rate of our inventory turns is high 
these combined factors could cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low in relation to sales volume 
a key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
our business consists of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how we internally report and evaluate financial information used to make operating decisions and are organized by the various markets we serve 
for external reporting purposes  we aggregate these operating segments as follows 
north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products for office and healthcare environments throughout the united states  canada  and mexico 
non north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products primarily for work related settings outside north america 
other includes our north american residential furniture business as well as other business activities such as convia  and unallocated corporate expenses 
core strengths we rely on the following core strengths in delivering workplace solutions to our customers 
problem solving design and innovation we are committed to developing research based functionality and aesthetically innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research and design staff as well as third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence we were among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
we are committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency 
we have begun to extend this lean process work externally to our manufacturing supply chain and to our distribution channel 
we believe this work holds great promise for further gains in reliability  quality and efficiency 
building and leading networks we value relationships in all areas of our business 
we consider our networks of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among our most important competitive factors and vital to the long term success of our business 
channels of distribution our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services  including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at may   we owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
we believe independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally  the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this in mind  our strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition our owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  our goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  we transitioned one owned dealership in texas to independent ownership status 
the effect of this transaction on the company s consolidated financial statements is not material 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary eg sales to the eg federal government 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
challenges ahead like all businesses  we are faced with a host of challenges and risks 
we believe our core strengths and values  which provide the foundation for our strategic direction  have us well prepared to respond to the inevitable challenges we will face in the future 
while we are confident in our direction  we acknowledge the risks specific to our business and industry 
refer to item a of our annual report on form k for discussion of certain of these risk factors 
future avenues of growth we believe we are well positioned to successfully pursue our mission despite the risks and challenges we face 
that is  we believe we can continue to improve the performance of human habitats worldwide 
in pursuing our mission  we have identified the following as key avenues for our future growth 
primary markets capturing additional market share within our existing primary markets by offering superior solutions to customers who value space as a strategic tool adjacent markets further applying our core skills in environments such as healthcare  higher education  and residential developing economies expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential new markets developing new products and technologies that serve new markets industry analysis the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we monitor the trade statistics reported by bifma and consider them an indicator of industry wide sales and order performance 
bifma publishes statistical data for the contract segment and the office supply segment within the us furniture market 
the us contract segment is primarily with large to mid size corporations installed via a network of dealers 
the office supply segment is primarily to smaller customers via wholesalers and retailers 
we primarily participate  and believe we are a leader in the contract segment 
it is important to note that our diversification strategy lessens our dependence on the us office furniture market 
we also analyze bifma statistical information as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic us business and also to that of our competitors 
the timing of large project based business may affect comparisons to this data 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of many considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions our fiscal years ended may  and june  each included weeks of operations 
by comparison  the year ended june  included weeks of operations 
the extra week was required to bring our fiscal reporting dates in line with the actual calendar months 
we report an additional week of operations in our fiscal calendar approximately every six years for this reason 
although fiscal was a year marked with several challenges and uncertainties  we once again realized many achievements 
we translated modest top line growth into solid improvement in operating income and record earnings per share 
our relentless pursuit of innovative solutions coupled with our strategy to diversify into new and emerging markets both at home and abroad  enabled us to grow despite generally slowing economic activity in certain key markets 
also  our cost control efforts and the timing of cost increases for certain inputs proved to limit our exposure to increasing costs for raw materials and fuel 
our expanded international distribution channel and increased manufacturing presence in china contributed to another double digit increase in sales for our non north american furniture solutions segment 
net sales outside of north america continued to increase as a percentage of our consolidated net sales in fiscal in addition to growing the business overseas  our north american furniture solutions segment posted modest growth for the year 
the acquisition of brandrud furniture  inc brandrud during fiscal contributed to our double digit sales growth to the healthcare industry 
with this acquisition  we expanded our reach into patient rooms  patient treatment areas  and public spaces 
we introduced several new products designed to reach customers in nearly all areas of our business 
these new products made a strong showing at neocon  the contract furniture industry s largest tradeshow 
our newly introduced filing and storage solution  teneo tm  won best of show at neocon and we were named manufacturer of the year by the office furniture dealers association 
in fiscal  we significantly changed our capital structure to better leverage our balance sheet 
we issued million of senior unsecured private placement notes and commenced a million accelerated share repurchase program asr 
prior to the asr  we repurchased approximately million shares 
as a result of the asr  we retired an additional million shares  bringing the full year repurchase count to million shares 
the asr will be completed in september and we expect to retire approximately million additional shares at that time 
we also increased our borrowing capacity with a new million syndicated revolving line of credit 
during the year  we announced several initiatives to improve our operating profitability and enable greater and faster investment in our strategic growth initiatives 
we put in place a restructuring action that eliminated approximately full time positions and we implemented cost reduction activities that boosted operating earnings toward our long term goal of percent of sales 
we are pleased with our performance for the year  and we continue to actively manage our business in a volatile macro economic environment 
looking forward  the general economic outlook for our industry in the us is expected to be negative through calendar year  and we remain appropriately cautious as a result 
bifma issued its most recent report in may and expects that the growth rate of office furniture orders and shipments in the us for the balance of calendar to be negative percent and negative percent  respectively 
for calendar  bifma expects negative percent for both orders and shipments compared to calendar this downturn is primarily the result of tighter credit  pale growth in gdp  concerns over inflation and business confidence which may create a drag on office furniture consumption 
bifma expects that corporate profits will rebound in early and modestly boost office furniture consumption 
financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated 
dollars in millions fiscal chg from fiscal chg from fiscal net sales    cost of sales    gross margin operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense minority interest  net of tax na na net earnings the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal year ended may  june  june  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses design and research expenses total operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal compared to fiscal for the fiscal year ended may   consolidated net sales rose percent to  million from  million in fiscal this year over year growth was driven by strong top line performance across several of our operating units  most notably in the markets that we serve outside of north america 
the weakening of the us dollar during fiscal added approximately million to our top line growth and we realized an increase of million in net sales due to our recent acquisition of brandrud 
in fiscal  we recognized million of net sales to a third party equipment manufacturer oem sales 
the oem sales contract expired at the end of fiscal and accordingly  there were no related sales recorded in fiscal consolidated net trade orders for fiscal totaled  million 
this is comparable to net trade orders of  million last year  and represents an increase of percent 
there was some volatility in our order pacing in fiscal primarily due to uncertainties in the us economy 
we also experience normal seasonality from quarter to quarter due to the timing of orders from the federal government and the december holiday season 
our backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  a percent decline from million at the end of fiscal bifma reported an estimated year over year increase in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  net sales growth for our domestic us business totaled approximately percent 
we believe that while comparisons to bifma are important  we continue to pursue a strategy of revenue diversification that makes us less reliant on the drivers that impact bifma 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales of  million in fiscal year increased million from fiscal this increase of percent was driven by growth within both of our reportable business segments 
the additional week in fiscal added approximately million in net sales to that period 
excluding the impact of this additional week  the year over year growth in net sales between fiscal years and totaled approximately percent 
despite intense price competition in all of our major market areas  we captured approximately million to million of net sales in fiscal as a result of pricing actions 
consolidated net trade orders in fiscal totaled  million representing a year over year growth of percent from orders of  million in fiscal excluding the extra week of operations in the fiscal  order growth was percent between periods 
average weekly order pacing was higher in the first half of fiscal than in the second half of the year 
this trend reflected moderating demand in the north american contract furniture market  combined with the seasonality we typically experience in our order patterns 
the backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  increasing percent from the fiscal level of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of two wholly owned contract furniture dealerships and ceased the consolidation of an independently owned dealership we had previously consolidated as a variable interest entity vie under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
due to this dealership s improved financial condition  the owners were successful in obtaining outside bank financing 
as a result  we were no longer required to include this vie in our consolidated financial statements 
these dealership transitions affected our year over year comparisons 
net sales and trade orders from these dealers included in our fiscal financial results totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the financial results of these dealerships were not included in our consolidated financial statements during fiscal restructuring in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring program designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability 
these actions included the elimination of approximately full time positions within the north american furniture solutions segment 
the positions that were eliminated represented a variety of functional areas  and the individuals affected were offered one time termination benefits  including severance and outplacement services 
pre tax restructuring expenses for fiscal of million  are reflected separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
the related cash payments were million in fiscal the balance of the restructuring accrual at may  is million  and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet within other accrued liabilities 
discussion of business segments fiscal compared to fiscal net sales within our north american furniture solutions segment increased from  million in fiscal to  million in the current year 
this represents a year over year increase of million or percent 
we experienced growth throughout our north american business operations  but particularly strong growth was experienced in the healthcare industry which posted double digit year over year growth 
the healthcare industry remains a key growth area within the segment and lines up with our strategy to pursue diversification 
sales at our mexican subsidiary again reached double digit growth over the prior year 
canadian sales turned around from a flat year in to impressive double digit growth in fiscal operating earnings for the segment in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to segment earnings of million or percent in the prior year 
with top line growth of percent within the segment  we saw both dollar and percent of sales increases to operating earnings in the north american furniture solutions segment 
this segment s strong operating performance is largely due to improved margins on certain recently introduced products  our focus on cost management  and our execution of the restructuring plan discussed above 
net sales from our non north american furniture solutions segment continues to grow at double digit rates 
every region within the segment posted increases in year over year net sales 
total net sales for the segment were million  up million or percent 
sales generated from our non north american furniture solutions segment increased to percent of our consolidated net sales  an increase of basis points from percent in the prior year 
the largest sales contribution within this segment continues to come from our operations in the united kingdom  which posted a percent year over year increase to the top line 
we also saw a strong increase in net sales within continental europe 
our results within the asia pacific region are particularly noteworthy  growing by percent from the prior year 
we continue to pursue our diversification strategy and the effects are clearly visible in these results 
operating earnings within our non north american segment totaled million for the year or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent of net sales in fiscal  an increase of basis points 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
as previously discussed within the context of consolidated net sales  the decrease is primarily the result of oem sales of million recognized in fiscal that did not occur in fiscal net sales within our north american home business were down percent primarily due to the challenges associated with the us macroeconomic environment 
the us dollar continued to weaken against major currencies throughout fiscal the changes in currency exchange rates from the prior year affected the us dollar value of net sales within both primary operating segments 
we estimate these changes effectively increased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million  driven largely by the us dollar canadian dollar average exchange rate during the current year 
currency exchange rate fluctuations within our non north american furniture solutions segment  increased net sales in fiscal by approximately million 
this was primarily driven by favorable movements in the us dollar british pound sterling and us dollar euro exchange rates as compared to last year 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
operating earnings within our non north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal due to the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates relative to the prior year level 
the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment was an increase of approximately million 
discussion of business segments fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  net sales within our north american furniture solutions segment increased to  million from  million in fiscal this represents an increase of million or percent 
on a weekly average basis which adjusts for the extra week of operations in fiscal net sales in this segment were percent higher than fiscal particularly noteworthy is our business within the healthcare industry  which realized significant year over year percentage increases 
sales at our mexican subsidiary reached double digit growth over fiscal canadian sales  which increased over the prior year level during the first half of fiscal  ended the full year approximately flat with operating earnings in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent in fiscal the increase in both dollars and percentage relative to fiscal was largely driven by an percent sales increase and the resulting improved operating leverage 
in addition  fiscal included approximately million in higher compensation related expenses associated with the extra week of operations in that year 
incentive bonus expenses recognized in fiscal were approximately million higher than those recorded in fiscal as determined under our plan 
these factors were partially offset by higher design and research costs in fiscal  which were approximately million higher than those recorded in the north american furniture solutions segment during fiscal our non north american furniture solutions segment had year over year increases in net sales across all geographic regions except south america 
total net sales in fiscal of million were up percent from million in fiscal year on a weekly average basis  net sales in fiscal were percent higher than the prior year 
the non north american furniture solutions segment generated percent of our consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal sales in the united kingdom were percent higher than fiscal our results in the asia pacific region were particularly strong in fiscal  with net sales increasing percent from the prior year 
in fiscal  we expanded our independent dealer network in china and japan 
operating earnings in fiscal within our non north american segment totaled million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent in fiscal net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was driven by the growth of our north american home business 
sales in fiscal included net sales of million from a vie we had previously consolidated under the accounting provisions of fin r 
changes in currency exchange rates from fiscal affected the us dollar value of net sales within both primary operating segments 
we estimate these changes effectively increased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million 
this was largely driven by the general weakening in the average exchange rate between the us dollar and canadian dollar during fiscal in our non north american furniture solutions segment  exchange rate changes increased fiscal net sales by an estimated million 
this increase was driven by favorable movements in the us dollar british pound sterling and us dollar euro exchange rates as compared to fiscal operating earnings within our non north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal due to changes in currency exchange rates relative to fiscal levels 
the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment was not significant in fiscal gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent  an improvement of basis points from the prior year level 
favorable direct material costs contributed to this increased gross margin performance year over year 
lower relative direct labor costs also boosted our margins while overhead expenses were slightly unfavorable 
details relative to each component of gross margin follow 
direct material costs as a percentage of sales in the current year decreased basis points 
although a higher sales volume favorably affected the percentage  the effect of our fixed contracts for the procurement of certain of our raw materials also contributed to the improvement 
the majority of our fixed price contracts expired during the fourth quarter of this year and we began to see the impact of increased costs for our raw material inputs late in the year 
our direct labor costs were lower by basis points as a percentage of sales from prior year levels 
this reduction is primarily due to higher sales volume  and our continued manufacturing process improvements 
overhead costs increased in fiscal from prior year levels 
we recognized certain costs associated with the completion of a large project  and had an overall shift into low margin service related sales  which had the effect of increasing overhead costs by basis points in fiscal freight expenses  as a percentage of sales  were modestly higher compared to levels 
contributing to the additional freight expenses was a significant increase in diesel prices in the united states 
we have continued to benefit from the efforts of our logistics teams to consolidate shipments  increase trailer utilization  and engage lower cost carriers  which together  served to mitigate the impact of increases in fuel costs 
pricing also served to partially offset the increases in fuel costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin improved basis points from the fiscal level 
the leveraging of overhead expenses against higher net sales in fiscal significantly contributed to this improvement 
direct material costs pressured gross margin performance 
these cost increases were offset by the benefit captured through general price increases 
this market pricing  combined with continued manufacturing process improvements  drove a reduction in direct labor expenses on a percent of sales basis 
the improvement in direct labor was achieved despite the implementation of wage increases in the first quarter of fiscal and inefficiencies associated with new product introductions 
as a percent of sales  direct material expenses increased basis points from the fiscal level 
the direct material content associated with the launch of a new systems furniture solution drove a significant amount of this increase 
while these excess costs are typical in the initial years following product launch  the impact was exacerbated by customer demand that far outpaced our business plan for fiscal our efforts to keep pace with this demand drove additional cost into the supply chain 
direct material costs were higher in fiscal due to increased costs for key commodities  particularly steel  plastics  aluminum  and wood particleboard over fiscal levels 
in total  we estimate commodity cost increases added between million and million to our consolidated direct material expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal we were able to offset some of this negative impact through efficiencies gained in connection with our engineering and supply management efforts under hmps 
despite an increase in manufacturing overhead expenses  we improved significantly on a percent of sales basis in fiscal versus fiscal the expense increase was driven in part by the increase in net sales 
we also incurred higher expenses in fiscal for employee benefits such as retirement programs  medical and prescription drug coverage  and annual wage increases for indirect labor employees 
partially offsetting these year over year expense increases were lower incentive bonus expenses in fiscal our incentive bonus program is based on a measure of improvement in economic profit from year to year as opposed to an absolute level of earnings in any one period 
based on our relative performance between periods  incentive bonus expenses recorded within cost of sales in fiscal were million lower than fiscal freight expenses in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  were basis points lower than fiscal this was due to the efforts of our distribution team to consolidate shipments  increase trailer utilization  and engage the services of lower cost carriers 
additionally  our freight percentage was reduced due to the additional net sales captured as a result of general price increases 
operating expenses fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to million  or percent of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
although there was a year over year increase of million  we experienced an basis point reduction to operating expenses as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal a charge of million for restructuring expenses as discussed above is included in fiscal there were no restructuring expenses in fiscal the year over year dollar increase in expenses is primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefit costs  designer royalties  global selling expenses  program marketing costs  and the foreign exchange impact on operating expenses  partially offset by lower levels of charitable contributions  and savings from certain r d and product management programs 
leverage on higher sales levels in the current year drove the percent of sales reduction in operating expenses 
incremental employee compensation and benefit costs in fiscal  which includes merit increases  stock based compensation  and health benefits were an estimated million higher than fiscal global selling costs and designer royalty expenses  both of which vary with net sales levels  were million and million higher  respectively  in fiscal than in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we continued our pursuit of bringing new and innovative products to market  which drove incremental program marketing expenses of million compared to the prior year 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates had an inflationary impact on operating expenses associated with our international operations  as measured in us dollars 
we estimate these changes increased our consolidated operating expenses in fiscal by approximately million relative to the prior year 
partially offsetting these operating expense increases were charitable contributions that were million lower than fiscal and a combined savings from certain r d and product management programs of million 
design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these expenses include royalty payments to the designers of our products 
we consider such royalty payments  which totaled million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  to be variable costs of the products being sold 
accordingly  we do not include them in research and development costs as discussed in note fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales in fiscal this represents a year over year increase of million or percent 
our fiscal operating expenses included approximately million in additional compensation costs associated with the extra week of operations in that year 
we also incurred expenses totaling approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal relating to the three dealerships that were transitioned to independent status in that period 
excluding these amounts  the comparable year over year increase in operating expenses was million or percent 
a significant proportion of this increase from fiscal to fiscal is attributed to expenses such as designer royalties and selling related costs  which vary with net sales 
our portfolio of new product launches at the start of fiscal drove an increase in program marketing expenses relative to fiscal we estimate that approximately million of the year over year increase in operating expenses resulted from higher spending on incremental employee compensation including stock based compensation programs  retirement  and health benefits 
increased expenses related to charitable contributions account for million of the year over year increase 
we also incurred higher operating expenses during fiscal related to our new market expansion efforts 
specifically  the opening of our manufacturing operation in china and the launch of two new business ventures  convia and the be collection tm  contributed to the increase 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates had an inflationary impact on the operating expenses associated with our international operations  as measured in us dollars 
we estimate these changes increased our consolidated operating expenses in fiscal by approximately million relative to fiscal fiscal operating expenses included a pre tax charge totaling million related to a long term lease arrangement in the united kingdom 
additional information on this lease arrangement can be found in note pretax compensation expenses associated with our stock based compensation programs  the majority of which is classified within operating expenses  totaled million in fiscal this compares to million in fiscal the increase over fiscal is the result of our adoption of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal additional information on this accounting standard  including our method of transition and prior accounting practice  can be found in note design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million in fiscal this represents an increase of million from fiscal levels 
royalty payments included in design and research costs totaled million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
operating earnings fiscal operating earnings were million 
this represents an increase of from our fiscal level of million 
as a percentage of net sales  operating earnings in fiscal increased to percent of net sales  a basis point increase over the percent reported in the prior year 
in fiscal year  we reported operating earnings of million or percent of net sales 
other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year and million in fiscal the increase in expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally driven by additional interest expense of million in the current year associated with the additional senior subordinated notes related to our asr program 
net foreign currency transaction gains recorded in fiscal totaled million 
the year over year increase in net other expenses between fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to lower interest income due to a reduction in our average cash and cash equivalents balance between periods 
additionally  net foreign currency transaction gains were negligible in while we recorded a gain of million in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in fiscal versus percent in fiscal the current year effective rate was below the statutory rate of percent primarily due to the domestic us manufacturing tax incentive 
the effective rate in fiscal was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to million in tax credits for foreign taxes  other credits for research and development activities  and tax incentives for export sales and domestic manufacturing 
the fiscal effective tax rate was percent which was lower than the statutory rate due mainly to tax benefits from research and development activities  tax incentives for export sales and domestic manufacturing  and adjustments to recognize certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and percent 
for further information regarding income taxes  refer to note net earnings in fiscal we generated million of net earnings 
this compares to net earnings in fiscal and fiscal of million and million  respectively 
fiscal diluted earnings per share at was an all time record for the company 
earnings per diluted share in fiscal were and in fiscal earnings per share in fiscal benefited from our asr program as well as our stock repurchases earlier in the year 
we reduced the average share count for fiscal by approximately million shares from the prior year level 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights for the fiscal years indicated 
in millions cash and cash equivalents  end of period short term investments  end of period cash generated from operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for financing activities pension and post retirement benefit plan contributions capital expenditures stock repurchased and retired interest bearing debt  end of period available unsecured credit facility  end of period amounts shown include the fair market value of the company s interest rate swap arrangements 
the net fair value of these arrangements was million at may   million at june   and million at june  amounts shown are net of outstanding letters of credit  which are applied against the company s unsecured credit facility  and excludes the million accordion feature disclosed in note during the third quarter of fiscal  the company issued new senior unsecured private placement notes and replaced its unsecured revolving credit facility 
refer to note and note for additional information 
cash flow operating activities cash generated from operating activities in fiscal totaled million compared to million generated in the prior year 
this represents an increase of million compared to fiscal changes in working capital balances resulted in an million source of cash in the current fiscal year compared to a million use of cash in the prior year 
the source of cash related to working capital balances in fiscal is primarily driven from increased current liabilities of million over the prior year  and to a lesser extent  lower inventory of million from prior year levels 
the increase in current liabilities is comprised of million in tax related accruals  million of increased trade accounts payable and million of other accruals 
these sources of cash are offset partially by increases in volume related accounts receivable of million due to increased sales inside and outside north america 
sales outside north america tend to have longer cash collection cycles than those in the us increased sales through our owned dealership network resulted in higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of these sales within the fourth quarter of fiscal a large percentage of the north american accounts receivable increase pertains to our mexican subsidiary which has the longest cash collection cycle in north america the working capital investment in fiscal was related to increases in inventory and accounts receivable  primarily due to the significant level of growth in our non north american furniture solutions segment 
a contributing factor to the working capital investment during fiscal relates to our business with the us federal government 
order activity with the federal government increased significantly during fiscal  particularly during the first and second quarters 
these sales generally require a longer cash collection cycle than do sales to independent contract furniture dealers 
accordingly  we experienced a related increase in accounts receivable 
inventory levels were also affected by this growth in federal government business  since we are generally required to hold product in inventory longer than with non government business 
this extended inventory holding period is necessary to be consistent with our revenue recognition policy for direct customer sales 
the source of working capital cash flow in fiscal resulted principally from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  namely employee compensation and warranty accruals 
this was partially offset by volume related increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels 
collections of accounts receivable remained strong throughout the year  and we believe our recorded accounts receivable valuation allowances at the end of fiscal are adequate to cover the risk of potential bad debts 
allowances for non collectible accounts receivable  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled percent  percent  and percent at the end of fiscal years   and  respectively 
included in operating cash flows are cash contributions made to our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans which totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
for further information regarding the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans  including information relative to the funded status of these plans  refer to note cash flow investing activities capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash outflows related to investing activities in fiscal included capital expenditures of million 
outstanding commitments for future capital purchases at the end of fiscal were approximately million 
we expect capital spending in fiscal to be between million and million 
included in our fiscal investing activities  is a net cash outflow of million related to the acquisition of brandrud 
the purchase of brandrud augments our product offerings to the healthcare industry 
in fiscal  our investing activities reflected a cash outflow of million related to the acquisition of a technology company 
this acquisition added enhanced functionality to the existing product portfolio for our convia subsidiary 
refer to note for further information related to these acquisitions 
our net short term investment transactions for fiscal yielded a million source of cash 
this compares to a million use of cash in fiscal in fiscal  we completed the sale of a facility located in canton  georgia 
the proceeds of million are reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
there were no corresponding sales of facilities in fiscal cash flow financing activities in millions  except share and per shara data shares acquired    cost of shares acquired average cost per share acquired na shares issued    average price per share issued cash dividends paid on january   the company entered into two agreements to purchase shares of its common stock from morgan stanley co 
inc  for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus fees  under an accelerated share repurchase asr program 
the company entered into these agreements as part of a repurchase program approved by its board of directors 
the number of shares to be repurchased under the asr program will be based on the volume weighted average price of the company s common stock during the term of the agreements 
the actual number of shares to be repurchased will be determined at the completion of the asr program 
on january  the company paid million in exchange for an initial delivery of million shares  representing of the shares that could have been purchased  based on the closing price of the its common stock on january  an additional million shares were delivered upon the completion of the initial hedge period which was february  an additional million shares were delivered at the completion of one of the agreements on april  final settlement under the asr will occur in fiscal in fiscal we completed a debt financing transaction involving the issuance of million in senior unsecured private placement notes 
notes totaling million are due in january  and bear interest at a fixed annual coupon rate of percent 
the remaining million of these notes are due in january and bear interest at a fixed annual coupon rate of percent 
we used the million proceeds from the notes for an asr of our common stock 
refer to note for more information related to our long term debt 
in fiscal  we also completed a refinancing of our existing unsecured credit facility  increasing our borrowing capacity from million to million 
the new credit facility includes a million increase option  subject to customary conditions 
the facility may be used to refinance existing debt  provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes 
in fiscal  we also paid off million of debt on behalf of brandrud  our most recent acquisition 
share repurchases inclusive of our asr in fiscal were the most significant factor affecting cash outflows from financing activities during the past three fiscal years 
our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of million in the second quarter of fiscal the amount remaining under our share repurchase authorization at the end of fiscal totaled million 
our board of directors also increased the rate of our quarterly cash dividend in two of the last three fiscal years 
the first of these increases was in the third quarter of fiscal and allowed for an approximate percent increase in the quarterly rate 
the second provided for a percent rate increase and was granted in the fourth quarter of fiscal our total quarterly cash dividend is per share 
interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal of million increased million from million at the end of fiscal the increase related primarily to the issuance of million new private placement notes discussed above and a significant increase in the fair value of our interest rate swap instrument  offset by a scheduled million payment we made during the fourth quarter of fiscal on our private placement notes 
debt repayments made during fiscal totaled million 
at the end of fiscal  we had two interest rate swap agreements in place 
one of these agreements expired during the fourth quarter of fiscal the fair value of our remaining interest rate swap arrangement  as further described in note  was million at the end of fiscal compared to a combined negative million at the end of fiscal the fair values of the swap arrangements change based on fluctuations in market interest rates 
such changes are not included in net earnings of the related period 
instead  they are reflected as adjustments to our consolidated assets and or liabilities 
at the end of fiscal  the portion of our total interest bearing debt that was effectively converted to a variable rate basis through our swap arrangements was million 
these interest rate swaps had the effect of decreasing total interest expense by million in fiscal and increasing interest expense by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal years and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million at each date 
the provisions of our private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require that we adhere to certain covenant restrictions and maintain certain performance ratios 
we were in compliance with all such restrictions and performance ratios during fiscal and expect to remain in compliance in the future 
in fiscal  we received million related to the issuance of shares in connection with stock based benefit plans 
this compares to receiving million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  we repatriated million of undistributed foreign earnings 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs 
contingencies the company previously leased a facility in the uk under an agreement that expired in march under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term 
the company has estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is estimated that these costs will most likely approximate million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liability reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of may  based on circumstances existing in fiscal  the amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  was million 
the company has a lease obligation in the uk until may for a facility that it previously exited 
the company believes it will be able to assign or sublet the lease for the majority of the remaining lease term to another tenant at current market rates 
however  current market rates for comparable office space are lower than the rental payments owed under the lease agreement 
as such  the company would remain liable to pay the difference 
as a result  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in fiscal for the expected loss under the arrangement 
the corresponding impact of this charge on fiscal net earnings was million  net of a million tax benefit  or approximately per diluted share 
as of may  and june   the future cost of this arrangement was estimated to be million and million  respectively 
accordingly this amount is reflected within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of these dates 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is the company s opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to may the fiscal years ended may  and june  each included weeks of operations 
in contrast  fiscal year  which ended on june   included weeks of operations 
this is the basis upon which weekly average data is presented 
the extra week in fiscal was required to realign our fiscal calendar with the actual calendar months 
this realignment is required approximately every six years 
contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods 
the following table summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments 
further information regarding debt obligations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
likewise  further information related to operating leases can be found in note in millions payments due by fiscal year total thereafter long term debt estimated interest on debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations pension plan funding shareholder dividends other total amounts indicated do not include the recorded fair value of interest rate swap instruments 
estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations are based on interest rates as of may  actual cash outflows may differ significantly due to changes in underlying interest rates and timing of principal payments 
purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension funding commitments are defined as the estimated minimum funding requirements to be made in the following month period 
as of may   the total accumulated benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million 
represents the recorded dividend payable as of may  future dividend payments are not considered contractual obligations until declared 
other contractual obligations primarily represent long term commitments related to deferred and supplemental employee compensation benefits  other post employment benefits  and minimum designer royalty payments 
total balance is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at may  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities on occasion  we provide financial support to certain independent dealers in the form of term loans  lines of credit  and loan guarantees 
at may  and june   we were not considered the primary beneficiary of any such dealer relationships as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r and therefore  no entities were included as vies as of these dates 
the risks and rewards associated with our interests in these dealerships are primarily limited to our outstanding loans and guarantee amounts 
as of may  and june   our maximum exposure to potential losses related to outstanding loans to these dealerships totaled million and million  respectively 
information on our exposure related to outstanding loan guarantees provided to such entities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  a qualifying triggering event occurred with a previously consolidated vie which resulted in reconsideration under fin r 
based on this reconsideration  it was determined we were no longer considered the primary beneficiary 
as such  we ceased consolidation of the independent dealership in the first quarter of fiscal net earnings in the first quarter of fiscal were not significantly affected by the consolidation of this vie 
this is because the net earnings of the vie were primarily attributed to  and therefore offset by  minority interest of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our goal is to report financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or to owned dealers  we recognize revenue once the product and services are delivered and installation is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates 
receivable allowances we base our allowances related to receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at may  and june   respectively 
as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  these allowances totaled percent and percent  respectively 
the year over year increase in the allowance percentage is primarily due to the volume increase in our non north american furniture solutions segment and mexico 
goodwill the carrying value of our goodwill assets as of may  and june   totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in goodwill balances relates to our acquisition of brandrud 
we account for our goodwill assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
under this accounting guidance  we are required to perform an annual test on our goodwill assets by reporting unit to determine whether the asset values are impaired 
if impairment is determined  we are required to reduce the net carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
our impairment testing model is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
in completing the test under this approach  we assume that the value of a business today is derived from the cash flows it will generate in the future 
we also assume that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect our best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows could differ significantly 
the results of this test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  indicated that our net goodwill asset values were not impaired 
we employed a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
by this  we mean the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what we believe a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to our reporting units 
we believe the discount rates selected in our testing are conservative in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in the discount rates 
our testing performed in fiscal indicated that a substantial increase in the discount rates utilized would be required before the results would indicate a potential impairment issue 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuation of such reserves is based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and may result in an adjustment to our reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
we also have foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we establish reserves for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on expected future claims for incurred losses 
we also establish reserves for health and dental benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
we also maintain insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions is the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows 
discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
we utilize the services of an independent actuarial firm to analyze and recommend an appropriate rate 
for our domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a cash flow matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to a published discount curve showing the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon fixed income investments 
we set the discount rate for our international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index in that jurisdiction 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate  which takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations  is based on a recommendation from our independent actuarial consultant 
the discount rates selected for our domestic pension and post retirement benefit plans at the end of fiscal were higher than those established at the end of fiscal with all other assumptions and values held constant  this change would result in a decrease in our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses for our fiscal year  which began on june  similarly  the discount rate selected for our international pension plan at the end of the current year was higher than the rate established at the end of fiscal this change would also result in a decrease in our international pension plan expense for fiscal if all other assumptions were held constant 
interest crediting rate we use this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant s account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
we base this methodology on the historical spread between the year us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is appropriate 
expected long term rate of return we base this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
we consider risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents our long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of may   and june   the net actuarial loss associated with our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at both dates  the majority of this unrecognized loss was associated with lower than expected plan asset returns 
for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  we use a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  we recognize the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a portion of our net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
we currently estimate this period to be approximately years 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  the deferred net actuarial loss ie  the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired businesses for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation we view stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain of our employees  non employee directors and officers 
we account for these programs  which include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance share units  employee stock purchases  and stock options  in accordance with sfas r 
under this guidance we recognize compensation expense related to each of these share based arrangements 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model in estimating the fair value of stock options issued in connection with our compensation program 
this pricing model requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of our common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of our common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
in measuring the fair value of stock options issued during fiscal year  we utilized an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
we assumed an average expected term of years in calculating the fair values of the majority of stock options issued during fiscal refer to note for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we encounter matters that raise the potential for contingent liabilities 
in evaluating these matters for accounting treatment and disclosure  we are required to apply judgment in order to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred 
we are also required to measure  if possible  the dollar value of such liabilities in determining whether or not recognition in our financial statements is required 
this process involves the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to contingencies 
new accounting standards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information related to new accounting standards 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management s belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood  and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  the types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in this form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast 
furthermore  herman miller  inc  takes no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastics  textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
overall  commodity prices were mostly flat during fiscal year until the fourth quarter when prices began to increase sharply 
the full year impact of rising commodity prices was in the range of million to million 
commodity prices increased during fiscal  particularly during the first half of the year 
for the full year  the company estimates rising commodity prices added between million and million to its consolidated cost of sales 
during fiscal  commodities were relatively stable with slight improvements to pricing over the prior year 
the market price of plastics and textiles are sensitive to the cost of oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices increased dramatically during fiscal and we began to see the effect of that on our input costs  especially in the fourth quarter of the year 
in fiscal petroleum prices were volatile  however by the end of the year they had declined somewhat 
petroleum prices increased throughout fiscal year in what  prior to the context the current year has provided  seemed like a substantial increase 
as a result  the cost of plastics and textiles increased during fiscal year and moderated during fiscal the company believes future market price increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company manufactures its products in the united states  united kingdom  and china 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company s completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company s reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company s competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  and chinese renminbi 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into five forward currency instruments in order to offset exposure denominated in non functional currency 
three contracts were placed to offset million of euro net asset exposure denominated in non functional currency and two contracts were placed to offset million us dollar net liability exposure in china 
similarly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into three separate forward currency contracts in order to offset million of its euro net asset exposure denominated in a non functional currency 
in both years  the instruments were marked to market at the end of the period  with changes in fair value reflected in net earnings 
at may   the fair value of the forward currency instruments was million  and negligible at june  net gains arising from remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency  which were included in net earnings  were million  negligible and million for the years ended may   june  and june   respectively 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar reduced the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity by million  million  and million for the years ended may   june   and june   respectively 
interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt for which changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an incentive to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it 
as of may   the company has one interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts million of fixed rate debt securities to a variable rate 
as of the end of fiscal year  the company had two interest rate swaps that effectively converted million in total of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instruments are held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
they are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these swap instruments are large financial institutions that the company believes are of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by these counterparties  such losses are not anticipated 
the combined fair market value of effective swap instruments was million and negative million at may  and june   respectively 
the impact of these swap instruments on total interest expense was a reduction to interest expense of million in fiscal and an addition to interest expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as of may   the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt was approximately percent 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding as of that date  a percentage point increase in the weighted average interest rate would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows 
in millions thereafter total long term debt fixed rate wtd 
average interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay variable receive fixed pay interest rate at may  receive interest rate amount does not include the recorded fair value of the swap instruments  which totaled million at the end of fiscal
