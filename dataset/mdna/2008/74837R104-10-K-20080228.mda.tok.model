overview we are a fort worth  texas based independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production of natural gas  ngls  and crude oil 
our focus is primarily on unconventional reservoirs where hydrocarbons are found in challenging geological conditions such as fractured shales  coal beds and tight sands 
we generate revenue  income and cash flows by producing and selling natural gas  ngls and crude oil 
our production generates operating income that allows us to conduct acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production activities to replace the reserves that have been produced 
at december   approximately of our proved reserves were natural gas and natural gas liquids 
consistent with one of our business strategies  we have developed and applied the expertise gained in developing our formerly owned michigan properties to our canadian projects in alberta  canada and our barnett shale interests in the fort worth basin in texas 
our texas and alberta reserves made up about and  respectively  of our proved reserves at december  the delaware basin in west texas and the mannville cbm in alberta represent our most recent exploratory opportunities to apply this expertise 
for  we plan to continue our focus on the development  exploitation and exploration of our properties in texas and alberta 
we have allocated million of our capital budget of million for drilling activities 
approximately million is allocated to projects in texas and approximately million is allocated to our canadian projects 
approximately million of the capital budget has been allocated to construction of natural gas processing and gathering assets  including million associated with kgs 
our company focuses on three key value drivers reserve growth  production growth  and improving the company s operating cash flows 
the company s reserve growth is dependent upon our ability to apply the company s technical and operational expertise in our core operating areas to develop  exploit and explore unconventional natural gas reservoirs 
we strive to increase reserves and production through aggressive management of operations and relatively low risk development and exploitation drilling 
we will also continue to identify high potential exploratory projects with comparatively higher levels of financial risk 
all of our development and exploratory 
table of contents programs are aimed at providing the company with opportunities to develop and exploit unconventional natural gas reservoirs which align our technical and operational expertise 
our principal properties are well suited for production increases through development and exploitation drilling 
we perform workover and infrastructure projects to reduce operating costs and increase current and future production 
we regularly review our operated properties to determine if steps can be taken to profitably increase reserves and production 
in assessing our efforts  we measure the following key indicators reserve growth  production  cash flow from operating activities  and earnings per share 
years ended december  reserve growth production bcfe cash flow from operating activities in millions diluted earnings per share this ratio is calculated by subtracting adjusted beginning of the year proved reserves from end of the year proved reserves and dividing by adjusted beginning of the year proved reserves 
adjusted beginning of the year reserves are calculated by deducting sold reserves and current year production from beginning of the year reserves 
the possibility of decreasing prices received for production is among the several risks that we face 
we seek to manage this risk by entering into financial hedges 
our use of pricing collars and  to a lesser degree  fixed price swaps covering a portion of our production helps to ensure a more predictable level of cash flow while allowing us to participate in a portion of any favorable price increases 
this commodity price strategy enhances our ability to execute our development  exploitation and exploration programs  meet debt service requirements and pursue acquisition opportunities despite price fluctuations 
if our revenues were to decrease significantly as a result of presently unexpected declines in natural gas prices or otherwise  we could be forced to curtail our drilling and lease acquisition activities 
we might also be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
prices for natural gas and crude oil can fluctuate widely as evidenced by market prices varying between approximately and per mcf within recent years 
for february natural gas production  the wholesale price of natural gas was approximately per mcf 
assuming natural gas prices remain at relatively favorable levels  we expect to fund more of our capital expenditures with cash flow from operating activities  however  we do not expect our cash flow from our operations to be sufficient to satisfy our total budgeted capital expenditures 
in addition to cash flow from our operations  we plan to use our credit facility  distributions received from breitburn  possible sales of assets and issuance of debt securities to fund our capital expenditures in financial risk management we have established policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization  including internal controls 
the level of risk we assume is based on our objectives and capacity to manage risk 
our primary risk exposure is related to natural gas  crude oil and related commodity prices 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of swaps and collars  in doing so  we have also limited our ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
commodity price risk we enter into financial derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas production 
at december   we also have an obligation to deliver mmcfd of natural gas under a long term contract the michigan sales contract with a floor price of per mcf through march in december  we determined we would no longer deliver a portion 
table of contents of our natural gas production to supply the contractual volumes under the michigan sales contract 
for the fourth quarter of  we recognized a loss of million for the fair value of the michigan sales contract through the end of its term in march in january  we entered into a fixed price natural gas swap covering all remaining volumes for the remaining contract period  which served to lock in the amount of our obligation under the michigan sales contract 
we also enter into financial derivative contracts that include no cost collars and fixed price swaps to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with our anticipated future production 
as of december   approximately mmcfd and mmcfd of natural gas price collars and swaps  respectively  have been put in place to hedge anticipated production 
additionally  we have used fixed price swaps to hedge  bbld of ngl and  bbld of crude oil of our anticipated production 
anticipated natural gas production of approximately mmcfd has also been hedged using price collars 
at december   and of our and expected production  respectively  is hedged with financial derivatives 
we believe we will have more predictability of our natural gas and crude oil revenues as a result of these long term sales and financial derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes our open derivative positions as of december  related to natural gas  ngl and crude oil production

as a result of 
table of contents settlements of derivative contracts  our revenue from natural gas  ngl and crude oil production was million and million higher and million lower for  and  respectively 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in million of net gains  million of net losses and million of net gains recorded to other revenue for  and  respectively 
interest rate risk there were no interest rate swaps utilized for the year ended december  interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million lower  respectively  as a result of interest rate swaps 
if interest rates on our variable interest rate debt of million  as of december   increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual pretax income will decrease or increase by million 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
we sell a portion of our natural gas production directly under long term contracts with the remainder of production sold at spot or short term contract prices 
all our production is sold to large trading companies and energy marketing companies  refineries and other users of petroleum products 
we also enter into hedge derivatives with financial counterparties 
we monitor exposure to counterparties by reviewing credit ratings  financial statements and credit service reports 
exposure levels are limited and parental guarantees and collateral are used to manage our exposure to counterparties according to our established policy 
each customer and or counterparty is reviewed as to credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit and on a regular basis thereafter 
while we follow our credit policies at the time we enter into sales contracts  the credit worthiness of counterparties could change over time 
the credit ratings of the parent company of the counterparty to the michigan sales contract was downgraded in early and remains below the credit ratings required for the extension of credit to new customers  although we maintain a liability to them pursuant to the contract terms 
performance risk performance risk results when a financial counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations such as commodity pricing or volume commitments 
typically  such risk obligations are defined within the trading agreements 
we manage performance risk through management of credit risk 
each customer and or counterparty is reviewed as to credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit and on a regular basis thereafter 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for the year ended december   non functional currency transactions resulted in a loss of million  reported in the statement of income 
for the years ended december  and  any gains or losses on such transactions were less than million 
while cross currency transactions are minimized  the result of a change in the canadian us exchange rate would increase or decrease stockholders equity by approximately million at december  application of critical accounting policies management discusses with our audit committee the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we believe our accounting policies are appropriately selected and applied 

table of contents use of estimates in preparing the financial statements  our management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including asset retirement obligations  litigation  income taxes and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
oil and gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the development  exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities  but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is generally not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to its alternative  the successful efforts method 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
ceiling test our use of the full cost method requires us to perform a ceiling test quarterly pursuant to sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is an impairment test performed on a country by country basis that determines a limitation  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties  which is generally the after tax value of the future net cash flows from proved natural gas and crude oil reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges  discounted at per annum 
applying the test  we compare the full cost ceiling limitation to the net book value of our oil and gas properties reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the full cost ceiling limitation  a non cash impairment expense is required 
a charge to income for impairment could create a significant loss for a particular period  however  future depletion expense would be reduced 
the ceiling test is affected by a decrease in net cash flow from reserves due to higher operating or capital costs or reduction in market prices for natural gas  ngl and crude oil 
these changes can reduce the amount of economically producible reserves 
oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation s x rule  are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  which do not include financial derivatives that hedge our oil and gas revenue 
our estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed at least annually using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
revisions may result from changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements 

table of contents derivative instruments we enter into financial derivative instruments to mitigate risk associated with the prices received from our production 
we may also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our outstanding debt 
we account for our derivative instruments by recognizing on our balance sheet qualifying derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
the gains or losses deferred in other comprehensive income from the effective portions of derivative instruments that qualify as hedges are recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transactions are realized 
gains or losses on derivative instruments terminated prior to their original expiration date are deferred and recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
the ineffective portion of hedges is recognized currently in earnings 
the fair value of our natural gas and crude oil derivatives and associated firm sales commitments as of december  was estimated based on published market prices of natural gas and crude oil for the periods covered by the contracts and the value confirmed by a counterparty 
estimates were determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and commitment and market prices for future periods  as adjusted for estimated basis  to the volumes stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated future value 
this estimated future value was discounted on each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives 
asset retirement obligations we have obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations or at the cessation of our processing activities 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and associated production facilities 
the estimated fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets is recorded in the periods in which it is legally or contractually incurred 
when the liability is recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to the fair value at the time of the settlement over the useful life of the asset  and the capitalized cost is depleted or depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of the plugging and abandonment or retirement  annual inflation of these costs  the productive life of the asset and our risk adjusted costs to settle such obligations discounted using our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
revisions to the asset obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our oil and gas assets  the costs to ultimately retire these assets may vary significantly from previous estimates 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r on january  we previously accounted for stock awards under the recognition and measurement principles of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
prior to january   stock based employee compensation expense for restricted stock and stock unit grants was reflected in net income  but no compensation expense was recognized for options granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
r requires the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair value on the grant date 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method described in the statement 
under the modified prospective application method  we have applied the standard to awards made after adoption 
additionally  compensation cost for the unvested portion of stock awards outstanding as of january  has been recognized as compensation expense as the requisite service is rendered after 
table of contents january  the compensation cost for unvested stock awards granted before adoption of sfas no 
r has been attributed to periods beginning january  using the attribution method that was used under sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented any tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options within operating cash flows in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flow 
sfas no 
r requires tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified and reported as both an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
income taxes deferred income taxes are established for all temporary differences between the book and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax balances must be adjusted to reflect tax rates that we expect will be in effect in years in which the temporary differences reverse 
qrci computes taxes at rates in effect in canada 
us deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on profits that are expected to be permanently reinvested by qrci and thus are not considered available for distribution to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of sec regulation s k

liquidity and borrowing capacity on february   we extended our senior secured credit facility to february  the facility provides for revolving loans  swingline loans and letters of credit from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed the borrowing base which is calculated based on several factors 
as of december   the borrowing base was equal to million  and is subject to annual redeterminations and certain other redeterminations 
the lenders agreed to provide billion of revolving credit commitments and the company has an option to increase the facility to billion with consent of the lenders 
the lenders commitments under the facility are allocated between us and canadian funds  with us currency available for borrowing by the company and either us or canadian currency available for borrowing by qrci 
the facility offers the option to extend the maturity up to two additional years with requisite lender consent 
us borrowings under the facility are secured by  among other things  quicksilver s and its domestic subsidiaries oil and gas properties including applicable reserves 
canadian borrowings under the facility are secured by  among other things  all of our oil and gas properties including applicable reserves
