item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some information contained in the management s discussion and analysis is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties 
the company operates in a cyclical industry and the results achieved this year are not necessarily an indication of future prospects for the company 
actual results in future years may differ materially from the results presented below 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  fluctuations in the volume and timing of product orders  changes in demand for the company s products  changes in technology  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace  outcomes of environmental contingencies  availability of raw materials  the ability to pass on raw material price increases  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications worldwide 
the overall business comprises three reportable segments surfactants surfactants  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes  dishes  carpets  floors and walls  as well as shampoos  lotions  fabric softeners  toothpastes and cosmetics 
other applications include biodiesel  germicidal quaternary compounds  lubricating ingredients  emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products and plastics and composites 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites five in the us and one in canada  three european sites united kingdom  france and germany and three latin american sites mexico  brazil and colombia 
stepan also owns percent of a surfactant joint venture in the philippines  which is not included in consolidated results or in the surfactant segment results  as it is accounted for under the equity method 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  include three primary product lines phthalic anhydride  polyols and polyurethane systems 
phthalic anhydride is used in polyester alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
polyols are used in the manufacture of laminate insulation board for the construction industry and are also sold to the appliance  flexible foam  coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyurethane systems provide thermal insulation and are sold to the construction  industrial and appliance markets 
in the us  polymer product lines are manufactured at its millsdale  illinois  site 
polyols are also manufactured at the company s wesseling cologne  germany facility  as well as at its percent owned joint venture in nanjing  china which is included in consolidated results 
the company also has a polymer sales office in brazil that does not include manufacturing facilities 

table of contents specialty products specialty products  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are manufactured primarily at the company s maywood  new jersey  site 
because of the diverse markets it serves  the company has numerous competitors 
the company generally competes on price  product performance and the ability to meet specific needs of customers 
in some instances  particularly in the surfactants segment  the company competes with internal manufacturing capabilities of its customers 
this situation can lead to large period to period sales volume swings when such customers decide to manufacture in house product that the company once supplied 
in addition  the company s manufacturing costs are relatively fixed in nature 
as a result  gross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales is susceptible to disproportionate declines when volume decreases 
a number of the company s key raw materials and energy sources are commodities  principally petroleum based and plant based materials and natural gas used to power the company s manufacturing facilities  whose prices fluctuate due to weather  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
since  raw material costs have escalated due to increased global demand  instability in the middle east and tight supplies 
increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements with the company that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent cost increases from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods when there is excess industry capacity 
consequently  it may take time to recover raw material cost increases for some product lines or market segments 
the company raised selling prices numerous times since the company s administrative expenses are subject to period to period fluctuations due principally to the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans and to obligations associated with environmental remediation and related legal issues 
the company operates in a setting of extensive local  state and federal regulations concerning the environment 
the company has been named as a potentially responsible party to perform environmental remediation at the company s expense at a number of geographic sites 
the company believes it has adequate reserves for all known environmental sites  but an adverse determination could result in a significant negative effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
expenses related to legal and environmental matters declined million from to compensation expense related to the company s deferred compensation plans declined million between and not included in administrative expenses is the income earned by the mutual fund investments held by the company to fund its deferred compensation obligations

two events having significant effects on the company s results of operations occurred in the second quarter of the sale of the company s specialty esters product line and the impairment of the goodwill related to the company s united kingdom subsidiary stepan uk 
the following is a discussion of those two events sale of specialty esters product line on april   the company sold its specialty ester surfactant product line for the personal care market to the hallstar company formerly cph holding corporation 
no physical assets were included in the sale 
the product line represented approximately million in company annual net sales 
the products  which are manufactured at the company s maywood  new jersey  facility  will continue to be produced for the hallstar company during a transition period of up to one year 
the sale was for million of cash plus the transfer to the company of a specialty agricultural surfactant product line 
as a result of the sale  the company reported a million pretax gain in the gain was net of related write downs for equipment and inventory as well as severance charges and a provision for expected losses on the fulfillment of a manufacturing agreement associated with the product line sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding the recorded gain 
the company pursued the product line sale after reviewing strategic alternatives for improving the profitability of its maywood  new jersey  plant 
the reconfigured plant will continue to produce esters for the industrial markets as well as the company s specialty flavor and food ingredient products 
the reduced cost structure of the remaining businesses is expected to increase the site s profitability in goodwill impairment as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill 
the company performs its test during the second calendar quarter of each year 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to compare each reporting unit s net book value to its fair value 
if fair value exceeds net book value then no impairment is indicated  and no further steps must be performed 
the test identified that the book value of stepan uk  a reporting unit of the company s surfactants segment  exceeded its fair value 
the fair value of stepan uk was estimated by applying a discounted cash flow method to the projected cash flows of stepan uk 
because the first step of the test indicated a potential impairment of goodwill  a second step 
table of contents was required to determine the amount  if any  of the impairment 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill ie  the reporting unit s fair value less the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets  excluding goodwill to the book value of goodwill 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
upon completion of the second step  the company determined that the impairment loss for stepan uk was million  the entire amount of goodwill on stepan uk s books 
the million non cash goodwill impairment loss was recorded in the three month period ended june  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment reflected an estimated reduction in the fair value of stepan uk s business as a result of the increased risk of attaining the forecasted future cash flows 
the increased risk was attributed to increases in sales volume expected from the shutdown of a competitor not materializing to the degree originally anticipated  coupled with lower than expected margins 
no impairment of goodwill related to other company reporting units was indicated by the annual test 
results of operations compared with summary net income for increased million  or percent  to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for pretax income increased million  or percent 
operating income improved million  or percent  between years 
as noted in the summary and segment discussions below  all three segments contributed to the improvement in consolidated operating income 
gross profit grew million  or percent  between years  while operating expenses declined million  or three percent 
prior year operating expenses included a number of items that did not recur in pretax income was negatively impacted by million of increased foreign exchange losses 
below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
consolidated net sales for were million  or percent  higher than consolidated net sales for all reportable segments reported year over year net sales increases 
a six percent increase in average selling prices  a five percent increase in sales volume and the favorable effects of currency translation accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the net sales increase 
the pass through of higher raw material costs to customers accounted for most of the increase in average net selling prices 
all segments contributed to the sales volume improvement 
the currency translation effect was attributable to a us dollar that weakened against nearly all local currencies for the countries where the company has operations 

table of contents operating income for was million  or percent  higher than operating income for approximately million of the increase resulted from the effects of currency translation 
gross profit improved million  or percent  and operating expenses declined million  or three percent 
all three segments reported higher year over year gross profit 
increased sales volume played a role in the growth of each segment s profitability 
in addition  higher selling prices and an improved customer and product mix contributed to the gross profit improvement for the surfactants segment 
company gross profit was negatively affected by million of curtailment expense resulting from freezing the company s retirement plan for millsdale and anaheim hourly employees 
the million  or three percent  decline in operating expenses reflected lower administrative expenses million or percent partially offset by higher research and development expenses million or six percent and marketing expenses million or five percent 
operating expenses also included the million gain on the sale of the specialty esters product line and the million goodwill impairment charge 
numerous items contributed to the decline in administrative expenses 
the most notable factors were a million drop in legal and environmental expenses  a million reduction in severance costs and a million decline in compensation expenses related to the company s deferred compensation plans 
a million increase in salaried payroll expenses and million from the effects of foreign currency translations partially offset the favorable year to year administrative expense variances 
see the corporate expense section of this discussion for additional details about the year to year changes in legal and environmental and deferred compensation expenses 
the non recurring nature of the million fourth quarter charge for the european surfactants staffing reorganization accounted for the drop in severance costs 
a million increase in salaried payroll expenses accounted for the higher research and development expenses 
the higher marketing expenses were attributable to million of foreign currency translation and a million increase in us salaried payroll expenses 
salaried payroll costs for all categories were up due to fringe benefit expenses  incentive bonus compensation and normal pay increases 
interest expense increased million  or percent  between years due to higher average debt levels and short term interest rates 
increased working capital needs  driven by higher raw material costs  led to the higher average debt levels 
losses related to the company s percent owned philippine joint venture fell million  or percent  from year to year 
losses declined due to a more favorable product mix resulting from an increase in fabric softener sales 
the company expects continuing improvement in the joint venture s profitability in other  net  which includes foreign exchange gains and losses and investment related income and expense  was million of expense for compared to million of income for foreign exchange losses accounted for million of the year to year change 
the re valuations of dollar denominated receivables held by the company s canadian subsidiary and euro denominated payables held by the company s uk subsidiary led to the foreign exchange losses 
throughout  the us dollar weakened in relation to other foreign currencies  and the british pound sterling weakened against the european euro 
the effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for as a result of increased consolidated income for the year  the tax benefit realized from tax credits and deductions as a percentage of income was reduced resulting in a higher effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate also increased due to the recording of stepan uk s goodwill impairment for which no 
table of contents tax benefit was realized and to the favorable effect that one time tax benefits in mexico and the recognition of german tax loss carryforward benefits had on the tax provision 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation between the statutory us federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate

higher average selling prices and foreign currency translation accounted for million and million  respectively  of the net sales growth 
sales volume contributed million to the increase 
all locations reported higher year to year net sales 
price increases necessitated by higher raw material costs and a more favorable mix of sales led to the increase in average selling prices 
sales volume increases for the region s colombia and brazil locations were largely offset by a decline in sales volume for operations in mexico 
surfactants operating income for was million  or percent  higher than operating income for improved results from north american operations  due to an improved customer and product mix and higher sales volume  drove the improvement in surfactants income

table of contents gross profit for north american operations increased percent from year to year as a result of a four percent increase in sales volume 
also contributing were an improvement in customer and product mix and the general strength of the agriculture sector 
partially offsetting the improvement was a million drop in biodiesel profit due to the escalating cost of soybean oil and lower sales volume 
in addition  approximately million of the previously noted pension curtailment expense was charged to north american operations 
about million of the north american gross profit increase was due to the effects of foreign currency translation 
european operation s gross profit increased due to the previously mentioned five percent increase in sales volume and the six percent increase in average selling prices 
the favorable effect of foreign currency translation accounted for about million of the year to year increase in gross profit 
despite higher selling prices and sales volumes  gross profit for latin american operations declined percent between years 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency  gross profit for latin american operations fell million  or percent 
the decline was entirely attributable to the company s mexico subsidiary  which was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs for which selling price increases could not keep pace 
operating expenses for the surfactants segment increased million  or three percent  between years 
excluding the stepan uk goodwill impairment charge and the gain on the sale of the specialty esters product line  operating expenses increased million  or four percent 
a million increase in expenses for north america operations  million of foreign currency translation and million of fees for the registration of the company s biocide products sold in europe accounted for the higher operating expenses 
higher research expenses  due primarily to higher salaries  benefit and bonus expenses  caused the increase in operating expenses for north america operations 
the foregoing was partially offset by a million decline in severance expense 
expenses for included a million fourth quarter severance charge related to the restructuring of the european surfactants organization 
polymers net sales for the polymers segment increased million  or percent  over net sales

polymers operating income for increased million  or seven percent  over operating income for gross profit grew million  or seven percent  and operating expenses increased million  or five percent 
significant improvement for european operations drove the year to year gross profit increase 
the improvement for european operations was largely offset by a drop in gross profit for north american operations  which continued to be challenged by rising raw material costs and which encountered unplanned outages in the phthalic anhydride pa production area 
approximately million of the year to year operating increase was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation

the effects of higher raw material costs and the previously noted pa production problems more than offset the effect of the four percent increase in sales volume 
the persistent escalation of raw material costs particularly affected polyol profit margins 
average polyol raw material costs were up about percent between years 
selling price increases did not keep pace with the rising costs 
the company instituted further price increases to recoup the higher costs 
the company will continue to make capital investments in the pa plant to improve its reliability 
a significant maintenance turnaround is scheduled for later in  which will include equipment upgrades to improve both plant safety and reliability 
the significant growth in european operations gross profit reflected the increases in polyol sales volume and selling prices noted earlier 
raw material costs continue to rise  but thus far selling price increases have kept pace 
the company expects strong demand to continue  but rising raw material costs may negatively affect future margins 
the favorable effects of foreign currency translation accounted for million of the year to year gross profit growth 
the gross profit increase for asia and other was principally attributable to the selling price and sales volume increases noted earlier 
operating expenses for the polymer segment were up million  or five percent  between years 
approximately million of the increase was due to the effects of foreign currency translation 
most of the remaining year to year increase was attributable to higher marketing expenses needed to support the growing european business 
specialty products net sales for were million  or percent  higher than net sales for all product lines reported higher sales due to greater sales volumes 
an increase in selling prices for food ingredient products also contributed to the rise in net sales

a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 

table of contents consolidated net sales for were million  or nine percent  higher than consolidated net sales for all reportable segments reported year to year increases in net sales 
increases in selling prices  due primarily to the pass through of higher raw material costs  along with a favorable mix of surfactants sales and greater polymers volume led to the increase in net sales 
consolidated sales volume increased one percent from year to year 
higher average selling prices and the small sales volume increase accounted for approximately million and million of the net sales growth  respectively 
the favorable effects of foreign currency translations accounted for about million of the year to year change 
operating income for was million  or percent  lower than operating income for gross profit was up million  or two percent  while operating expenses increased million  or percent 
the surfactants segment accounted for most of the gross profit increase as results for north american operations improved due to higher selling prices and a more favorable customer and product mix 
also  increased latin american sales volume contributed to the higher surfactants profits 
gross profit for the polymers segment was up less than one percent from year to year as the effects of higher raw material costs  particularly for foreign operations  and a drop in sales volume for polyurethane systems largely offset the effect of sales volume growth for the polyols product line 
gross profit for the specialty products segment dropped due to higher raw material costs 
in addition to the foregoing  consolidated gross profit benefited from the previously mentioned stepan uk insurance income and the us department of agriculture biodiesel incentive income 
the percent increase in operating expenses was attributable to a million  or percent  increase in administrative expenses and a million  or six percent  increase in marketing expenses 
the above noted europe severance expenses and increases in legal  deferred compensation and consulting expenses accounted for most of the increase in administrative expenses 
see the corporate expense section of this discussion for additional details about the year to year changes in legal  deferred compensation and consulting expenses 
approximately half of the marketing expense increase was attributable to higher us salary expense 
personnel transfers from research areas into the us marketing organization coupled with normal pay increases caused most of the salary expense increase 
on a combined basis  marketing and research expense grew million  or three percent  due to higher salary expense 
interest expense increased million  or percent  between years due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt levels 
the higher average interest rates reflected a greater mix of long term fixed rate debt 
the company made a planned shift to a larger proportion of fixed rate debt in the final quarter of in addition  current year interest rates on short term borrowings were higher than those for the same period of the inflationary impact of crude and natural oils on raw material costs led to higher levels of working capital resulting in the higher average debt levels 
other  net  which includes foreign exchange gains and losses and investment related income and expense  was million of income for compared to million of income for higher investment income generated by the mutual funds held for deferred compensation purposes accounted for the entire million year to year increase 

table of contents the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increased level of biodiesel tax credits that were established as part of the american jobs creation act of and the energy tax incentives act of currently scheduled to expire december  
the decrease was also due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in germany for which valuation allowances had previously been recorded and to the favorable effect of a new tax law in mexico that reduced the tax provision

the average selling price was up seven percent between years 
the effects of selling price increases and the more favorable mix of sales more than offset the effect of a three percent drop in sales volume 
most of the sales volume decline was attributable to a percent fall in commodity laundry products  which resulted from customer product reformulations and market share fluctuations 
higher selling prices reflected the pass through of 
table of contents rising raw material costs to customers 
the improved customer and product mix reflected higher sales volumes for the distributor and specialty foamers market  as focused efforts proved successful in these markets 
these products carry higher selling prices and are more profitable than commodity laundry products 
in addition  sales volume for biodiesel products was up percent over sales volume and resulted in million of additional net sales 
higher selling prices and a percent growth in sales volume accounted for the percent improvement in net sales for latin american operations 
all three latin american subsidiaries reported higher net sales 
growth in fabric softener sales drove latin american net sales and sales volume gains 
the seven percent year to year improvement in net sales for european operations resulted from a three percent increase in sales volume and average selling prices and million related to the favorable effects of foreign currency translations

the selling price increases reflected the company s efforts to recapture margin lost due to higher raw material costs 
higher sales volumes for the distributor and specialty foamers product lines accounted for the improved mix 
as noted earlier  sales for these product lines are more profitable than sales for the commodity laundry product line  which accounted for the reduced north american surfactants 
table of contents sales volume 
gross profit for the biodiesel product line fell million  or four percent  from year to year despite greater sales volume 
gross profit in included million of income for incentives received from the us department of agriculture for increasing biodiesel production 
the incentive program was discontinued during the biodiesel business generated million of us income tax credits that are not reflected in gross profit or operating income  but are included in the full year tax provision 
the nine percent gross profit improvement for latin american operations resulted from the percent sales volume increase noted above 
stepan brazil accounted for most of the latin america gross profit improvement due to increased sales volume 
stepan mexico s gross profit was essentially unchanged between years 
gross profit for european operations fell eight percent from year to year primarily as a result of the non recurring nature of the aforementioned insurance income 
excluding the insurance income  europe s gross profit increased million  or percent  between years due to the three percent increase in sales volume and the higher selling prices 
surfactants segment operating expenses for increased million  or six percent  over operating expenses due principally to the million of europe severance expense

a year to year comparison of net sales by region is displayed below for the year ended increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands december  december  north america europe asia and other total polymers segment higher average selling prices  due primarily to the pass through of raw material cost increases  accounted for the eight percent increase in net sales for north american operations 
sales volume was essentially unchanged from year to year 
sales volumes were up four percent and one percent for the phthalic anhydride and polyol product lines  respectively  but sales volume for polyurethane systems dropped percent 
in  north american polyol sales volume included the unusual sale of two barges of raw materials 
excluding the raw material sales  north american polyol sales volume increased five percent between years as the downturn in roofing insulation board demand that began in the second half of subsided somewhat in a nonrecurring large sales contract that was filled in the second quarter of coupled with the loss of business at three customers drove a decline in sales volume for polyurethane systems 

table of contents the year to year increase in net sales for european operations resulted from a percent increase in polyol sales volume 
the higher sales volume was the effect of concentrated efforts to recover market share that was lost in due to competitive pressures 
the significant increase in net sales for asia and other regions was due to increased sales volume of polyol generated by the company s china joint venture 
sales volume improved four fold as the venture continued to attract new business 
stepan china commenced manufacturing operations in the second quarter of polymers operating income fell million  or two percent  from operating income for gross profit increased million from year to year  while operating expenses increased million 
profit results for benefited from a large polyurethane systems sales contract that was completely filled in the second quarter of profit results for benefited from million of income related to the settlement of a claim for an electrical outage in the company s phthalic anhydride plant precipitated by an undersized transformer installed by the company s electricity provider the entire claim settlement was million  of which million was allocated to the surfactants segment 
year to year comparisons of gross profit by region and total segment operating expenses and operating income follows for the year ended increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands december  december  north america europe asia and other total polymers segment operating expenses operating income the year to year increase in gross profit for north american polymers was attributable to improved pricing for the polyols product line partially offset by the previously noted reduced sales volume for polyurethane systems 
the settlement income related to the electric outage also contributed 
selling price increases for polyols enabled the business to partially recover margin lost from rising material costs 
on average  selling prices for north america polymers were eight percent higher than selling prices for despite higher sales volume  european operations reported an million  or percent  drop in gross profit between years primarily due to higher raw material costs that were difficult to entirely recapture with selling price increases

as of december  and  the company did not have any of the noted off balance sheet arrangements 
environmental and legal matters the company s operations are subject to extensive local  state and federal regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which is typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately million for  million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
over the years  the company has received requests for information related to or has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or 
table of contents property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
see the critical accounting policies section that follows for a discussion of the company s environmental liabilities accounting policy 
because reported liabilities are recorded based on estimates  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december  the company s accrued liability for such losses  which represents the company s best estimate within the estimated range of possible environmental and legal losses  was million compared to million at december  the december   to december   reduction in the accrued liability balance for environmental and legal losses resulted primarily from the payments made for the previously disclosed personal injury settlement related to the company s formerly owned site in wilmington  massachusetts and the settlements reached with respect to the d imperio and ewan superfund sites 
during  non capital cash outlays related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in for certain sites  estimates cannot be made of the total costs of compliance or the company s share of such costs  consequently  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on the company s cash flows or results of operations 
management believes that in the event of one or more adverse determinations in any annual or interim period  the impact on the company s cash flows or results of operations for those periods could be material 
however  based upon the company s present belief as to its relative involvement at these sites  other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in this report and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company 
see also note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 

table of contents deferred compensation the company sponsors deferred compensation plans that allow management to defer receipt of its bonuses and directors to defer receipt of director fees until retirement  departure from the company or as elected 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices made by the plan participants 
the investment options include company common stock and a limited selection of mutual funds 
the company maintains sufficient shares of treasury stock to cover the equivalent number of shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option 
as a result  the company must periodically purchase its common shares on the open market 
the plans allow for the compensation being deferred to grow or decline based on the results of the investment options chosen by the participants 
ultimately  upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive amounts equivalent to the payment date value of the investment choices they have made 
because the deferred compensation obligations may be settled in cash  any appreciation in the value of stepan company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan results in additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the value of company stock or the mutual funds result in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
it is these market price movements that result in the significant period to period fluctuations that impact the company s consolidated statements of income 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represents deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock  the remainder is tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
similarly  a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will fluctuate generally in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
in december  the company  with prior board of director approval  adopted an amended and restated management incentive plan 
the amendment provided participants with an irrevocable election to transfer all or a portion of their deferred compensation accounts attributable to pre bonuses to an alternate company common stock investment option 
the number of share equivalents credited to the participants accounts for this option was based on the december   closing price of the company s common stock 
the share equivalents transferred to the alternate investment option can be distributed upon a participant s retirement or departure from the company only in shares of company common stock ie  there can be no cash settlements of these amounts 
furthermore  such amounts cannot be transferred to the plan s other investment options 
as a result of the irrevocable election  the share equivalent amounts transferred to the participants deferred compensation accounts were treated as equity instruments 
therefore  the deferred compensation obligation that is tied to the alternate company common stock investment option is fixed and will not increase or decrease with the value of the company s common stock 
all post deferrals of bonuses to the company common stock investment option will be directed to the alternate company common stock investment option 
the company implemented this plan change to reduce some of the deferred compensation plan expense volatility as expense treatment is not required for future fluctuations in the value of these shares 

table of contents the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
while these market value adjustments affect the income statement due to their impact on the company s ultimate cash liability  there is not an offsetting income statement impact from fluctuation in the asset value  as generally accepted accounting principles require unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities be recorded as a direct adjustment to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
dividends and capital gains received from the mutual funds  as well as impairment losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss under the other  net caption of the consolidated statements of income 
because the company s common stock is held as treasury stock  no further adjustments are made to equity as a result of market price movements in the stock 
on january   the company will adopt sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the company has elected the fair value option for the mutual fund investment assets related to its deferred compensation plans 
the fair value election for the mutual fund investment assets was made to reduce the income volatility caused by the current accounting treatment for the company s deferred compensation plans 
specifically  beginning in  market value changes for the mutual fund investment assets will be recorded in the income statement in the same periods that the offsetting changes in the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded 
in and prior years  value changes for the mutual fund investments were recorded as direct adjustments to shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the accounting treatment for the portions of the deferred compensation liabilities that are tied to the company s common stock values is not affected by the fair value election 
see the recent accounting pronouncements section of note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a more detailed discussion of the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the accounting treatment of the company s mutual fund investments 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this management s discussion and analysis for discussion of the company s reserves and range of loss estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates in the global marketplace  its cash flows and operating results are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
gains or losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company and its foreign subsidiaries periodically use short term forward exchange contracts to limit the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
as of december   the company s french subsidiary had two forward contracts for the purchase of million in january and february from time to time  the company and its subsidiaries extend us dollar denominated loans or extended trade receivables to each other 
gains or losses on such transactions are recorded in income 
as of december  the company s canadian subsidiary had net trade receivables due from the us parent totaling million 
a hypothetical fluctuation of percent in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar would result in a gain or loss of million 
as of december   the company had net trade receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary and million from its mexican subsidiary 
hypothetical fluctuations of percent in the exchange rate of either the brazilian real or the mexican peso would result in a gain or loss of million or million  respectively 
interest rates the company s debt was composed of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million below the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent cost increases from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price 
table of contents increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward contracts are used to aid in managing the company s natural gas and electric costs 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas in at a cost of million 
a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas covered by forward contracts would result in the company s natural gas cost being million higher or lower than the contractual price in the company s results of operations 
also at december   the company had contracts to purchase a minimum of  megawatts of electricity in at a cost of million 
a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of electricity under contract would result in the company s electric cost being million higher or lower than the contractual price in the company s results of operations
