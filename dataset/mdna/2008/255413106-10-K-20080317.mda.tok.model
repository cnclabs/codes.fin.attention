item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we create products and services designed to improve the experience of media 
our long term goal is to allow creators to have the ability to capture their content in the divx format using any device or software of their choosing and to allow consumers of such content to playback and interact with it on any device or platform 
in  the first step towards our goal was to build and release a high quality video compression decompression software library  or codec  to enable distribution of media across the internet and through recordable media 
as a result  we created the divx codec  which has been actively sought out and downloaded by consumers over million times  including over million times during the last twelve months 
these downloads include those for which we receive revenue as well as free downloads  such as limited time trial versions  and downloads provided as upgrades to existing end users of our products 
after the significant grass roots adoption of our codec  the next step towards our goal was to license similar technology to consumer hardware device manufacturers and certify their products to ensure the interoperable support of divx encoded content 
through december   over million divx certified hardware devices have been shipped worldwide 
our 
table of contents customers include major consumer video hardware original equipment manufacturers 
we are entitled to receive a royalty and or license fee for divx certified devices that our customers ship 
in addition to technology licensing to consumer hardware device manufacturers  we currently generate revenue from software licensing and related support  advertising and content distribution 
complementing our organic growth since  in november  we acquired mainconcept ag mainconcept  a leading provider of h 
and other high quality video codecs and technologies for the broadcast  film  consumer electronics and computer software markets 
through integration  we expect to realize additional opportunities both in our core markets and in related emerging markets that will help advance our long term goal 
our next steps  which we have begun working toward  are to bring together the millions of divx consumers with content creators both large and small to build communities around media  including through the development and licensing of media distribution platforms and services for the internet and consumer electronics devices 
we are optimistic about the future and believe the opportunity for divx is only beginning to be realized 
sources of revenues we have four revenue streams 
three of these revenue streams are derived from our technologies  including technology licensing to producers of consumer hardware devices  licensing to independent software vendors and consumers  and providing services related to digital media distribution over the internet 
additionally  we derive revenues from advertising and distributing third party products on our website 
our technology licensing revenues from consumer hardware device manufacturers comprise the majority of our total revenues and are derived primarily from royalties and or license fees received from original equipment manufacturers  although related revenues are derived from other members of the consumer hardware device supply chain 
we license our technologies to original equipment manufacturers  allowing them to build support of divx technologies into their consumer hardware devices 
in the majority of cases  original equipment manufacturers pay us a per unit fee for each divx certified device they sell 
our license agreements with original equipment manufacturers typically range from one to two years  and may include the payment of initial fees  volume based royalties and minimum guaranteed volume levels 
to ensure high quality support of the divx media format in finished consumer products  we also license our technologies to companies who create the major components in consumer hardware devices 
these companies include integrated circuit manufacturers who supply integrated circuits  and original design manufacturers who create reference designs  for dvd players  digital still cameras and the other consumer hardware devices distributed by our licensee original equipment manufacturers 
because royalties are generated by the shipment volumes of our consumer hardware device customers  and because sales by consumer hardware device manufacturers are highly seasonal  we expect revenues relating to consumer hardware devices to be highly seasonal  with our second quarter revenues in any given calendar year being generally lower than any other quarter in that calendar year 
we license our technologies to independent software vendors that incorporate our technologies into software applications for computers and other consumer hardware devices 
an independent software vendor typically pays us an initial license fee  in addition to per unit royalties based on the number of products sold that include our technology 
we also license our technologies directly to consumers through several software bundles 
we make certain software bundles available free of charge from our website 
these bundles incorporate a version of our codec technology  and allow consumers to play and create content in the divx format 
we also make available from our website an enhanced version of our free software bundles  including additional features that increase the quality and control of divx media playback and creation 
these enhanced versions are available free of charge for a limited trial period  which is generally days 
at the end of the trial period  our users are invited to purchase a license to one or more components of the enhanced bundle by making a one time payment to us 
if they choose not to do so  they still enjoy playback and creation functionality equivalent to our free software bundle 
we believe that downloads of this software benefit our business both directly and indirectly 
our business benefits directly from increased revenues when the user downloads a for pay version 
our business 
table of contents benefits indirectly when free or trial versions are downloaded  as we believe such downloads increase our installed base and therefore the demand for consumer hardware devices that contain our technologies 
we derive revenue from advertisements or third party software applications that we embed in or include with the software packages we offer to consumers 
for example  through most of  we had agreed with google to include and distribute the mozilla firefox browser and certain google software products with our software products 
google paid us fees based on the number of downloads or activations of the included software by consumers 
this agreement expired on november  payments earned under the google agreement accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
beginning in november  we switched from distribution of the google software  to instead include and distribute a co branded yahoo toolbar and internet explorer browser with our software products 
yahoo pays us fees based on the number of certain distributions or installations of the yahoo software by consumers 
yahoo may terminate the agreement  or the revenue we derive for such periods will be reduced  if we fail to achieve certain minimum distribution volumes or certain minimum installations of the yahoo software for specific periods described in the agreement 
this agreement expires on december   and yahoo is under no obligation to renew this agreement 
we derive revenue by acting as an application service provider for third party owners of digital video content 
we provide encoding  content storage and distribution services to these third parties in exchange for a percentage of the revenue they receive from sales of digital content to consumers 
we also derive revenues by encoding third party content into the divx format to allow such content to be delivered more efficiently via the internet 
revenues for digital media distribution and other services have declined slightly for each of the last three years 
in the third quarter of  we reported our first instance of revenue related to content distribution arrangements with consumer hardware oems who pay us a fee for each copy of divx encoded content that is encoded on physical media and bundled with their consumer hardware products 
if our content licensing arrangements with consumer hardware oems or our online video community services are successful  our digital media distribution revenues may increase in future periods 
a small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
in  google and lg electronics accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues 
in  google and lg electronics accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues 
in  google and philips accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues 
we are a global company with a broad  geographically diverse market presence 
we have offices in six countries  and our hardware and software products are distributed in over countries and territories 
we have historically generated a substantial amount of our revenues from international sales  which have grown to represent an increasingly large percentage of our overall revenues 
for the years ended december   and  our revenues outside north america comprised  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
a large portion of our total revenues come from licensing our technologies to consumer hardware device manufacturers  most of whom are located outside of north america 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of license fees payable to providers of intellectual property that is included in our technologies 
generally  royalties are due to our third party intellectual property providers based on when certain of our products are sold  subject to contractually agreed upon limits 
to a much lesser extent  cost of revenues also includes depreciation on certain computing equipment and related software  the compensation of related employees  internet connectivity costs  third party payment processing fees and allocable overhead 
although this may not be the case in the future  and although we have experienced some variability to our cost of revenue structure in the past  in general our costs of revenues have not been highly variable with revenue volumes 
as a result  we generally expect our overall gross margins to fluctuate with revenues 

table of contents selling  general and administrative the majority of selling  general and administrative expenses consists of employee compensation costs 
selling  general and administrative expense also includes marketing expenses  business travel costs  trade show costs  outside consulting fees and allocable overhead 
our headcount for selling  general  and administrative related personnel  including employees and outside contractors increased by from as of december  to as of december   in part as a result of our acquisition of mainconcept 
we intend to hire additional employees and outside contractors for our sales and marketing staff and to increase our selling and marketing budget in the future as we attempt to continue to raise awareness of our products and services 
product development the majority of product development expenses consist of employee compensation for personnel responsible for the development of new technologies and products 
our headcount for product development related personnel  including employees and outside contractors increased by from as of december  to as of december  of those employees were added as a result of our acquisition of mainconcept on november  product development expense also includes bandwidth expenses  depreciation of computer and related equipment  software license fees and allocable overhead 
we expect to increase our product development expenses in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our products and services 
while we expect to continue to hire additional employees to meet our business needs  if permanent employees are not available for hire  we intend to use outside contractors to fulfill our labor needs when and as required to accomplish our operating goals 
opportunities  challenges and risks our technology licensing revenues from consumer hardware device manufacturers have been primarily dependent upon our licensees sales of dvd players that incorporate our technologies 
revenue from technology licensing to consumer hardware device manufacturers increased by from to  and by from to we do not expect our revenue growth rates attributable to dvd player sales to remain as high as they have been in recent years as the markets for dvd players mature 
because our technologies are embedded in dvd players  our licensing revenue is subject to fluctuations based on consumer demand for these products 
we actively promote the incorporation of our video compression technologies for use in other consumer products such as digital still cameras  portable media players and dvd recorders  but there is no assurance we will receive material royalties on sales of these products in the future 
if sales of dvd players that incorporate our technologies do not continue to grow  or if our technologies are displaced from these devices by competing technologies  our revenue would be adversely affected 
historically  the increases in our technology licensing revenues have been driven by increases in the volume of sales of products incorporating our technologies 
however  this increase in revenues has been partially offset by declines in the per unit royalty we derive  which has resulted from a combination of volume based price discounts and overall pricing pressure on established technology royalties in the market 
we believe that if our technology achieves market acceptance as a de facto standard  volumes will continue to increase unless and until our technology fully penetrates the market 
to the extent such market acceptance and volume increases occur  we believe that average selling prices of our existing technologies will decline 
we may not be able to successfully introduce newer technologies with higher average selling prices into the market to offset any such decline 
one or a small number of our licensees generally represents a significant percentage of our technology licensing revenues 
for example  in the fiscal years and  lg electronics accounted for approximately each year of our total net revenues 
a reduction in these sales or a loss of one or more of our key licensees would adversely affect our licensing revenues 
as technologies for dvd players and other consumer hardware devices with video compression capabilities evolve  we must continue to design and deliver innovative technologies that are sought by manufacturers and 
table of contents consumers alike 
part of our strategy is to have our digital media technologies adopted as de facto industry standards for use in consumer hardware devices 
generally  for a technology to become an industry standard  the royalty rates must not be prohibitively costly as compared to other potential alternatives 
as a result  the royalty rates we charge for our technologies will likely be lower than the royalty rates received for technologies not adopted as industry standards  and our long term ability to raise royalty rates for our technologies could be limited by this trend 
during  and  a significant portion of our revenues was generated from our agreement with google 
in november of  our agreement with google expired 
revenues under the google software distribution and promotion agreement represented approximately  and of our total net revenues in the fiscal years  and  respectively 
in september  we entered into a two year global agreement with yahoo to offer consumers who download divx video software tools a co branded version of the yahoo toolbar and internet explorer optimized for yahoo under this agreement  yahoo pays us fees for meeting certain monthly distribution volumes related to our offering of yahoo software to consumers 
we anticipate that the revenues generated under the yahoo agreement will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenues 
however  any decline in the distribution volume of our products or market saturation of yahoo products could result in a decrease in revenue under this agreement 
if we fail to achieve certain minimum distribution commitments for specific periods described in the agreement  yahoo may terminate the agreement 
this agreement expires on december  and yahoo is under no obligation to renew this agreement 
if  upon the expiration of our agreement with yahoo  we fail to enter into a new agreement with yahoo or a similar partner on substantially the same or more favorable terms  our revenues would significantly decrease 
beginning in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires that we record stock based compensation charges in connection with our equity compensation for employees 
as a result of the recognition of additional stock based compensation expense we experienced a reduction in net income of approximately million and million for the fiscal year ended december  and  respectively  and expect to continue to record significant additional stock based compensation expenses in future periods  which will adversely affect our operating results 
acquisitions in march we acquired all of the assets of corporate green  a general partnership that developed an online community platform but had not commenced its principal operations and had not generated any revenue through the date of the acquisition 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was valued at  and consisted of  in cash and  fully vested shares of our common stock  valued at  the entire purchase price was recorded as intangible assets and was being amortized to product development expense over their estimated useful lives of years 
amortization of intangible assets from the corporate green acquisition in and was  and  respectively 
in addition to the purchase price  we issued the former partners of corporate green  restricted shares of our common stock which vested upon the occurrence of certain events 
upon the earlier of december   march  and june  and the occurrence of certain performance milestones  and subject  in the case of the latter two events  to continued employment with us  we paid an aggregate of   and  respectively  in cash to the three former corporate green partners 
at december   all milestones had been completed  the associated restricted shares of common stock had vested  and the milestone payments had been paid 
these deferred cash payments and the restricted stock were recorded as compensation expense in the period in which they were earned 
in may  we made an equity investment in deviantart  inc  or deviantart  a private corporation that aggregates and distributes art via its web community and facilitates an open forum where artists can exhibit their artwork and build community around that art in an effort to drive commerce 
our investment consisted of million cash for which we received certain shares of deviantart s series a preferred stock 
as further consideration for our investment  we entered into an advertising and marketing agreement with deviantart 
we have allocated approximately  of the investment to the advertising and marketing agreement  based on 
table of contents its estimated fair value  and the remaining million is being carried as an investment 
the value allocated to the advertising and marketing agreement is being amortized ratably over the period in which the services are being rendered october through march as our ownership is less than  the investment has been accounted for using the cost basis  and will periodically be reviewed for impairment 
the investment and the long term portion of the advertising and marketing agreement are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the current portion of the advertising and marketing agreement is included in prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
in july  we acquired all of the assets of veatros  llc  or veatros  a limited liability company engaged in real time digital video processing for the purposes of producing enhanced video search and discovery services 
at the time of acquisition  the operations of veatros had been wound down and no development projects were in process 
the acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition of assets in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
the total purchase price for the acquisition is up to million comprised of an initial upfront cash payment of million  which we made in july  and subsequent cash payments up to million upon the achievement of certain technology related milestones 
we did not acquire any tangible assets or assume any liabilities as a result of the acquisition 
we allocated the initial cash payment of million  along with the first two milestones of million  and  of acquisition related costs  for total purchase consideration of approximately million to the one identifiable intangible asset  a patented technology license 
the asset is being amortized over the remaining life of the patented technology license  approximately years 
in july  subsequent to the asset purchase  our board of directors approved a plan to separate our stage operations into a separate private entity  and in stage was shut down 
as a significant portion of the benefit from the acquired patented technology license was originally ascribed to stage future activities  we evaluated the intangible asset for impairment as of december  in accordance with statement of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets based on the projected benefits solely attributable to our core consumer electronics business 
based on our revised forecasts excluding the stage future activities and discounting the cash flows attributable to our core consumer electronics business  we concluded that the carrying amount of the asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded in in the consolidated statements of income  as the acquired patented technology license was considered to have a recoverable value of approximately  in november  we acquired mainconcept  a german based provider of audio and video codec technology 
in exchange for all outstanding shares of mainconcept s capital stock  we paid approximately million 
the total purchase price  including acquisition costs of  was million in cash   shares of our common stock  which were valued at approximately million as of the date of the transaction  and outstanding loans extended to mainconcept by one of its shareholders that we also purchased for an aggregate of approximately million 
the purchase price included approximately million of net tangible liabilities assumed at acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible liabilities acquired amounted to million  of which million was preliminarily allocated to identifiable intangible assets and million was preliminarily allocated to goodwill 
the identifiable intangible assets will be amortized over the remaining useful lives of two to seven years 
the acquisition was not considered material to our financial position at the date of acquisition 
in addition  the purchase agreement provides for additional payments of up to approximately million upon the achievement by mainconcept of certain product development goals and certain financial milestones during if additional payments are made  the consideration will be recorded as additional purchase price and allocated to goodwill 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to use accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
table of contents of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from the judgments and estimates we have employed reporting our financial positions and results  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
revenue recognition we evaluate revenue recognition for transactions to sell products and services and to license technology using the criteria set forth by the securities exchange commission in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
sab no 
states that revenue is recognized when each of the following criteria is met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among separate elements based on their relative fair values  provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
our licensing revenue is primarily derived from royalties and or license fees paid to us by licensees of our intellectual property rights 
revenue in such transactions is recognized during the period in which such customers report to us the number of royalty eligible units that they have shipped 
revenue from guaranteed minimum royalty licenses is recognizable upon delivery of the technology license when no further obligations of the company exist 
certain of our license agreements provide for royalties based on our estimations of the volumes of certain units consumer hardware device manufacturers are estimated to ship during a given term for which we recognize revenue over the term of the contractual agreement 
in certain guaranteed minimum royalty licenses and license agreements based on volume estimates  we enter into extended payment programs with customers 
revenue related to such extended payment programs is recognized at the earlier of when cash is received or when periodic payments become due to us 
if we receive non refundable advance payments from licensees that are allocable to future contract period or could be creditable against other obligations of the licensee to us  the recognition of the related revenue is deferred until such future period or creditable obligation lapses 
royalties and other license fees are recorded net of reserves for estimated losses  and are recognized when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we make judgments as to whether collectibility can be reasonably assured based on the licensee s recent payment history unless significant and persuasive evidence exists that the customer is creditworthy 
in the absence of a favorable collection history or significant and persuasive evidence that the customer is creditworthy  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we have entered into a contractual relationship to license technology to a customer and we also obtained format approval for which we provided consideration to a related customer 
in situations where we do not receive an identifiable benefit that is sufficiently separable from our customers purchase of our products or where we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the products or services we are purchasing  we record the consideration provided to our customers as an offset to revenues in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 

table of contents we have contracts with original equipment manufacturers  original design manufacturers  integrated circuit manufacturers  independent software vendors  advertisers and content providers 
our revenue recognition policies for each of these arrangements are summarized below 
technology licensing to original equipment manufacturers 
we license our technologies to original equipment manufacturers of consumer hardware devices  and in return each original equipment manufacturer typically pays us a royalty for each divx certified unit the customer ships 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period in which we receive competent evidential matter that revenue has been earned in the form of a shipment report from the customer 
if we receive pre certification license fees from a customer  recognition of this revenue is deferred in its entirety until we certify the original equipment manufacturer s product in accordance with our certification guidelines 
if we receive nonrefundable minimum commitments from a customer that are also not allocable to a future contract period  we will recognize the full amount upon billing if collectibility is assured based on recent payment history  but only if we have no further obligation to provide post contract support 
if we have future support obligations pertaining to minimum commitment agreements  we recognize licensing fees ratably over the length of the agreement because vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the unlimited upgrades and support included in the contract 
technology licensing to integrated circuit manufacturers 
we license our technologies to integrated circuit manufacturers and provide support and unlimited upgrades during the contract term so they can incorporate our technologies into the chips they manufacture for consumer hardware devices 
the initial license fee is deferred in total until we certify the integrated circuit manufacturer s product in accordance with our certification guidelines 
because vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the service elements  after certification  we recognize the license fee ratably over the remaining length of the associated contract  which is typically two to three years 
technology licensing to original design manufacturers 
we license our technology to original design manufacturer customers and partners who manufacture devices such as dvd players  portable media players and digital still cameras 
recognition of the related licensing fees is deferred in total until we certify the original design manufacturer s product in accordance with our certification guidelines  after which we have no further performance obligation 
technology licensing for software to independent software vendors 
we license our technologies for resale to independent software vendors and in return the software vendor pays us a royalty for each unit shipped that incorporates our technologies 
revenue is recognized in the period in which we receive competent evidential matter that revenue has been earned in the form of a shipment report from the customer 
in addition  in some cases we receive an initial license fee for our software and agree to provide post contract upgrades and support 
in these cases  we recognize revenues ratably over the length of the contract  as vendor specific objective evidence typically does not exist for the upgrades and support period implied by the contract 
technology licensing for software to consumers 
we license our technologies to consumers via our website for a fixed fee per download 
the license includes upgrades and support until such time as a new pay version becomes available  which is generally referred to as a left of decimal upgrade 
payment is made online with a credit card via a third party payment service provider  who in turn remits aggregate payments to us on a monthly basis 
we recognize these revenues ratably over the period ending at the next expected left of decimal upgrade  which is typically to months from the time of the last upgrade  as vendor specific objective evidence typically does not exist for the upgrades and support under such licensing agreements 
advertising and third party product distribution 
we are paid by third party software companies for distributing their software when such software is downloaded or installed via our website  typically within our own software download products 
the related distribution fees are recognized based on the number of downloads and activations 
we recognize these fees upon receiving competent evidential documentation from our reporting systems 

table of contents digital media distribution services 
we make available our online video delivery system to content customers in return for a revenue share of the download for rental revenue generated by the content provider customer using our delivery system 
the content partner delivers a video on demand movie through its website using our open video system 
the end customer purchasing such content must pay by credit card before being allowed to download the movie 
we earn a certain percentage of each sale based on a pre negotiated revenue share with the content provider customer 
revenue is recognized monthly based on sales reports  net of any returns or charge backs as reconciled by us and the content provider customer 
encoding services 
we encode the content of certain customers into the divx format and charge these customers for this service 
in some cases revenue is recognized in full after the encoding service is performed if the customer agrees to provide a deposit in full 
in other cases revenue is recognized and invoiced based on a calculation of value per unit of divx encoded content that is downloaded from a content provider s site 
we record revenue net of allowances for uncollectible sales 
revenue is recorded net of allowances for uncollectible sales 
we continually monitor customer payment performance and maintain a reserve for estimated amounts that may be uncollectible 
in determining our reserve  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors 
generally  in cases where the customer is new and has an undemonstrated ability to pay  we delay recognition of the revenue until such time as the new customer has paid unless significant and persuasive evidence exists that the customer is creditworthy 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  despite the customer s payment history  we record a specific allowance against amounts due and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably believed to be collectible 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for uncollectible sales based on our actual historical write off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due  customer creditworthiness  geographic risk and the current business environment 
actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and may materially affect our consolidated statements of income and our financial condition 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our financial statements we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this process includes estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  including differences in the timing of recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery to be more likely than not  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it provides that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken 
income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of adoption of fin  we recorded a tax liability of million related to research and development credits and a reduction in retained earnings of the same amount for certain research and development credits that the company could not conclude it was more likely than not that the benefits would be realized 
during the fourth quarter of  we finalized our section limitation analysis and completed our documentation process to support our research and development credits previously reserved under the adoption of fin after we completed the documentation process  we determined that it was 
table of contents more likely than not that approximately million of the tax benefits for the research and development credits should be recognized and accordingly  we recorded a reduction to our reserve of million and a corresponding decrease in current income tax expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and financial accounting standards board interpretation  or fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb  and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and related sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transaction and disclosure 
under apb  compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant  between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price of the option 
we amortized deferred stock based compensation using the straight line method over the vesting period 
for non employees  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting recognition for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods for services 
equity instruments awarded to non employees are periodically remeasured as the underlying awards vest unless the instruments are fully vested  immediately exercisable and nonforfeitable on date of grant 
prior to our initial public offering in september  we granted stock options to purchase common stock to employees with exercise prices equal to the value of the underlying stock  as determined by the board of directors on the date the equity award was granted 
our board of directors had determined the fair value of the our common stock based on several factors  including but not limited to  historical and projected financial results  the risks we faced at the time  the preferences of our preferred stockholders and the lack of liquidity of our common stock 
in  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation expense over the vesting period based on their grant date fair values and does not allow the previously permitted pro forma disclosure only method as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r supersedes apb and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
we adopted sfas r effective january   prospectively for new equity awards issued subsequent to january  as we utilized the minimum value method prior to january   pursuant to sfas r we will continue to recognize compensation expense relating to unvested awards issued prior to january  using apb which is the same accounting principle originally applied to those awards 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r  we reviewed and updated  among other things  our forfeiture rate  expected term and volatility assumptions 
the weighted average expected lives of the options for the years ended december  and reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sab no 
share based payments  or sab  which was issued in march the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
estimated volatility for the years ended december  and also reflects the application of sab interpretive guidance and  accordingly  incorporates historical volatility of similar entities whose share price are publicly available 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes method 
as of december   we had unrecognized compensation of approximately  related to stock option grants made prior to december  in addition  based on stock options granted after january   as of december  we had unrecognized stock based compensation of approximately million  determined in accordance with sfas no 
r 
based on options outstanding as of december   we expect to 
table of contents recognize a total of approximately million of stock based compensation expense during we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future  and to the extent we do  our actual stock based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase

goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer relationships  trademarks and trade names  developed technologies and other intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to eight years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step involves measuring the impairment by comparing the implied fair values of the affected reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets with the respective carrying values 
long lived assets  such as intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assesses the value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate  and recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the assets  plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets if any  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
when an impairment is identified  we reduce the carrying amount of the assets to estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or  when available and appropriate  comparable market values

table of contents interest income  net we recorded net interest income of million for compared to million for this increase is reflective of higher average cash balances  which principally resulted from proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in our initial public offering in september  as well as an increase in the average yields realized on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we recorded net interest income of million for compared to  for this increase is reflective of higher average cash balances  which during the first three quarters of have principally resulted from positive cash flow from operations 
the higher cash balance in the last quarter of was principally the result of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in our initial public offering 
income tax expense we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit recorded during was primarily due to the removal of a reserve on our us deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss nol carryforwards and certain research and development credits of approximately million  a reduction in our fin liability of approximately million related to the removal of our reserve for research and development credits established as a result of the implementation of fin  and a reduction in the valuation allowance related to our foreign tax credits of approximately million 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million as a result of the completion of our section limitation analysis and the completion of a research and development credit study related to our nol carryforwards and certain research and development credits 
in addition  based on the weight of available evidence  including cumulative profitability in recent years  we determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of our us deferred tax assets would be realized and  as of december   eliminated million of our valuation allowance associated with our us deferred tax assets 
the elimination of our valuation allowance resulted in a million benefit recognized as a non cash increase in earnings for the year ended december  after we completed our research and development credit documentation process  we determined that it was more likely than not that approximately million of the fin liability should be reversed and we recorded a reduction to our fin accrual of million and a corresponding decrease in current income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately  excluding the tax benefits described above 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is due to the impact of accounting for share based compensation related to certain share based awards  and mainconcept acquisition costs  which are treated as permanent differences  in addition  the company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated by mainconcept due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize this asset 
in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  statement no 
 net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of approximately  and million was provided on deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable was determined based on i taxable income in prior carry back years  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  iii tax planning strategies  and iv future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
as of december   we reversed a valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets totaling approximately million 
based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a net income tax benefit of million 
this reversal is the result of our recent sustained history of operating profitability and the determination by management that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was judged to be more likely than not 
we exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets are not accurate  we could be required to record additional reserves against deferred tax assets in future periods 
as a result of our elimination of valuation allowance associated with us deferred tax assets  our effective tax rate in subsequent periods is likely to more closely resemble the applicable federal and state statutory rates 

table of contents the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million at december  is primarily provided for foreign nol carryforwards that we believe are more likely than not to expire before we can use them

we have the ability to hold these auction rate debt securities until maturity 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments to affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
during we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank consisting of a million revolving line of credit for working capital purposes and up to million to finance eligible equipment whereby we could receive term loans  due in to monthly installments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in united states interest rates 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk 
all of our fixed income investments are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments are subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of million of our cash and cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the remaining million of our investments by approximately million 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our consolidated statements of income until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
our long term capital lease obligations bear interest at fixed rates and therefore we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to these obligations
