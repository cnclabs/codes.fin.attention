item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with evercore partners inc s combined consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview evercore is an investment banking boutique 
our operations consist of two business segments advisory and investment management 
advisory generates revenue from fees for providing advice on matters of strategic importance to our clients  including mergers  acquisitions  restructurings  divestitures  leveraged buy outs  recapitalizations and other corporate transactions 
our advisory segment generated million   of our net revenue in  million  or  of our net revenue in  and million  or  of our net revenue in investment management generates revenue from fees earned for managing the private equity funds and the portfolio companies of the private equity funds 
we earn revenue from profit overrides  referred to as carried interest  earned when certain financial returns are achieved over the life of a fund  through net gains and losses on investments of our own capital in the funds and from other sources 
investment management also generates revenue from managing funds invested in the publicly traded securities 
our investment management segment generated million  or  of our net revenue in  million  or  of our net revenue in  and million  or  of our net revenue in reorganization formation transaction prior to the ipo  our business  or predecessor company  had historically been owned by our senior managing directors 
on august   and pursuant to a contribution and sale agreement dated as of may   our senior managing directors contributed to evercore lp each of the various entities included in our historical combined financial statements that were under common control of the members  with the exception of 
table of contents the general partners of ecp i  ecp ii and evp and certain other entities through which messrs 
altman and beutner fund their capital commitments to ecp i  forming the successor company 
the successor company has continued to conduct the same business as the predecessor company 
more specifically  our senior managing directors contributed to evercore lp all of the equity interests in evercore group holdings lp  a delaware limited partnership egh and its general partner  evercore group holdings llc egh wholly owns evercore partners services east llc east  the operating company that in turn wholly owns the advisors to the ecp ii and evp funds and certain other entities 
as part of the formation transaction  evercore advisors llc  the advisor to ecp i  egl  evercore s registered broker dealer and evercore properties llc  evercore s leaseholding entity were sold to east 
evercore gp holdings llc  a delaware limited liability company gp holdings which became a non managing member of the general partner of ecp ii and is entitled to to depending on the particular fund investment of any carried interest realized from that fund following the reorganization  which represented of the carried interest then allocable to our senior managing directors 
in exchange for these contributions to evercore lp  our senior managing directors and certain trusts benefiting certain of their families received  vested and  unvested evercore lp partnership units 
the vesting arrangements applicable to these evercore lp partnership units are described under operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense 
in addition  we distributed cash to the members so as to distribute to them all earnings for the period from january  to the date of the closing of the contribution and sale agreement 
we accounted for this transaction  which we refer to as the formation transaction  substantially by using the members historical cost of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recorded minority interest to reflect the members ongoing ownership in evercore lp 
we account for the unvested evercore lp partnership units issued in the formation transaction as future compensation expense 
see follow on offering of evercore partners inc class a common stock 
combination with protego protego s business historically was owned by its directors and other stockholders and conducted by protego and its subsidiaries and protego si 
concurrently with the formation transaction  we and protego undertook the following steps pursuant to the contribution and sale agreement  which we refer to collectively as the protego combination evercore lp acquired protego and its subsidiaries including a interest in pcb  protego s asset management subsidiary and a interest in the discovery fund  and protego si in exchange for million aggregate principal amount of non interest bearing notes  and mr 
aspe and the other protego directors became senior managing directors of evercore partners inc and subscribed  collectively with certain companies they control  certain trusts benefiting their families and a trust benefiting certain directors and employees of protego  for  vested and  unvested evercore lp partnership units 
of the million in notes issued in consideration for the protego combination  million was payable in cash and million was payable in shares of our class a common stock valued at the ipo price of per share 
we issued  shares of class a common stock upon repayment of such notes 
in addition  protego distributed to its directors cash and to the extent cash was not available  interest in certain accounts receivable  so as to distribute to its directors all earnings for the period from january   to the date of the closing of the contribution and sale agreement 

table of contents ipo on august   evercore partners inc completed the ipo of its class a common stock by issuing  shares of its class a common stock  including shares issued to the underwriters pursuant to their election to exercise in full their overallotment option  for cash consideration of per share net of underwriting discounts to a syndicate of underwriters 
evercore partners inc contributed all of the net proceeds from the ipo to evercore lp  and evercore lp issued to evercore partners inc a number of evercore lp partnership units equal to the number of shares of class a common stock that evercore partners inc issued in connection with the protego combination and in the ipo 
evercore partners inc also became the sole general partner of evercore lp 
as a result of the formation transaction  the protego combination and the other transactions described above  which we collectively refer to as the reorganization  immediately following the ipo evercore partners inc became the sole general partner of evercore lp and  through evercore lp and its subsidiaries  operates our business  including the business of protego  our senior managing directors  including the former directors of protego  and certain companies they control  certain trusts benefiting certain of their families and a trust benefiting certain directors and employees of protego held shares of our class b common stock and  evercore lp partnership units  and our public stockholders including certain former stockholders of protego who received million payable in shares of our class a common stock as described above collectively owned  shares of class a common stock 
the class b common stock provides its holder with no economic rights but entitles the holder to a number of votes that is equal to the number of evercore lp partnership units held by such holder 
subject to the vesting and transfer restriction provisions of the evercore lp partnership agreement  the limited partners of evercore lp are entitled to exchange their evercore lp partnership units for shares of class a common stock on a one for one basis  subject to customary rate adjustment for stock splits  stock amendments and reclassifications 
acquisition of braveheart on december   we completed the acquisition of braveheart 
braveheart was organized to provide corporate finance and private equity advisory services  subject to its receipt of applicable regulatory approvals 
in exchange for of the outstanding share capital of braveheart  we paid initial consideration  deferred consideration and earn out consideration 
the initial consideration was comprised of  shares of evercore partners inc class a common stock 
the deferred consideration is comprised of  additional shares of class a common stock 
of this deferred consideration   shares were issued to braveheart shareholders on april  the braveheart shareholders also received earn out consideration based on gross revenues generated by braveheart s financial advisory business carried on in europe 
the amount of earn out consideration was earned at the point of acquisition and accordingly  we issued to the braveheart shareholders  collectively  million of loan notes due which bear interest at libor plus basis points and which are redeemable by the holder at any time after october  additionally  we paid million in cash as part of the acquisition 
an additional  shares were authorized to be issued to braveheart shareholders on march  follow on offering of evercore partners inc class a common stock on may   we completed a follow on offering of  shares of class a common stock for cash consideration of per share net of underwriting discounts 
net proceeds in conjunction with this issuance after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were million 
we contributed all of the net proceeds from this follow on offering to evercore lp  and evercore lp issued to us  evercore lp partnership units 
we intend to use these proceeds to expand and diversify our advisory 
table of contents and investment management businesses and for general corporate purposes in our operating subsidiary  evercore lp 
in conjunction with the follow on offering  members exchanged  evercore lp partnership units for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the follow on offering related transactions resulted in messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe  and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  collectively  ceasing to beneficially own at least of the aggregate evercore lp partnership units owned by them on the date of the reorganization  which in turn resulted in the vesting of  or approximately  of the unvested evercore lp partnership units   unvested rsus and  unvested shares of restricted stock 
the vesting of evercore lp partnership units resulted in a non cash charge to compensation expense and an offsetting increase in minority interest of million on our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december   and the vesting of rsus and restricted stock resulted in a non cash charge to compensation expense of million and an offsetting increase in stockholders equity of million on our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  we refer to the above transactions collectively as the follow on offering 
prior to the follow on offering  each holder of class b common stock had effectively ceded their voting rights with respect to their ownership of class b common stock and evercore lp partnership units to messrs altman  beutner and aspe 
subsequent to the follow on offering  each holder of class b common stock is entitled to one vote for each evercore lp partnership unit held by such holder 
at the completion of the follow on offering   or  of the non forfeited  unvested rsus issued in conjunction with the ipo vested 
as with the unvested evercore lp partnership units  the rsus that vested were charged to expense at the completion of the follow on offering based on the grant date fair value of the class a common stock deliverable pursuant to such rsus  which is the ipo price of the class a common stock of per share 
accordingly  at the completion of the follow on offering we recorded a non cash equity based compensation charge associated with the vesting of these previously unvested rsus of million 
following the completion of the follow on offering  if all of the remaining unvested and unforfeited rsus as of december  were to vest at some point in the future  based on the grant date fair value of the class a common stock deliverable pursuant to such rsus of per share  the total amount of compensation expense that we will record in connection with the vesting of these unvested rsus would be approximately million 
to the extent unvested rsus vest  they are included in weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share  which has a dilutive effect on these measures 
in the first six months of and prior to the follow on offering  and in connection with new hiring activity  we granted  rsus with a grant date fair value of per unit   of which were fully vested and  of which were unvested and vest upon the same conditions as the unvested evercore lp partnership units issued in connection with the reorganization and  shares of restricted stock with a grant date fair value of per share  all of which were unvested and vest upon the earlier of one year following the date of grant or when messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe  and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  collectively  cease to beneficially own at least of the aggregate evercore lp partnership units owned by them on the date the reorganization was effected 
at the completion of the follow on offering   of these rsus and all of these  shares of restricted stock vested and we accordingly recorded a non cash equity based compensation charge of million in connection therewith 
prior to the follow on offering  members exchanged  evercore lp partnership units that they held on a one for one basis for shares of our class a common stock 
in addition  evercore lp partnership units held by members may be exchanged in the future for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis  subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits  stock dividends and reclassifications 
this exchange and any such future exchanges are expected to result in an increase in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp 
these increases in tax basis increase for tax purposes amortization and  therefore  reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay 

table of contents we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with members that provides for the payment by us to an exchanging member of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis 
we expect to benefit from the remaining of cash savings  if any  in income tax that we realize 
while the actual amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of exchanges  the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income  we expect that  as a result of the size of the increases of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp attributable to our interest in evercore lp  during the expected term of the tax receivable agreement  the payments that we may make to our members could be substantial 
assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law  and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization  we expect that future payments to our members in respect of the exchange of evercore lp partnership units that occurred prior to the follow on offering to aggregate approximately million  resulting in payments of approximately  on average  million per year  based on a value of the class a common stock of per share 
future payments to our members in respect of subsequent exchanges pursuant to the tax receivable agreement would be in addition to these amounts and are expected to be substantial 
the effects of the tax receivable agreement on our condensed consolidated statement of financial condition as a result of the exchange of  evercore lp partnership units by members prior to the follow on offering were as follows we recorded an increase of million in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increase in the tax basis of the assets owned by evercore lp  based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the transaction 
to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset  based on an analysis of expected future earnings  we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance  and we recorded of the estimated realizable tax benefit which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance as an increase of million to payable to related parties and the remaining of the estimated realizable tax benefit  or million  as an increase to paid in capital 
therefore  as of the date of the exchange of the evercore lp partnership units  on a cumulative basis the net effect of accounting for income taxes and the tax receivable agreement on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements was a net increase in stockholders equity of of the estimated realizable tax benefit 
the amounts that were recorded for both the deferred tax asset and the liability for our obligations under the tax receivable agreement have been estimated 
any additional payments under the tax receivable agreement that will further increase the tax benefits and the estimated payments under the tax receivable agreement have not been included in this estimate 
all of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the exchange will be included in net income 
similarly  the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income 
future exchanges of evercore lp partnership units for our shares of class a common stock will be accounted for in a similar manner 
comparability of results for various periods the successor company results represent the consolidated results of evercore partners inc and its subsidiaries subsequent to our ipo on august  the predecessor company results represent the results of the combined entities known as evercore holdings prior to the reorganization 
both the predecessor and successor company results have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as discussed above  during we entered into several material transactions that make it more difficult to compare the results of with in particular the formation transaction  which includes the elimination of the financial results of the general partners of the ecp i  ecp ii and evp funds and certain other entities through which co chief 
table of contents executive officers have invested capital in the ecp i fund  which was not contributed to evercore lp  and the protego and braveheart acquisitions which resulted in the inclusion of each of the acquired entity s financial results  as well as certain purchase accounting adjustments  such as the recording of intangible assets and their periodic amortization 
in addition to the inclusion and exclusion of the results of certain entities  the transactions mentioned above had additional effects on our results that also limit the ability to compare with principally prior to the ipo  evercore was not subject to federal income taxes  but was subject to new york city ubt and new york city general corporation taxes 
as a result of the ipo  the operating business entities of evercore were restructured and a portion of evercore s income is subject to us federal income taxes  as well as foreign  state and local taxes  and payments for services rendered by evercore s senior managing directors were historically accounted for as distributions of members capital rather than as compensation expense 
following the ipo  management has included all payments for services rendered by the senior managing directors in employee compensation and benefits expense 
key financial measures revenue total revenues reflect revenues from advisory and investment management that includes transaction related client reimbursements plus interest income and other revenue 
net revenues reflect total revenues less interest expense related to repurchase agreements and other borrowings 
advisory 
our advisory business earns fees from our clients for providing advice on mergers  acquisitions  restructurings  leveraged buy outs  recapitalizations and other corporate transactions 
the amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement 
in general  fees are paid at the time we sign an engagement letter  during the course of the engagement or when an engagement is completed 
the majority of our advisory revenue comes from fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  to secure necessary financing or to achieve necessary regulatory approvals 
revenue trends in our advisory business generally are correlated to the volume of m a activity and restructurings 
however  deviations from this trend can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for example  changes in our market share or the ability of our clients to close certain large transactions can cause our revenue results to diverge from the level of overall m a or restructuring activity 
we operate in a highly competitive environment where there are no long term contracted sources of revenue and each revenue generating engagement is separately awarded and negotiated 
our list of clients  including our list of clients with whom there is a currently active revenue generating engagement  changes continually 
we gain new clients through our business development initiatives  through recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from executives  directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
we may also lose clients as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
investment management 
our investment management business includes operations related to the management of the private equity funds and funds invested in publicly traded securities public securities 
private equity revenue sources include the following management and performance fees portfolio company fees and gains or losses on investments in the private equity funds we manage 

table of contents management and performance fees 
management fees are generally a percentage of committed capital the total dollar amount of capital pledged to a fund from certain outside investors in each of the private equity funds we manage 
during the commitment period  or until full investment  these fees are typically per annum of committed capital 
thereafter  for the remainder of the fund s life  these fees are per annum of invested capital  and in december of  the commitment period for ecp ii  our most recent us fund  expired 
the entities which are entitled to the management fees from the private equity funds we manage were contributed to evercore lp 
accordingly  we reflect the management fees from all of these funds in our consolidated financial statements following the ipo 
carried interest is a profit override earned by the general partners of the private equity funds we manage when certain financial return targets and hurdles are met 
generally  the carried interest is calculated as of the profits  provided that certain outside investors in the funds have earned an return on investments from the private equity funds and a return on investments from evp 
accordingly  the amount of carried interest earned depends on the profits  if any  ultimately generated within the funds 
our historical combined statements of operations for the period prior to august   include the results of the general partners of the private equity funds  including the carried interest earned by these general partners 
participation in such carried interest historically has been allocated principally to our senior managing directors and other employees and any carried interest ultimately realized was paid directly to such individuals 
following the ipo  we no longer consolidate the results of the general partners of the private equity funds 
accordingly  we no longer recognize as revenue any carried interest earned by the general partners of ecp i or evp 
however  through our equity interest in the general partner of ecp ii and the discovery fund  we recognize as revenue to depending on the particular fund investment of any carried interest from these funds 
portfolio company fees 
portfolio company fees include monitoring  director and transaction fees associated with services provided to the portfolio companies of the private equity funds we manage 
we earn monitoring fees for services we provide with respect to the development and implementation of strategies for improving operating  marketing and financial performance 
monitoring fee revenue is recognized ratably over the period for which services are provided 
we earn director fees for the services provided by our senior managing directors who serve on the boards of directors of portfolio companies 
we earn transaction fees for providing advice on the acquisition of portfolio companies held by the private equity funds 
these fees are earned and recognized under the same revenue recognition policies as advisory fees 
gains or losses on investments 
gains and losses include both realized gains and losses upon the sale of all or a portion of a portfolio company and unrealized gains and losses on investments arising from changes in the fair value of the portfolio companies 
because our historical combined statements of operations include the results of the general partners of the private equity funds we currently manage and certain other entities through which two of our founding senior managing directors have invested capital in ecp i  our historical results include such realized or unrealized gains or losses 
following the ipo  because we no longer consolidate the results of these entities  we no longer recognize as revenue any of the gains or losses arising from these entities investments in ecp i or evp 
however  through our equity interest in the general partner of ecp ii and the discovery fund  we continue to recognize revenue based on our share of those funds realized or unrealized gains or losses 
as of december   we had an aggregate carrying value of million of investments in and an aggregate of million of unfunded commitments to ecp ii  the discovery fund and evercore mexico capital partners ii  lp emcp ii 
evercore currently intends to be entitled to of any management fees and portfolio company fees earned in relation to any private equity fund formed after the ipo that it manages 
the company also currently intends to consolidate the general partners of any private equity fund formed after the ipo that it manages 
accordingly  it expects to record as revenue of any carried interest and realized or unrealized gains or losses on investments earned by these entities 
however  the company expects to allocate to its senior managing directors and other employees  through the direct interests these individuals will hold  a significant 
table of contents percentage of any such carried interest 
in addition  these individuals will be entitled to any such gains or losses on investment based on the amount of the general partners capital they contribute in respect of any such fund 
unlike ecp i  where the company made no direct investment or ecp ii where the company s direct investment is less than of total capital committed  the company currently intends to make significant capital commitments to any future private equity fund it manages 
our public securities business is comprised of pcb and eam 
pcb s revenue sources include management and performance fees  dealer spreads on client transactions  and net interest revenue earned by pcb in collateralized financing transactions 
we own a equity interest in eam  with the balance of eam s equity held by its senior management team 
we account for our investment in eam under the equity method of accounting whereby we recognize our share of earnings and losses in investment management revenues 
additionally  we earn revenue associated with gains and losses on our direct investments in eam managed products 
net interest revenue 
net interest revenue is derived from investing customer funds in financing transactions by pcb 
these transactions are primarily repurchases and resales of mexican government securities 
revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction 
transaction related client reimbursements 
in both our advisory and investment management segments we make various transaction related expenditures  such as travel and professional fees  on behalf of our clients 
pursuant to the engagement letters with our clients or the contracts with the limited partners in the private equity funds we manage  these expenditures may be reimbursable 
we define these expenses as transaction related expenses and record such expenditures as incurred and record revenue when it is determined that clients have an obligation to reimburse us for such transaction related expenses 
specifically  client expense reimbursements are recorded as revenue on the combined consolidated statements of operations on the later of the date an engagement letter is executed or the date we pay or accrue the expense 
operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense 
prior to the ipo  our employee compensation and benefits expense reflected compensation solely to non senior managing directors 
historically  payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors  including all salaries and bonuses  had been accounted for as distributions from members capital rather than as employee compensation and benefits expense 
as a result  our employee compensation and benefits expense and net income had not reflected payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors 
following the ipo  we include all payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors in employee compensation and benefits expense 
the company has targeted total employee compensation and benefits awarded to employees at a level approximating of net revenue 
during  the company exceeded that level as a direct result of the new senior managing director hires  who have positioned evercore for continued growth 
we announced the hiring or promotion of eight new senior managing directors in including one evercore europe senior managing director who joined the firm on january  
the company retains the ability to exceed its compensation and benefits award target  change the target or change how the target is calculated at any time and will manage compensation expenses to an appropriate percentage of revenue given relevant market conditions 
increasing the number of high caliber senior managing directors is critical to our growth efforts 
typically we hire new senior managing directors in the middle of a calendar year  but the new hires do not begin to generate significant revenue in the year they are hired 

table of contents we changed our annual compensation program during to include stock based compensation awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain us senior managing directors 
these equity awards will be subject to annual vesting requirements over a four year period beginning at the date of grant which occurred in early  accordingly  the expense will be amortized over the vesting period 
approximately two thirds of the evercore lp partnership units received by our senior managing directors  other than mr 
altman and mr 
beutner  in the formation transaction and two thirds of the evercore lp partnership units received by the directors of protego who became our senior managing directors  other than mr 
aspe  and certain companies they control and a trust benefiting directors and employees of protego in the protego combination are  with specified exceptions  subject to forfeiture and re allocation to other senior managing directors or  in the event that there are no eligible senior managing directors  forfeiture and cancellation if the senior managing director ceases to be employed by us prior to the occurrence of specified vesting events 
 or approximately  of these unvested evercore lp partnership units vested in conjunction with the follow on offering 
in addition  the company entered into a severance agreement with an employee which modified the award terms that resulted in the company expensing the value of the employee s unvested evercore lp partnership units 
the remaining unvested evercore lp partnership units issued will vest upon the earliest to occur of the following events when messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe  and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  collectively  cease to beneficially own at least of the aggregate evercore lp partnership units owned by them at the time of the reorganization  a change of control of evercore  or two of messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe are not employed by  or do not serve as a director of  evercore partners inc or one of its affiliates within a year period following the ipo 
in addition  of the remaining unvested evercore lp partnership units held by a senior managing director will vest if such senior managing director dies or becomes disabled while in our employ 
our equity committee  which is comprised of messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe  may also accelerate vesting of unvested evercore lp partnership units at any time 
post reorganization  on august   we account for the unvested evercore lp partnership units as compensation paid to employees in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payments  sfas r  which we adopted effective january  the unvested evercore lp partnership units vest based on the achievement of one of the performance and service vesting conditions as described above 
in accordance with sfas r  accruals of compensation costs for awards with a performance or service condition are based on the probable outcome of that service or performance condition 
compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and is not accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
we had heretofore concluded that it was not probable that the conditions relating to a decline in the collective beneficial ownership of messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  a change of control of evercore or a lack of continued association of messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe with evercore would be achieved  or that the death or disability condition during the employment period would be satisfied 
accordingly  prior to the follow on offering  we had not been accruing compensation expense relating to any unvested evercore lp partnership units 
we recorded compensation expense in conjunction with the vesting that occurred due to the follow on offering as described below  and we continue to believe that it is not probable that the remaining conditions relating to vesting of evercore lp partnership units will be achieved  or that the death or disability condition during the employment period will be satisfied 
accordingly  we do not intend to accrue compensation expense in the future relating to the remaining unvested evercore lp partnership units unless such conditions become probable 

table of contents non compensation expense 
the balance of our operating expenses includes costs for occupancy and equipment rental  professional fees  travel and related expenses  communications and information services  depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses 
we refer to all of these expenses as non compensation expense 
as a result of the ipo we are no longer a private company and our costs for such items as insurance  accounting and legal advice have increased 
we have also incurred costs which we have not previously incurred for director fees  investor relations expenses  expenses for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and rules implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange  and various other costs of a public company 
we incurred significant additional expenses in associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of other expenses in this annual report on form k  other expenses include equity based compensation costs associated with the vesting of event based awards plus amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of protego and braveheart 
these expenses for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
provision for income taxes prior to august   we had not been subject to us federal income tax  but had been subject to the new york city ubt and new york city general corporate tax on our us earnings  including certain non income tax fees in other jurisdictions where we had registered offices and conduct business 
our operations were historically organized as a series of partnerships  limited liability companies and subchapter s corporations 
taxes related to income earned by these entities represent obligations of the individual members  partners or shareholders and have not historically been reflected in the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements 
commencing august   evercore partners inc became subject to us corporate federal income tax on its allocable share of income 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities 
minority interest on a historical basis  our minority interest consisted of unaffiliated third party interests in the general partner of evp 
following the ipo  we no longer consolidate the general partner of that fund and  accordingly  minority interest related to evp is no longer reflected in our financial results 
we do  however  record significant minority interest relating to the ownership interest of our senior managing directors and their estate planning vehicles in evercore lp as well as the portion of pcb not owned by evercore 
as described in note to our combined consolidated financial statements herein  evercore partners inc is the sole general partner of evercore lp 
accordingly  although evercore partners inc has a minority economic interest in evercore lp  it has a majority voting interest and controls the management of evercore lp 
as a result  evercore partners inc consolidates evercore lp and records a minority interest for the economic interest in evercore lp held by the limited partners 
during  the vesting of additional evercore lp partnership units described above under operating expenses impact of the follow on offering resulted in an increase in the minority interest relating to the ownership interest of our senior managing directors and their estate planning vehicles in evercore lp 
this was partially offset by the exchange of our class a common stock for evercore lp partnership units and the purchase of additional evercore lp partnership units by us in conjunction with the follow on offering 
results of operations following is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december   and for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the revenue and operating expenses of our 
table of contents advisory and investment management business segments in these periods  see the discussion in business segments below 
historical results for periods prior to the ipo and subsequent thereto are not comparable 
for example  in results of operations for periods prior to our ipo on august   payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors were reflected as distributions to members  while such payments are reflected as compensation expense in subsequent periods 
operating expenses include a employee compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segments and b non compensation expenses  which include expenses for premises and occupancy  professional fees  travel and entertainment  communications and information services  equipment and indirect support costs including compensation and other operating expenses related thereto for administrative services 
such administrative services include  but are not limited to  accounting  tax  legal  facilities management and senior management activities 
other expenses include equity based compensation costs associated with event based awards plus amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of protego and braveheart

the company s professionals devote considerable time and resources to work closely with the portfolio company s management to assist in designing a business strategy  allocating capital and other resources  and evaluating expansion or acquisition opportunities 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a comprehensive analysis and valuation of all of the portfolio companies 
our analysis includes reviewing the current market conditions and valuations of each portfolio company with senior members of the company s investment management committee

exchange rate risk we have foreign operations in mexico and the united kingdom  their respective functional currencies are the mexican peso and british pound sterling 
we have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign exchange fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or otherwise 
an appreciation or depreciation of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar would result in an adverse or beneficial impact to the company s financial results 
a significant portion of the company s latin american revenues have been  and will continue to be  derived from contracts denominated in mexican pesos and evercore europe s revenue and expenses are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling and euro 
historically  the value of these foreign currencies has fluctuated relative to the us dollar

critical accounting policies and estimates the combined consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in conformity with us gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our combined consolidated financial statements and their notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition advisory revenue we earn advisory revenue through success fees based on the occurrence of certain events which may include announcements or completion of various types of financial transactions  retainer arrangements and fairness opinions 
we recognize advisory revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement with a client  agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded within other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and recognized as advisory revenue ratably over the period in which the related service is rendered 

table of contents investment management revenue our investment management business generates revenues from the management of the private equity funds and public securities asset management products 
private equity revenue sources include management and performance fees  portfolio company fees and gains losses on investments in private equity funds 
management fees are contractually based and are derived from investment management services provided in originating  recommending and consummating investment opportunities to private equity funds 
management fees are typically paid in advance on committed capital during the private equity funds investment period  and on invested capital  thereafter 
management fees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and revenue is recognized ratably  thereafter  over the period during which services are provided 
the management fees may provide for a management fee offset for certain portfolio company fees we earn 
we also record performance fee revenue from the private equity funds when the returns on the private equity funds investments exceed certain threshold minimums 
these performance fees  or carried interest  are computed in accordance with the underlying private equity funds partnership agreements and are based on investment performance over the life of each investment partnership 
performance fees are recorded as revenue as earned pursuant to the client agreements 
portfolio company fees include monitoring  director and transaction fees associated with services provided to the portfolio companies of the private equity funds we manage 
monitoring fees are earned for services provided to the portfolio companies with respect to the development and implementation of strategies for improving operating  marketing and financial performance 
monitoring fee revenue is recognized ratably over the period for which services are provided 
we earn transaction fees for providing advisory services to portfolio companies 
these fees are earned and recognized on the same basis as advisory revenue 
pcb s revenue sources include management fees and performance fees  which are accounted for similar to private equity revenue above 
interest revenue is derived from investing customer funds in financing transactions with pcb 
these transactions are primarily repurchases and resales of mexican government securities 
revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction 
valuation the valuation of our investments in securities and of our financial investments in the funds we manage impacts both the carrying value of direct investments and the determination of performance fees  also referred to as carried interest 
investments our investments  which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  consist of investments in private equity funds and our equity interest in eam 
we recognize our allocable share of the fair value of the private equity funds underlying investments as realized and unrealized gains or losses  which are reflected as revenue in the combined consolidated statements of operations 
we annually assess our equity method investments for impairment per accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the private equity funds consist primarily of investments in marketable and non marketable securities of the portfolio companies 
the underlying investments held by the private equity funds are valued based on quoted market prices or estimated fair value if there is no public market 
ultimately  we determine the fair value of the private equity funds investments in non marketable securities 
we determine the fair value of 
table of contents non marketable securities by giving consideration to a range of factors  including but not limited to  market conditions  operating performance current and projected and subsequent financing transactions 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of these non marketable securities  estimated values may materially differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments 
investments in publicly traded securities held by the private equity funds are valued using quoted market prices 
securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions 
the agreements provide that the transferor will receive substantially the same securities in return at the maturity of the agreement and the transferor will obtain from the transferee sufficient cash or collateral to purchase such securities during the term of the agreement 
these transactions are carried at the amounts at which the related securities will be subsequently resold or repurchased  plus accrued interest payable or receivable 
as these transactions are short term in nature  their carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value

sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no

 statement of cash flows sfas 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the combined consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
prior to the reorganization  we operated as a series of partnerships  limited liability companies and subchapter s corporations and had not historically issued stock based compensation awards 
we adopted sfas r on january  see key financial measures operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense for a discussion on expense related to vesting of evercore lp partnership units  rsus and shares of restricted stock that we recorded as a result of the completion of the follow on offering 
post reorganization  on august   we account for the unvested evercore lp partnership units as compensation paid to employees in accordance with sfas no 
r  which we adopted effective january  in accordance with sfas r  accruals of compensation costs for awards with a performance or service condition are based on the probable outcome of that service or performance condition 
compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and is not accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
see note to the combined consolidated financial statements herein for further information 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our combined consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is 
table of contents required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains on long term investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by us in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in order to determine the quarterly tax rate  we are required to estimate full year pre tax income and the related annual income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect our overall effective tax rate 
furthermore  our interpretation of complex tax laws may impact our measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
on january   we adopted fin fin provides a benefit recognition model with a two step approach consisting of more likely than not recognition criteria  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also requires the recognition of liabilities created by differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements 
see note to the combined consolidated financial statements herein in regard to the impact of the adoption of fin on our combined consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  we make estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and to project future earnings using valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model 
we use our best judgment and information available to us at the time to perform this review 
because our assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results could differ 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives which are periodically reevaluated 
for the year ended december   we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
recently issued accounting standards sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in addition  sfas disallows the use of block discounts when measuring financial instruments that trade with quoted prices in an active market 
sfas also requires the company to consider its own credit spreads when measuring the fair value of liabilities

we have adopted sfas in the first quarter of and do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas r in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas r applies to all transactions or other events in which the company obtains control of one or more businesses  including those sometimes referred to as true mergers or mergers of equals and combinations achieved without the transfer of consideration  for example  by contract alone or through the lapse of minority veto rights 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december  sfas in december  the fas issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which amends arb sfas requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling minority interests as equity as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests

management s report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  as such term is identified in exchange act rules a f 
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding preventions or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in making the assessment  management used the framework in internal control integrated framework promulgated by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  commonly referred to as the coso criteria

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls  material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
also  projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

table of contents changes in internal controls over financial reporting during  our management had identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  as defined in the standards established by the public company accounting oversight board 
during we identified areas of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that included a lack of an enterprise wide  executive driven internal control environment that documents key processes related to financial reporting and the lack of a formal  regular process designed to identify key financial reporting risks 
in addition  management concluded that there was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the fact that we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with experience to comply with us gaap and sec reporting requirements 
as of december   we have remediated the material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting that existed as of september  our remediation during and included in and  we augmented and hired additional accounting and finance resources and professionals  including a new chief financial officer  controller and sarbanes oxley compliance officer  within our accounting and finance organization  assessed the design of our internal control environment and established appropriate internal controls to achieve section compliance  established a number of formal committees to ensure proper protocols regarding control performance and changes to our risk profile  and enhanced our policies and processes related to financial reporting  implemented new procedures and began monitoring that all repurchases and reverse repurchase agreements at pcb were accounted for in accordance with us gaap  engaged a professional consulting firm to assist us in providing additional financial and accounting services to review the financial activities and transactions within protego  established new policies and procedures to ensure that all us gaap and sec matters as they arise are evaluated by the appropriate level of personnel  enhanced our training efforts to help ensure our key accounting and financial professionals can identify complex accounting matters as they arise  and enhanced our internal audit process to monitor financial reporting activities 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
