ownership and organizational structure our company including its predecessors has owned and operated television stations since a group of investors led by the predecessor of hmc acquired lin television corporation on march  on may   our company completed our initial public offering and our class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange 
we have three classes of common stock 
the class a common stock and the class c common stock are both voting common stock  with the class c common stock having of the aggregate voting power 
the class b common stock is held by affiliates of hmc and has no voting rights  except that without the consent of a majority of the class b common stock  we cannot enter into a wide range of corporate transactions

if affiliates of hmc converted their shares of class b common stock into shares of class a common stock and the shares of class c common stock were converted into shares of class a common stock as of march   the holders of the converted shares of class c common stock would own less than of the total outstanding shares of class a common stock and resulting voting power  and the affiliates of hmc would own of the total outstanding shares of class a common stock and resulting voting power

krqe tv includes two satellite stations  kbim tv and krez tv 
kxan tv includes a satellite station kxam tv 
we own and operate all of these satellite stations  which broadcast identical programming as the primary station  with the exception of local news insertions 
license renewal applications have been filed with the fcc and are currently pending 
license renewal granted pursuant to a tolling agreement with the fcc for the stations noted 
under these tolling agreements  the fcc granted each stations license renewal in return for our permitting the fcc two additional years from the date of the grant of the renewal to address certain outstanding enforcement proceedings from that previous license term 
we hold a equity interest  and a subsidiary of general electric company holds the remaining interest  in a joint venture which is a limited partner in a venture that owns television stations kxas tv  an nbc affiliate in dallas  and knsd tv  an nbc affiliate in san diego 
nbc universal is the general partner of the venture and operates the two stations pursuant to a management 
table of contents agreement 
general electric capital corporation gecc  another subsidiary of general electric company  provided debt financing for the joint venture in the form of an million  year non amortizing senior secured note bearing an interest rate of per annum until march  and per annum thereafter the gecc note 
we expect that the interest payments on the gecc note will be serviced solely by the cash flow of the joint venture 
all cash generated by the joint venture and available for distribution is distributed to us and nbc universal based on our respective equity interests 
during the year ended december   the venture generated million of income and received cash distributions of million from its equity investment in these stations  and the venture distributed million of cash to us 
description of our business strategy we seek to increase our revenues and cash flow through achievement of a number of key strategic and operating goals  including a growing the audiences for our television stations and internet websites and seeking new audience segments by using other forms of digital distribution  b increasing our advertising  digital and other revenues  and c continuing our implementation of cost efficiencies and use of new technology to streamline operations 
the principal components of our strategy are to maintain our local news franchises 
we operate the number one or number two local news station in of our markets and generated of our advertising revenues from our local news programming for the year ended december  we have been recognized for our local news expertise and have won many awards during the past year  including several associated press awards  two peabody awards and many local and regional awards 
we believe that successful local news programming is among the most important elements in attracting local advertising revenue 
in addition  news audiences serve as vital lead ins for other programming and help create a leading local station brand in the communities in which we operate  minimizing the impact of changes in the popularity of network programming on any particular station 
continue to pursue our multi channel strategy 
as a pioneer in the multi channel strategy  we have expanded our presence in our local markets beyond that of a single channel by a acquiring a second station  b programming  providing advertising sales and other related services for another station through a local marketing agreement  c acquiring a low power television station  or d creating local cable weather channels 
this added channel and distribution capacity allows us to appeal to a wider audience and market of advertisers while also providing us with economies of scale to pursue additional and new programming services 
as a result  we believe our duopoly stations provide us with a substantial competitive advantage in a number of markets where we have these additional stations and channels 
maintain our strong and diversified network relationships and programming 
we have stations affiliated with eight networks cbs  nbc  abc  fox  cw  mynetworktv  telefutura and univision 
many of these network affiliation relationships are long standing over years in length and provide our stations with high quality entertainment  strong national news and high profile sports event programming  many in high definition signal form  that further differentiate our stations as leaders in the local markets we serve 
we also believe that our affiliation diversification among all of the networks optimally balances our station portfolio  which results in our company not being exposed to short term programming or ratings changes that could otherwise impact our consolidated net revenues and cash flows 
sustain and grow our revenue share 
we have generally achieved revenue share greater than our audience share 
given our strong local station brands  market leading news and sales expertise in most of the markets we serve  our goal is to convert this audience share into an 
table of contents even greater share of advertising revenues 
as a result  we have typically been among the top stations in local and national advertising billing and market share in many of our markets 
reach new agreements for retransmission consent 
local broadcast stations reach nearly of us television households through carriage on cable  telecommunications and satellite multichannel video systems 
heightened local competition in the delivery of multichannel video and the economic interest of pay television companies in carrying both the analog and the high definition signals of broadcast television stations  combined with our strong local news rankings  duopoly station ownership positions and network affiliations  provide us with compelling negotiating positions to reach new retransmission consent agreements with these pay television companies for the carriage of our signals 
grow our internet business 
broadband penetration in most of our markets has grown substantially  making the internet available to most of our viewing audience 
our strong local television station brands and considerable news  sports  weather  traffic and other local video content  provides us with the ability to efficiently extend and leverage our station brands online 
we plan to further grow the internet portion of our business over the next several years by becoming one of the top destination websites in each of our local markets  adding more internet dedicated employees and launching new websites 
launch new digital services 
all but one of our stations have completed construction of their digital broadcast facilities 
in addition to high definition capability  digital transmissions can carry multiple program services and will eventually be able to transmit to mobile devices 
we believe there are a number of potentially attractive new video and data program services we can pursue that utilize the full capacity of our digital signals 
we also believe that because in our larger markets we have two digital channels  this gives us a particularly strong platform with which to launch these new services 
we expect to continue funding several research and development efforts in this area over the coming years to determine which new business applications are most advantageous for us 
further expand our regional television technology centers 
we operate two regional television technology centers that have centralized engineering  operations and administration for multiple stations at a single location 
in indianapolis and springfield  we service eleven stations and six stations  respectively 
we plan to further increase the productivity of these regional centers over time and believe we can accommodate more stations and functions in both regional centers 
continue to improve our cost efficiencies 
we have achieved company wide operating efficiencies by applying scale in the purchase of programming  ratings services  other research services  national sales representation  capital equipment and other vendor services 
we intend to continue this practice and seek new areas and ways to achieve improved cost efficiencies 
in  we centralized a number of additional back office functions  including station accounting  at our two shared services and accounting locations in providence and indianapolis 
principal sources of revenue local  national and political advertising revenues local  national and political advertising  net of agency commissions  represented approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we receive these revenues principally from advertising time sold in our local news  network and syndicated programming 
advertising rates are based upon a variety of factors  including size and demographic makeup of the market served by the television station  a program s popularity among television viewers  number of advertisers competing for the available time  
table of contents availability of alternative advertising media in the station s market area  our station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area  our station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting  and effectiveness of our sales force 
local television markets are defined by nielsen  an audience measurement service used by the television industry 
nielsen currently divides the us into approximately dmas and samples television audience viewing using electronic viewing devices or meters and viewing diaries 
nielsen publishes an audience viewing report for each dma for the months of february  may  july and november that includes the estimated television audiences for each local station and cable television network 
in addition  larger television markets  where the audience is measured by electronic meters  receive daily audience data feeds from nielsen 
network compensation the three oldest networks  abc  cbs and nbc  had historically made cash compensation payments for our carriage of their network programming 
however  in accordance with prevailing trends in our industry  our recent agreements with these networks now reflect a reduction and eventual elimination of network compensation payments to us and  in certain contract extensions  require us to pay compensation to the network 
in particular  the newer networks  such as fox  cw and mynetworktv  provide less network programming  pay no network compensation and  in some instances  require us to pay network compensation 
however  these newer networks provide us with more advertising inventory to sell than traditional networks 
barter revenues we occasionally barter our unsold advertising inventory for goods and services that are required to operate our television stations 
we also acquire certain syndicated programming by providing a portion of the available advertising inventory within the program  in lieu of cash payments 
digital revenues we generate digital revenues from advertising produced by our television stations internet websites and from retransmission consent fees received from cable  satellite and telecommunications companies for the rights to carry our analog and high definition signals in their pay television services to consumers 
other revenues we receive other revenues from sources such as renting space on our television towers  renting our production facilities  copyright royalties and providing television production services 
sources and availability of programming we program our television stations from the following program sources locally produced news and general entertainment programming that is produced by our local television stations  network programming  syndicated programming off network programs  such as the simpsons or everybody loves raymond  and first run programs  such as oprah  judge judy or wheel of fortune  
table of contents paid programming arrangements where a third party pays our stations for a block of time  generally in one half hour or one hour time periods to air long form advertising or infomercials  and local weather station we provide a hour weather channel to local cable systems in certain of our television markets 
locally produced news and general entertainment programming our stations produce an aggregate of hours of local news programming per week that we broadcast on all but three of our stations 
we believe that successful local news programming is an important element in attracting local advertising revenues 
in addition  our news programs which have had historically high ratings and strong viewership  have served as strong lead ins for other programs and have created strong local station brands in each of our local communities 
local news programming also allows us greater control over our programming costs 
our current network affiliations and number of weekly hours of network  local news and other local programming are as follows weekly weekly weekly network hours of hours of hours of affiliation dma network local news other local contract network dma rank station programming programming programming end date abc hartford new haven  ct wtnh tv grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  mi wotv tv cbs indianapolis  in wish tv albuquerque  nm krqe tv buffalo  ny wivb tv providence  ri new bedford  ma wpri tv fort wayne  in wane tv terre haute  in wthi tv lafayette  in wlfi tv nbc grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  mi wood tv norfolk portsmouth newport news  va wavy tv austin  tx kxan tv dayton  oh wdtn tv springfield holyoke  ma wwlp tv fox norfolk portsmouth newport news  va wvbt tv albuquerque  nm kasa tv providence  ri new bedford  ma wnac tv mobile pensacola  fl wala tv green bay  wi wluk tv toledo  ohio wupw tv cw columbus  oh wwho tv buffalo  ny wnlo tv austin  tx knva tv mobile  al pensacola  fl wbpg tv mynetworktv indianapolis  in wndy tv hartford new haven  ct wctx tv grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  mi wxsp ca telefutura austin  tx kbvo ca univision indianapolis  in wiih lp an affiliation agreement is currently being negotiated  we believe that we will be able to conclude an agreement with this network 

table of contents network programming all of our stations are affiliated with one of the national television networks 
our network affiliation agreements provide a local station exclusive rights and an obligation  subject to certain limited preemption rights  to carry the network programming 
while the networks retain most of the advertising time within their programs for their own use  the local station also has the right to sell a limited amount of advertising time within the network programs 
other time periods  which are not programmed by the networks  are programmed by the local station  for which the local station retains all of the advertising revenues 
the programming strength of a particular national television network may affect a local station s competitive position 
our stations  however  are diversified among the major and emerging networks  reducing the potential impact of any one network s performance 
we believe that national television network affiliations remain an efficient means of obtaining competitive programming  both for established stations with strong local news franchises and for newer stations with greater programming needs 
our stations generated an average of of their total net revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming for the year ended december  our stations that are affiliated with traditional broadcast networks generate a higher percentage of revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming than stations affiliated with the newer networks 
our affiliation agreements have terms with scheduled expiration dates ranging through december  these agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including a change of control of our company  which would generally result from the acquisition of of the voting rights of our company 
syndicated programming we acquire the rights to programs for time periods in which we do not air our local news or network programs 
these programs generally include reruns of current or former network programs  such as the simpsons or everybody loves raymond  or first run syndicated programs  such as oprah  judge judy or wheel of fortune 
we pay cash for these programs or exchange advertising time within the program for the cost of the program rights 
we compete with other local television stations to acquire these programs  which has caused the cost of program rights to increase over time 
in addition  a television viewer can now choose to watch many of these programs on national cable networks or purchase these programs on dvds or via downloads to computers or mobile video devices  which has contributed to increasing fragmentation of our local television audience 
distribution of programming the programming that airs on our television stations can reach the television audience by one or more of the following distribution systems full power television stations  local marketing agreements  low power television stations  cable television  satellite tv systems  internet  and telecommunications systems 

table of contents full power television stations we own and operate vhf full power television stations that operate on over the air channels through  and uhf full power television stations that operate on over the air channels through for the year ended december   our full power television stations generated of our net revenue  including two stations for which we provided programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements that contributed of our net revenue during see our television stations for a listing of our full power television stations 
local marketing agreements the fcc television licenses for the two stations for which we provide programming  sales and other related services under a local marketing agreement are not owned by us 
we incur programming costs  operating costs and the capital expenditures related to the operation of these stations  and retain all advertising revenues 
in providence and austin  the two local markets where these stations are currently located  we own and operate another station 
these local marketing agreement stations are an important part of our multi channel strategy 
we also have purchase options to acquire these stations 
in austin  we assigned our purchase option for knva tv to a third party  vaughan media  llc  that subsequently exercised the option to acquire the outstanding shares of the fcc licensee for that station 
the assignment and subsequent exercise of the option by vaughan media  llc are the subject of litigation between us  vaughan media llc and the licensee 
for more information  see item legal proceedings 
see government regulation of the television industry for a discussion of regulatory issues facing the commercial television broadcasting industry 
low power television stations we own and operate a number of low power television stations 
we operate these stations either as stand alone stations or as satellite stations 
these low power broadcast television stations are licensed by the fcc to provide service to substantially smaller areas than those of full power stations 
in four of our markets  albuquerque  austin  green bay and norfolk portsmouth newport news  we use our low power stations to extend the geographic reach of our primary stations in these markets 
in three of our markets  we have affiliated our low power stations with a national television network in indianapolis  we operate wiih tv  a single low power station affiliated with univision  which also utilizes cable carriage to cover that portion of the market it cannot reach over the air  in grand rapids  we operate wxsp tv  a group of low power television stations affiliated with mynetworktv  to cover substantially all of the local market  and in austin  in addition to operating one of our low power stations to extend the signal of kxan tv  we operate kbvo tv  a group of low power television stations affiliated with telefutura  to cover substantially all of the local market 
cable  satellite tv and telecommunications systems according to nielsen  cable and satellite tv system operators currently provide program services to approximately of total us television households  with cable systems serving and satellite tv systems serving 
as a result  cable  satellite tv and telecommunications systems are not only our primary competitors  but the primary way our television audience views our television stations 
we have carriage arrangements with over multiple system operators  the two major satellite tv system providers and telecommunications systems 
these arrangements are of two different types must carry and retransmission consent 
under must carry arrangements  the stations invoke an fcc rule requiring carriage by the cable system or satellite provider of local stations in their local markets and requiring local stations be carried on certain channels and on tiers of service available to all 
table of contents subscribers 
cable and satellite system providers do not pay a fee for station carriage under must carry arrangements 
under retransmission consent arrangements  stations waive their must carry rights and elect to be carried by the cable or satellite system provider under negotiated contractual terms 
these terms may include not just agreements with respect to channel positioning and service tier carriage but other compensation  such as cash payments for our stations or carriage for another program service  advertising payments or joint promotional commitments 
we are required to make must carry or retransmission consent elections every three years  with the next election to be made by october   to become effective january  however  most of our stations are currently operating under month to month extensions of retransmission consent agreements with cable companies for carriage of our analog signals only  these cable companies do not have the rights to carry our high definition signals 
seasonality of our business our advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each calendar year  due generally to higher advertising in the spring season and due to increases in retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the end of year holiday season 
our operating results are also significantly affected by annual cycles  as advertising revenues are generally higher in even numbered years ie   due to additional revenues associated with election years and advertising spending by political candidates and incremental advertising revenues associated with olympic broadcasts 
the broadcast television industry is also cyclical in nature and affected by prevailing economic conditions 
since we rely on sales of advertising time for substantially all of our revenues  our operating results are sensitive to general economic and regional conditions in each local market where our stations operate 
digital transition of our stations the fcc granted most broadcast television stations a second channel to facilitate the transition from analog to digital transmission 
on february   a measure was signed into law that set an unconditional digital conversion date of february  the transition date and included a program to subsidize the digital conversion of remaining analog receivers 
as of december   we have successfully converted all of the full power stations that we own and operate to digital with the exception of wbpg tv in mobile pensacola  which has not yet completed its digital construction 
wbpg tv has just recently been allotted a digital channel by the fcc  and may not be permitted to initiate digital transmissions until shortly before or on february  further  in order to optimize signal coverage  wnac tv  wthi tv  wluk tv and krqe tv including a satellite station of krqe tv  all of which currently operate uhf digital stations  will go through further changes to move their digital operations to their present vhf analog channel 
in addition  wnac tv will use wpri tv s analog channel lastly  wane tv is awaiting the grant of a construction permit to operate at the legal maximum power currently allowed 
all six of these stations have been granted their desired channel assignments 
the costs associated with conversion of these stations to their final digital operation are estimated at million over the next eighteen months 
we also own and operate many low power translator stations as part of these full power stations 
we will incur an additional cost of approximately million over the next two years to convert these translator stations to digital 
during  the fcc allowed the broadcast industry to file applications to modify low power stations to digital 
most of our stations were able to apply to operate our existing low power stations as digital channels 
however  some of our low power stations could not operate digitally on their current channel because the channel is not included in the fcc s revised channel plan channels to that will be in effect after february   or the channel would have an interference problem after digital conversion 
for these low power stations  we were able to request what the fcc terms a companion 
table of contents channel 
with the companion channel  low power stations can operate digitally on a new channel 
in the case of our low power stations  most filed to stay on their existing channels and the remainder were granted a companion channel 
in some cases our low power stations will be able to extend their coverage beyond that presently offered by the station s existing analog channel 
the cost to convert these stations to digital operation is expected to be a maximum of million over the next two years 
competitive conditions in the television industry the television broadcast industry has become highly competitive over the past ten years as a result of new technologies and new program distribution systems 
local cable systems  which offer television viewers hundreds of program choices  compete for advertising dollars 
in most of our local markets  we compete directly against other local broadcast stations  cable systems and satellite tv systems 
we believe  however  that our local news programming  network affiliations and sales management have enabled us to compete effectively in our markets 
the chart below illustrates some of the competitive forces that we face in terms of audience  advertising revenues and programming 
competition for viewing advertising time revenues programming other local television stations x x x cable television networks x x x local cable systems x x local telecommunications systems x x satellite tv systems x x internet x x x videogame systems eg playstation x dvds x computers and mobile video devices eg ipods x local radio stations x newspapers x outdoor advertising x government regulation of the television industry overview of regulatory issues the ownership  operation and sale of television stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc by authority granted it under the communications act 
matters subject to fcc oversight include  but are not limited to allocating frequency bands to broadcast television  allotting specific channels frequencies to specific cities  and approving the location  operating power and types of transmission of each television station  establishing limits on the number of television stations which may be owned nationally and in each local market either separately or in conjunction with other media  establishing eligibility criteria for ownership of broadcast television station licenses and approving license renewals and transfers  enforcing various broadcast programming content laws or regulations including those barring or restricting obscene or indecent content  mandating children s educational programming and regulating advertising directed at children  and overseeing certain broadcast employment regulations 

table of contents the fcc has the power to impose penalties  including fines or license revocations  upon a licensee of a television station for violations of the communications act and the fcc s rules and regulations 
license renewal  assignment and transfer of broadcast licenses television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior fcc approval 
in determining whether to grant or renew a broadcast license  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the applicant  including compliance with a variety of ownership limitations and compliance with character and technical standards 
during certain limited periods when a renewal application is pending  petitions to deny a license renewal may be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
the fcc must grant the renewal application if it finds that the incumbent has served the public interest and has not committed any serious violation of fcc rules 
if the incumbent fails to meet that standard  and if it does not show other mitigating factors warranting a lesser sanction  the fcc has authority to deny the renewal application 
we are in good standing with respect to each of our fcc licenses 
our licenses have expiration dates ranging between and the table on page includes the expiration date of each of our licenses 
we have timely filed license renewal applications for each of our stations 
once an application for renewal is filed  each station remains licensed while its application is pending  even after its license expiration date has passed 
we expect to renew each of these licenses but we make no assurance that we will be able to do so 
certain of our licenses have pending applications for renewal that we expect to be reviewed and granted in regulation of ownership of broadcast licenses on a national level  fcc rules generally prevent an entity or individual from having an attributable interest in television stations that collectively have an aggregate audience reach in excess of of all us households 
for this purpose only of the television households in a market are counted towards the national restriction if the station in that market is a uhf station 
the percentage of all us households that our stations reach is approximately 
the fcc s duopoly rule generally prohibits or restricts an entity from having attributable interests in two or more television stations in the same local market 
the rule permits ownership of two television stations in a local market under certain circumstances  primarily where a party is seeking to combine two stations if at least one of the stations is not among the top four in audience and there are at least eight post merger  independently owned television operations 
waivers of the rule are also available where one of the stations has failed  is failing or is unbuilt 
local marketing agreements are considered equivalent to ownership for purposes of the local ownership rules and thus  subject to certain exceptions  are permissible only where ownership is permissible 
the fcc has grandfathered otherwise ineligible television local marketing agreements entered into prior to november   until at least after the conclusion of a rulemaking  to be initiated at a date yet to be determined  examining whether it would be in the public interest to permit such combinations to continue 
grandfathered local marketing agreements can be freely transferred during the grandfather period  but duopolies may be transferred only where the two station combination continues to qualify under the duopoly rule 
we have acquired four of our stations that we had previously provided programming  sales and other related services for under a local marketing agreement 
three markets  grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  norfolk portsmouth newport news and albuquerque satisfied the requirement for a sufficient number of post merger  independently owned television stations and did not require waivers of the duopoly rule for conversion to ownership or subsequent transferability 
the station in new haven applied for and was granted an unbuilt station duopoly waiver 
a subsequent transfer of the duopoly in new haven may require a waiver if no additional independent stations initiate operations in the market 
eligibility for a waiver will depend upon the station s future performance 
in the event that the fcc determines that the grandfathered local marketing agreement in providence is ineligible for conversion to full ownership  we have the right to assign our purchase option to a third party and we 
table of contents believe we can arrange a suitable disposition  including alternative non attributable operating arrangements with such a party  such as a more limited programming and services agreement or joint sales agreement  if necessary  which will not be materially less favorable to us than the current local marketing agreement 
however  the rules may not be implemented or interpreted in such a manner 
in austin  we assigned our purchase option for knva tv to a third party  vaughan media  llc  that subsequently exercised the option to acquire the outstanding shares of the fcc licensee for that station 
the assignment and subsequent exercise of the option by vaughan media  llc are the subject of litigation between us  vaughan media  llc and the licensee 
for more information see item legal proceedings 
the fcc also limits the combined local ownership of a newspaper and a broadcast radio or television station 
in addition  it limits the number of radio stations that may be co owned with a television station serving the same local market 
in  the fcc voted to revise and in most cases liberalize substantially several of its national and local ownership rules 
in  the united states court of appeals found virtually all of these actions to be without adequate support and remanded to the fcc for further deliberation 
in  the united states supreme court declined to hear an appeal of the court of appeals decision 
in june  the fcc adopted a further rule making proceeding to reexamine the ownership rules in light of the court decision 
in december  the fcc brought this proceeding to a close by making only moderate changes to the newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule and leaving the other rules unchanged 
in  congress by statute fixed the limit on nationwide ownership of television broadcast stations at of all us households and the fcc has conformed its rules to that statute 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits only to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
in the case of corporations holding broadcast licenses  the interest of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly  have the right to vote or more of the corporation s voting stock  or or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies  mutual funds  bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that are holding stock for investment purposes only  are generally deemed to be attributable  as are positions as an officer or director of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee 
debt and non voting stock are generally non attributable interests 
moreover  pending completion of a court ordered rule making  the fcc has restored an exemption to attribution of voting stock in any entity that has a single shareholder with more than of that entity s voting stock 
in any event  the holder of an otherwise non attributable stock or debt interest in a licensee which is in excess of of the total assets of the licensee debt plus equity will nonetheless be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or newspaper in the same market 
while intending to provide licensees and investors with clear attribution standards  the fcc has stated that it reserves the authority  in an appropriate case  to declare as being attributable an unusual combination of otherwise non attributable interests 
because of these multiple and cross ownership rules  any person or entity that acquires an attributable interest in us may violate the fcc s rules if that purchaser also has an attributable interest in other television or radio stations  or in daily newspapers  depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers 
such person or entity also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest 
if the holder of an attributable interest violates any of these ownership rules or if a proposed acquisition by us would cause such a violation  we may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct our television station business and may be unable to obtain the fcc s consents for certain future acquisitions 
regulatory issues involving alien ownership the communications act restricts the ability of foreign entities or individuals to own or vote certain interests in broadcast licenses 
a foreign corporation or non us citizen cannot own more than of 
table of contents a corporation that holds a broadcast license 
also  no corporation may hold the capital stock of another corporation holding a broadcast license if more than of the capital stock of such parent corporation is owned by a foreign corporation or non us citizen absent specific fcc authorization 
regulatory issues involving programming and station operations the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
since the early s  the fcc gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station s local market 
broadcast station licensees continue  however  to be required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
complaints from viewers concerning a station s programming may be considered by the fcc when it evaluates license renewal applications  although such complaints may be filed  and generally may be considered by the fcc  at any time 
stations also must follow various rules promulgated under the communications act that regulate  among other things  children s television programming and advertising  political advertising  sponsorship identifications  contest and lottery advertising and program ratings guidelines 
the commission recently proposed to re establish a number of formalized procedures designed to improve television broadcasters service to their local communities 
these proposals include the establishment of community advisory boards  quantitative programming guidelines and maintenance of a main studio in a station s community of license 
we are unable to predict which  if any  of these proposals the fcc will ultimately adopt and whether such final rules will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 
the fcc is in the process of determining what  if any  additional public interest programming obligations will be imposed on digital broadcast transmissions 
the fcc determined that broadcasters who carry multiple programs on their digital facilities must provide additional children s educational programming 
the fcc is also charged with enforcing restrictions or prohibitions on the broadcast of obscene and indecent programs and in recent years has increased its enforcement activities in this area  issuing large fines against radio and television stations found to have carried such programming 
congress adopted legislation  which president bush signed into law in june  which increased the maximum monetary penalty for carriage of indecent programming tenfold to  per station per violation and put the licenses of repeat offenders in jeopardy 
the fcc adopted the increased forfeiture amount in june of court challenges to the fcc s indecency enforcement regime are pending at various stages 
we are unable to predict whether the enforcement of the indecency regulations will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 
the fcc has suggested that violent programming may be regulated in the same manner that indecent programming is now  according to a report to congress released in april congress has not yet taken action on the recommendations made in the report 
we are unable to predict whether the adoption and enforcement of such regulations would have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 
the fcc also requires broadcast stations to comply with its own set of equal employment opportunity outreach rules and has adopted standards regulating the exposure of station employees and the public to potentially harmful radio frequency radiation emitted by our broadcast facilities 
regulatory restrictions on broadcast advertising the advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco on broadcast stations is banned 
congressional committees have examined legislative proposals to eliminate or severely restrict the advertising of beer and wine 
we cannot predict whether any such proposals will be enacted into law and  if so  what the final form of such law might be 
the elimination of all beer and wine advertising could have an adverse effect on our stations revenues and operating profits 
campaign finance legislation  which 
table of contents became effective in november  restricts spending by candidates  political parties  independent groups and others on political advertising and imposes significant reporting and other burdens on political advertising 
this legislation was upheld by the supreme court  but found the legislation unconstitutional to the extent it prohibited corporate expenditure on issue ads mentioning the names of candidates during specified dates during the election cycle 
the legislation is still subject to further restrictive interpretation by the federal election commission  whose actions we cannot predict 
regulatory issues involving cable must carry or retransmission consent rights the cable act of requires television broadcasters to make an election to exercise either must carry or retransmission consent rights in connection with their carriage by cable television systems in the station s local market 
if a broadcaster chooses to exercise its must carry rights  it may demand carriage on a specified channel on cable systems within its local market 
must carry rights are not absolute 
cable systems may decline carriage for a variety of reasons  including a lack of channel capacity for smaller systems  the inability of the station asserting must carry rights to deliver a good quality signal to the cable system or the presence of a more proximate duplicate affiliate of the same network 
stations asserting must carry rights are not permitted to receive additional compensation from the cable systems carrying their stations 
if a station owner chooses to exercise its retransmission consent rights  it may prohibit cable systems from carrying its signal  or permit carriage under a negotiated compensation arrangement 
must carry rights are limited to carriage within a station s local market and preclude a station from receiving anything other than limited carriage rights in exchange for the use of its programming 
must carry is generally elected in instances where the broadcast station believes it is unlikely to obtain either cost free carriage or additional compensation through negotiation 
this is more likely to be the case with respect to stations which have disadvantaged signals or channel positions  or which are without strong networks  or local news operations and to systems in areas dominated by a single cable operator  or where there are overlapping signals from stations in adjacent markets 
otherwise  stations generally elect to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable systems 
a retransmission consent agreement  by contrast  is generally elected where a station seeks not just carriage but compensation from the cable system 
retransmission consent agreements are also required for carriage on systems outside of a station s local market 
compensation may include cash or other forms of payment  enhanced channel position  or carriage of and payment for additional program services such as a local weather service or a second national network carried on a low power station in the same market 
we currently have retransmission consent agreements with virtually all distributors cable  telecommunications and satellite in our local markets 
however  there are a number of cable operators comprising the majority of the paid subscribers for our stations carrying our stations pursuant to short term retransmission extensions 
regulatory issues involving satellite tv systems there are currently two satellite video service providers covering the us market directv and dish network 
these satellite video service systems deliver subscription programming similar to that of cable systems to consumers who have purchased and installed a small satellite dish and receiver 
in addition to providing the national cable channels ie espn  msnbc  discovery channel  etc  satellite video service providers carry most of the local broadcast signals in the markets they serve 
the satellite compulsory license permits satellite video service systems to provide local signals into only their local markets  which is called the local in local provision  and prohibits the importation of distant stations into a local market 
as with cable carriage  broadcasters have been given the right to negotiate retransmission consent for their local signals in exchange for compensation or to demand carriage as a matter of right for no compensation 
both directv and dish network have now initiated carriage of local stations in most of our markets and we have retransmission consent agreements with both companies for the carriage of our signals that have scheduled expiration dates ranging through february  
table of contents regulatory network affiliate issues several fcc rules impose restrictions on network affiliation agreements 
among other things  those rules prohibit a television station from entering into any affiliation agreement that requires the station to clear time for network programming that the station had previously scheduled for other use  or precludes the preemption of any network programs that the station believes are unsuitable for its audience and the substitution of network programming with programming that it believes is of greater local or national importance 
the fcc is currently reviewing its rules governing the relationship between broadcast television networks and their affiliates 
we are unable to predict when and how the fcc will resolve these matters 
regulatory issues involving the transition to digital television all us television stations broadcast signals using an analog transmission system first developed in the s 
the fcc has approved a new digital television  or dtv  technical standard to be used by television broadcasters  television set manufacturers  the computer industry and the motion picture industry 
this dtv standard allows the simultaneous transmission of higher quality and or multiple streams of video programming and data on the bandwidth presently used by a single analog channel 
on the multiple channels allowed by dtv  it is possible to broadcast one high definition channel  with visual and sound quality substantially superior to present day television  to transmit several standard definition channels  with digital sound and pictures of a quality varying from equivalent to somewhat better than present television  to provide interactive data services  including visual or audio transmission  or to provide some combination of these possibilities 
the fcc has already allocated to nearly every existing television broadcast station one additional channel to be used for dtv during the transition between present day analog television and dtv  and has established a timetable by which every current station must initiate dtv operations 
broadcasters were not required to pay for this new dtv channel  but will be required to relinquish their analog channel on february  the fcc has declared its intention to place all dtv stations in a core broadcast band consisting of channels by february  and to reallocate channels to a variety of other uses  including advanced cellular telephone and public safety 
broadcasters must also pay certain fees for non broadcast uses of their digital channels 
in addition  the fcc recently determined that broadcasters who transmit multiple programs on their digital channels are required to carry additional children s educational programming and is evaluating whether to impose further public interest programming requirements on digital broadcasters 
the fcc also recently held that the must carry requirements applicable to cable and satellite carriage of analog broadcast signals will encompass only the primary digital program channel  and then only upon the cessation of analog signals 
the fcc s current implementation plan would maintain the secondary status of low power television stations with respect to dtv operations and many low power television stations  particularly in major markets  will be displaced  including some of ours 
pursuant to the telecommunications act  the fcc must conduct a ten year evaluation regarding the public interest in advanced television  alternative uses for the spectrum and reduction of the amount of spectrum each licensee utilizes 
many segments of the industry are also intensely studying these advanced technologies 
there can be no assurances regarding the nature of future fcc regulation as a result of this study 

table of contents recent regulatory developments  proposed legislation and regulation congress and the fcc currently have under consideration  and may in the future adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation and ownership of our stations 
in addition to the changes and proposed changes noted above  the fcc has considered  for example  spectrum use fees  political advertising rates and potential restrictions on the advertising of certain products like hard liquor  beer and wine that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
the fcc also plans to commence proceedings to consider several other matters including whether embedded advertising violates sponsorship identification rules  in state television signal availability where signals carried by cable or satellite originate out of state and network affiliate issues 
in addition  other matters that could affect stations include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry 
the foregoing does not purport to be a complete summary of all the provisions of the communications act  as amended by the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act or the cable act  or of the regulations and policies of the fcc under either act 
proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before and are being considered by congress and federal regulatory agencies from time to time 
we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of any of the pending fcc rule making proceedings referenced above  the outcome of any reconsideration or appellate proceedings concerning any changes in fcc rules or policies noted above  the possible outcome of any proposed or pending congressional legislation  or the impact of any of those changes on our stations

item a 
risk factors risks associated with our business activities our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues  which can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control 
as a result  we may be more vulnerable to downturns than businesses in other industries 
advertising volatility based on general and local economic conditions  and program ratings could affect our operating results and may make it difficult for us to repay our debt obligations  or cause the value of our common stock to decline 
our ability to generate advertising revenues depends on factors such as national and local economic conditions  the relative popularity of the programming on our stations  the demographic characteristics of our markets  and the activities of our competitors 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership or we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline 
we  and those on whom we rely for programming  may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in viewer tastes and interests of our local markets 
in addition  political advertising revenue from elections and advertising revenues from olympic games  which generally occur on the even years  create large fluctuations in our operating results on a year to year basis 
we depend to a significant degree on automotive advertising 
approximately  and of our net revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant decrease in these revenues in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  which could affect our ability to fund operations and service our debt obligations and affect the value of our common stock 
if we are unable to reach retransmission consent agreements with cable  and other pay television companies for the carriage of our stations signals  we could lose audience share and revenues 
in connection with the distribution of local broadcast television station signals to cable television and other pay television services in individual markets  the communications act permits the stations to choose either mandatory carriage must carry or retransmission consent 
under must carry  the station informs the cable or pay television company that the station s signal is required to be distributed to the company s subscribers  but there is no compensation to the station for such distribution 
under retransmission consent  the station notifies the local cable or pay television company that it elects to begin negotiations to determine if they can agree on the economic terms under which the cable or pay television company will be given permission to distribute the broadcast 
table of contents station s signals  either analog or high definition  or both  to the company s subscribers 
if no agreement is reached  the cable or pay television company cannot distribute the station s signal to its subscribers and the broadcast station must rely on its over the air signal and other forms of competitive distribution satellite tv systems and telecommunications to reach its audience and provide programming and advertising 
if we enter into retransmission consent negotiations with a number of local cable and pay television companies but are unable to reach agreement with respect to economic terms for the carriage of our station signals  our local television station audience  ratings and advertising revenues could substantially decline and there could be a material adverse impact to our results of operations 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  reduce our operating flexibility and put us at greater risk for default and acceleration of our debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness and approximately million of consolidated stockholders equity 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
accordingly  we will continue to have significant debt service obligations 
our large amount of indebtedness could  for example require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on indebtedness and reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate activities  require us to dispose of television stations or other assets at times or on terms that may be less advantageous than those we might otherwise be able to obtain  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  expose us to greater interest rate risk  since the interest rates on our credit facility vary  and impair our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general and place us at a disadvantage relative to our less leveraged competitors 
in addition  our debt instruments require us to comply with covenants  including  among others  those that restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations and make capital expenditures 
these covenants restrict the manner in which we conduct our business and may impact our operating results 
further  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our indebtedness under our debt agreements or under other instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
in the past  we have obtained amendments with respect to compliance with financial ratio tests in our credit facility 
consents or amendments that may be required in the future may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
our indentures also have change of control provisions which may require us to purchase all or a portion of our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated notes class b at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
the holders of our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures can also require us to repurchase all or a portion of the debentures  totaling million  on each of may     and any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  forcing us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  or to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  will be subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow  or refinance our indebtedness  or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms  we may have to seek to restructure our remaining debt obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the market  if any  for our debt 
the recent sub prime mortgage market crisis and its pervasive effect on general credit market liquidity may also impact our ability to refinance our debt or to refinance our debt on terms similar to our existing debt agreements 
we have a history of net losses and a substantial accumulated deficit 
we had net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of impairment of our broadcast licenses and goodwill  and interest expense 
in addition  as of december  and  we had accumulated deficits of million and million  respectively 
these losses may or may not recur  and our net losses and accumulated deficit may therefore continue indefinitely 
as a result  we may not have sufficient funds to operate our business 
we have a material amount of intangible assets and we have recorded substantial impairments in prior periods 
future write downs of intangible assets would reduce net income  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our class a common stock 
approximately billion  or of our total assets as of december  consists of unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires  among other things  that goodwill and certain other intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or the intangible asset over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant 
future impairment charges could significantly adversely impact our reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
we recorded an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million during the year ended december  and we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our class a common stock traded at a price that resulted in a market capitalization less than our total stockholders equity as of december  if we determine in a future period as part of our testing for impairments of intangible assets and goodwill  that the carrying amount of our intangible assets exceeds the fair value of these assets  we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our class a common stock 
our strategy has historically included seeking growth through acquisitions of television stations  which could pose various risks and increase our leverage 
we have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue acquisitions of television stations with the goal of improving their operating performance by applying our management s business and growth 
table of contents strategy 
we acquired seven television stations during the last several years 
we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets nor have the financial capacity to complete additional station acquisitions 
acquisitions involve inherent risks  such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls  increase advertising revenues or increase audience share with respect to any acquired stations 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management s attention from the operation of our core business 
in addition  television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television stations if the fcc believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
broadcast interests of our affiliates  including hmc  may be attributable to us and may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our growth strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable to those persons under fcc rules 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
the broadcast or other media interests of our officers  directors and or greater voting stockholders are generally attributable to us  which may limit our acquisition or ownership of television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of an otherwise non attributable equity or debt interest in a licensee which is in excess of of total debt and equity of the licensee will nonetheless be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station or newspaper in the same market 
as of march   affiliates of hmc owned  shares of our non voting class b common stock  which represents of our capital stock  and one share of our class c common stock  which represents less than of our capital stock  but represents of the outstanding voting power 
hmc and its affiliates  whose interests may differ from your interests  have approval rights with respect to significant transactions and could convert their equity interests in our company into a majority of voting power  thereby reducing the voting power of our other shareholders 
hmc and its affiliates own one share of our class c common stock  which represents of our outstanding voting power  and also have the ability to convert shares of our non voting class b common stock into class a common stock  subject to fcc approval 
upon the conversion of the majority of the non voting class b common stock into class a common stock  the class c common stock will automatically convert into an equal number of shares of class a common stock 
if this occurs  affiliates of hmc would own approximately of our voting equity interests and will effectively have the ability to elect the entire board of directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of hmc and its affiliates may differ from the interests of our other stockholders and hmc and its affiliates could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our other stockholders 
for example  hmc is in the business of making significant investments in existing or newly formed companies and may from time to time acquire and hold controlling or non controlling interests in television broadcast assets that may directly or indirectly compete with our company for advertising revenues 
in addition  hmc and its affiliates may from time to time identify  pursue and consummate 
table of contents acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
moreover  royal w 
carson  iii  a director  and hmc  combined own all of our class c common stock and therefore possess of the combined voting power 
accordingly  mr 
carson and hmc together have the power to elect our entire board of directors and  through this control  to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
mr 
carson has prior business relations with hmc 
mr 
carson is the president of carson private capital incorporated  an investment firm that sponsors funds of funds and dedicated funds that have invested substantially all of the net capital of these funds in private equity investment funds sponsored by firms like hmc or its affiliates 
mr 
carson also serves on an advisory board representing the interests of limited partners of hicks  muse  tate furst equity fund v  lp  sector performance fund  lp  and hicks  muse  tate furst europe fund lp  which are sponsored by hmc 
the three listed funds do not have an investment in us 
in addition  peter s 
brodsky  one of our directors  is a partner of hmc 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue could decline 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  is highly competitive and is undergoing a period of consolidation and significant change 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment alternatives  such as cable  satellite and telecommunications video services  internet  wireless  pay per view and video on demand  digital video recorders  dvds and mobile video devices have fragmented television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to new types of competition 
new technologies may affect our broadcasting operations 
our television broadcasting business is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and the emergence of new technologies 
we cannot predict the effect such technologies will have on our broadcast operations  but the capital expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to could aggressively compete with our business 
it would be difficult to take us over  which could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
affiliates of hmc effectively have the ability to determine whether a change of control will occur through their ownership of one of the two outstanding shares of our class c common stock and all of the shares of our class b common stock 
provisions of delaware corporate law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation  including the voting power rights of our class c common stock held by mr 
carson and hmc and the voting power that affiliates of hmc would hold upon conversion of their shares of class b stock into class a stock or class c stock  make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would benefit the holders of our class a common stock 
these provisions and controlling ownership by affiliates of hmc could also adversely affect the public trading price of our class a common stock 
the loss of network affiliation agreements or changes in network affiliations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to quickly replace the network affiliation 
the non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material adverse effect on us 
each of the networks generally provides our affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  our stations broadcast 
table of contents network inserted commercials during that programming and  in some cases  receive cash payments from networks  and in other cases  we make cash payments to certain networks 
in addition  some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including as a result of a change of control of our company  which would generally result upon the acquisition of of our voting power 
in the event that affiliates of hmc elect to convert our class b common stock shares held by them into shares of either class a common stock or class c common stock  such conversion may result in a change of control of our company causing an early termination of some or all of our network affiliation agreements 
some of the networks with which our stations are affiliated have required us  upon renewal of affiliation agreements  to reduce or eliminate network compensation and  in specific cases  to make cash payments to the network  and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements 
consequently  our affiliation agreements may not all remain in place and each network may not continue to provide programming or compensation to us on the same basis as it currently provides programming or compensation to our stations 
if any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include a increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  b short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  c costs of building a new or larger news operation  d other increases in station programming costs  if necessary  and e the cost of equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major network s share of the audience that changes from year to year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle  and the audience acceptance of new programs in the future and the fact that national network audience ratings are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
how well a particular network fares in an affiliation switch depends largely on the value of the broadcast license  which is influenced by the length of time the television station has been broadcasting  whether it is a vhf or a uhf license  the quality and location of the license  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station and the quality of the station non network programming 
in addition  the majority of the revenue earned by television stations is attributable to locally produced news and syndicated programming  rather than to network affiliation payments and advertising sales related to network programming 
the circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by us and  if these costs are significant  the switch could have a material adverse impact on the income we derive from the affected station 
the use of an alternative method of valuing our network affiliations could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
some broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market  the length of time that the broadcast license has been broadcasting  whether the station is a vhf station or a uhf station  
table of contents the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within the market  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station  and the quality of non network programming carried by a station 
we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we have used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all of the markets in which we operate  beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more or less favorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
if we were to adopt this alternative method for valuing network affiliations  the value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill as reported on our balance sheet would be reduced and the value of our other intangible assets would be proportionately increased 
as a result  our expenses relating to the amortization of intangible assets could increase significantly as more value would be assigned to an amortizing asset and this increase could materially reduce our operating income and net income 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different factors and circumstances for each station and market being evaluated 
the gecc note could result in significant liabilities and could trigger a change of control under our existing indebtedness  causing our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 
gecc provided debt financing for a joint venture between us and nbc universal  another subsidiary of general electric company  in the form of an million  non amortizing senior secured note due  which is an obligation of the joint venture and not us 
in the event that such note is not extended or otherwise refinanced when the note matures in  we expect that  assuming current federal marginal tax rates remain in effect  our tax liability related to the joint venture transaction will be approximately million 
however  any early repayment of the note will accelerate this tax liability  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
annual cash interest payments on the note are approximately million 
there are no scheduled payments of principal prior to  the stated maturity of the note 
the obligations under the note were assumed by the joint venture  and the proceeds were used to finance a portion of the cost of hmc s acquisition of lin television corporation 
the note is not our obligation nor the obligation of any of our subsidiaries and has recourse only to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint 
table of contents venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interest in the joint venture  to our company pursuant to a guarantee  which could trigger the change of control provisions under our existing indebtedness 
an event of default under the note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled payment of interest  within days of the date due and payable  or principal of the note on the maturity date 
the joint venture had cash balances at december  of million for the purpose of making interest payments on the note when due 
both nbc universal and us have the right to make a shortfall loan to the joint venture to cover any interest payment 
however  if the joint venture fails to pay principal or interest on the note  and neither nbc universal nor us make a shortfall loan to cover the interest payment  an event of default would occur and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited prior to its stated maturity 
risks related to our industry our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs  and increased programming costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs 
we often acquire program rights two or three years in advance  making it difficult for us to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  we may have to replace programs before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in impairments and write offs that increase station operating costs 
we may be exposed to future programming cost increases  which may adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to a government mandated analog to digital conversion process which may cause us to lose viewership and advertising revenues 
federal legislation now requires us to cease all analog transmissions by february  approximately of television households  in markets where we own and operate television stations  receive our television station signal exclusively by over the air transmission 
in addition  millions of additional households who subscribe to cable or satellite tv systems also have additional televisions which receive over the air transmissions 
households without satellite tv systems or cable service are substantially greater viewers of local stations  such as ours  than satellite tv systems or cable households 
the federal government has created a subsidy for households with analog over the air receivers to receive free digital converters 
the subsidy may not be large enough to cover all households with over the air receivers and a significant percentage of such households may not learn of  or choose to take advantage of the subsidy 
as a result  the transition to digital may cause some households to lose service and induce others to subscribe to satellite or cable service  potentially reducing our viewership and advertising revenues 
implementation of digital television improves the technical quality of over the air broadcast television 
however  conversion to digital operations may reduce a station s geographical coverage area 
we believe that digital television is essential to our long term viability and that of the broadcast industry in general  but we cannot predict the precise effect digital television might have on our business 
the fcc has levied fees on broadcasters with respect to non broadcast uses of digital channels  including data transmissions or subscriber services 
further advances in technology may also increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 
we are unable to predict the effect that technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or the future results of our operations 
changes in fcc ownership rules through fcc action  judicial review or federal legislation may limit our ability to continue providing services to stations under local marketing agreements  may prevent us from obtaining ownership of the stations we currently provide services to under local marketing agreements and or may preclude us from obtaining the full economic 
table of contents value of one or more of our duopoly  or two station operations upon a sale  merger or other similar transaction transferring ownership of such station or stations 
fcc ownership rules currently impose significant limitations on the ability of broadcast licensees to have attributable interests in multiple media properties 
in addition  federal law prohibits one company from owning broadcast television stations that collectively have service areas encompassing more than an aggregate share of national television households 
ownership restrictions under fcc rules also include a variety of local limits on media ownership 
the restrictions include an ownership limit of one television station in most medium and smaller television markets and two stations in most larger markets  known as the television duopoly rule 
the regulations also include a prohibition on the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market newspaper television cross ownership  limits on common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market radio television station ownership and limits on radio ownership of four to eight radio stations in a local market 
in  the fcc voted to revise and in most cases liberalize substantially several of its national and local ownership rules 
in  the united states court of appeals found virtually all of these actions to be without adequate support and remanded to the fcc for further deliberation 
in  the united states supreme court declined to hear an appeal of the court of appeals decision 
in june  the fcc adopted a further rule making proceeding to reexamine the ownership rules in light of the court decision 
in december  the fcc brought this proceeding to a close by making only moderate changes to the newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule and leaving the other rules unchanged 
in  congress by statute fixed the limit on nationwide ownership of television broadcast stations at of all us households and the fcc has conformed its rules to that statute 
we are unable to predict the timing or outcome of any fcc deliberations 
should the fcc s amended rules ultimately become effective  attractive opportunities may arise for additional television station and other media acquisitions 
but these changes also create additional competition for us from other entities  such as national broadcast networks  large station groups  newspaper chains and cable operators who may be better positioned to take advantage of such changes and benefit from the resulting operating synergies both nationally and in specific markets 
should the television duopoly rule become relaxed  we may be able to acquire the ownership of one or both of the stations in austin and providence for which we currently provide programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements and for which we have purchase option agreements to purchase these stations 
should we be unable to do so  there is no assurance that the grandfathering of our local marketing agreements will be permitted beyond conclusion of the current further rule making 
we had net revenues of million  or  of our total net revenues  attributable to local marketing agreements for the year ended december  any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations 
if the united states becomes engaged in new  large scale foreign hostilities or if there is a terrorist attack against the us  we may lose advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting expenses due to pre emption  delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and increased costs of providing news coverage of such events 
we cannot predict the extent and duration of any future disruption to our programming schedule  the amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or the amount by which our expenses would increase as a result 
consequently  any related future loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 

table of contents item properties we maintain our corporate headquarters in providence under an operating lease that expires on december  each of our stations has facilities consisting of offices  studios  sales offices and tower and transmitter sites 
tower and transmitter sites are located in areas that provide optimal coverage to each of our markets 
we own substantially all of the offices and studios where our stations are located and generally own the property where our towers and primary transmitters are located 
we lease the remaining properties  consisting primarily of sales office locations and microwave transmitter sites 
while none of the station properties owned or leased by us are individually material to our operations  if we were required to relocate any of our towers  the cost could be significant 
this is because the number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to provide good coverage of the market is limited  and zoning and other land use restrictions  as well as federal aviation administration and fcc regulations  limit the number of alternative locations or increase the cost of acquiring them for tower sites 
item legal proceedings we are involved in various claims and lawsuits that are generally incidental to our business 
we are vigorously contesting all of these matters and believe that their ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on us 
in november  we assigned our option to acquire the outstanding shares of the entity holding the fcc license of knva tv to a third party  vaughan media  llc vaughan media  as permitted by the terms of the option 
we program knva tv pursuant to a local marketing agreement with the entity holding knva tv s fcc license 
vaughan media subsequently exercised the option to acquire the shares of the licensee 
in response  on december   the licensee  broadcasting  inc  filed a complaint against us and vaughan media in the rd judicial district court of travis county  austin  texas alleging that our assignment and the subsequent option exercise were not valid 
the action was subsequently removed to the united states district court  western district of texas  austin division 
we believe these claims are without merit and are vigorously defending the action

critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements certain of our accounting policies  as well as estimates we make  are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations since they are particularly sensitive to our judgment 
some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the estimates and judgments we make affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  program rights  income taxes  stock based compensation  pensions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and it is possible that such differences could have a material 
table of contents impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are particularly critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have discussed each of these critical accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets approximately billion  or  of our total assets as of december  consisted of unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
as required by sfas  we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario that excludes network compensation payments 
also as required by sfas  we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess but not more than the carrying value of goodwill 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the second quarter of that included a broadcast license impairment charge of million relating to of our television stations and a goodwill impairment charge of million 
as required by sfas  we tested our unamortized intangible assets as of june   which was between annual tests  because we believed that  based upon the continued decline in the trading price of our class a common stock and the departure of our former chief executive officer  it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units would fall below their carrying amounts 
we used market information not available as of december  to calculate the fair value of our broadcast licenses and reporting units 
the impairment tests as of june  used the same assumptions as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   except that the discount rate used in determining the fair value was adjusted from to  market growth ranged from to  and the operating profit margins ranged from to 
there were no events during to warrant the performance of an interim impairment test of our unamortized intangible assets 
as required by sfas  we have performed our annual test for impairment of broadcast licenses and goodwill as of december   and as a result of these annual tests no impairment was recorded as of december  and and an impairment of million was recorded for the year ended december  the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions 

table of contents we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on the following basic assumptions for the years ended december market revenue growth to to operating profit margins to to discount rate tax rate to to capitalization rate to to regarding potential changes to these assumptions and the potential impact on the december  carrying values of our broadcast licenses  if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by and by  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
we based the valuation of goodwill on the following basic assumptions for the years ended december market revenue growth to to operating profit margins to to discount rate tax rate to to capitalization rate to to regarding potential changes to these assumptions and the potential impact on the december  carrying value of our goodwill  if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by and by  the fair value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  the fair value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  the fair value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
in addition  we would then be required to take these fair values to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill million at december  
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by a notional reperformance of the purchase price allocation using the station s fair value as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
network affiliations other broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets by these broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local 
table of contents television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market  the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s  generally channels two to thirteen  are viewed more often than newer television stations  vhf stations  generally channels two to thirteen are typically viewed more often than uhf stations generally channels fourteen to sixty nine because these stations have been broadcasting longer than uhf stations and because of the inferior uhf signal in the early years of uhf stations  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station 
the local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming  and the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the top rated station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  cbs  fox and nbc  each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest primetime audience in the local market in which the station operates regardless of the network s primetime rating 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 

table of contents if we were to assign higher values to our acquired network affiliation agreements and  therefore  less value to our broadcast licenses  it would have a significant impact on our operating results 
the following chart reflects the hypothetical impact of the reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliations and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a year amortization period for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share data percentage of total value reassigned to network affiliation agreements as reported balance sheet as of december  broadcast licenses other intangible assets  net including network affiliation agreements statement of operations for the year ended december  amortization of intangible assets operating income income loss from continuing operations net income net income per diluted share we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to our television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all our markets in which we operate beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different facts and circumstances for each station and market being evaluated 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
revenue recognition we recognize advertising and other program related revenue during the period in which advertising or programs are aired on our television stations or carried by our internet websites 
we recognize retransmission consent fees in the period in which these services are performed 

table of contents stock based compensation on october   we adopted sfas r  share based payment sfas r and its related implementation guidance in accounting for stock based employee compensation arrangements 
this statement requires us to estimate the fair value of stock based awards exchanged for employee services and recognize compensation cost based on this fair value over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables to be assumed in the calculation  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
price volatility is based on historical trends for our class a common stock and the common stock of peer group companies engaged in the broadcasting business 
expected forfeitures are estimated using our historical experience 
if future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  our future stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the following table presents the stock based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of income and recognized in accordance with sfas r for the years ended december  and  and the three month period ended december  the table also presents the stock based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of income and recognized in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb for the nine month period ended september  in thousands based on the accounting rules under sfas r apb three months ended nine months year ended december  december  ended september  direct operating selling  general and administrative corporate share based compensation expense before tax income tax benefit net stock based compensation expense we expect stock based compensation expense to increase over the next two years due to continued vesting of existing option and stock awards 
we have not yet recognized compensation expense relating to these unvested employee stock options and stock awards of million in the aggregate  which will be recognized over a weighted average future period of approximately to years 
prior to october   we accounted for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by apb and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant in these periods 
we adopted the provisions of sfas through financial footnote disclosure only 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect on net income loss if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation in this period in thousands  except per share data nine months ended september  net income  as reported add stock based employee compensation expense  included in reported net income  net of tax effect deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards  net of tax effect net income  pro forma basic and diluted net income per common share  as reported basic and diluted net income per common share  pro forma the fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for the nine months ended september  nine months ended september  volatility risk free interest rates weighted average expected life years dividend yields retirement plan we have a defined benefit retirement plan covering certain of our employees 
our pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts in accordance with sfas employer s accounting for pensions sfas 
we adopted sfas employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements   and r sfas and recorded the unfunded status of our plan as of december  the plan assets and benefit obligations of our defined benefit plan are recorded at fair value as of december  we provide a defined benefit retirement plan to our employees who do not receive matching contributions from our company to their k plan accounts 
our defined benefit plan is a non contributory plan under which we make contributions either to a traditional plan participants based on periodic actuarial valuations  which are expensed over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees  or b cash balance plan participants based on of each participant s eligible compensation 
we contributed million  million and million to our pension plan for years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plan in although we currently have no minimum funding requirements as defined by erisa and federal tax laws 

table of contents pension plan assumptions weighted average assumptions used to estimate our pension benefit obligation and to determine our net periodic pension benefit cost  and the actual long term rate of return on plan assets year ended december  discount rate used to estimate our pension benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic pension benefit rate of compensation increase expected long term rate of return plan assets actual long term rate of return on plan assets we used the citigroup pension discount curve as our discount rate  which we believe reflects the weighted rate of a theoretical high quality bond portfolio consistent with the duration of our pension liability 
we considered the current levels of expected returns on a risk free investment  the historical levels of risk premium associated with each of our pension asset classes  the expected future returns for each of our pension asset classes and then weighted each asset class based on our pension plan asset allocation to derive an expected long term return on pension plan assets 
our pension expense is expected to be approximately million for for every change in the actual return compared to the expected long term return on pension plan assets  our pension expense will change by approximately million 
for every change in the actual discount rate compared to the discount rate assumption for  our pension expense will change by approximately million 
our investment objective is to achieve a consistent total rate of return that will equal or exceed our actuarial assumptions and to equal or exceed the benchmarks that we use for each of our pension plan asset classes including the s p index  s p mid cap index  russell index  msci eafe index and the lehman brothers aggregate bond index

sfas r is effective prospectively for all business 
table of contents combinations or other defined transactions occurring on or after january  and early adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect sfas r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and we plan to adopt it effective january  in december  the fasb issued sfas non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which amends accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements arb 
sfas is effective for quarterly and annual reporting periods that begin after december  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards with respect to non controlling interests also called minority interests in an effort to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of financial information that a company provides with respect to its non controlling interests 
the significant requirements under sfas are the reporting of the non controlling interests separately in the equity section of the balance sheet and the reporting of the net income or loss of the controlling and non controlling interests separately on the face of the statement of operations 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and we plan to adopt it effective january  in february  the fasb issued sfas the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas sfas  which is effective the first fiscal year that begins after november  sfas permits companies to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to reduce volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we are not adopting sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
on november   the fasb authorized its staff to draft a proposed fasb staff position that would partially defer the effective date of sfas for one year for non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
notwithstanding the potential effective date deferral discussed above  the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of will have a material impact on our financial statements
