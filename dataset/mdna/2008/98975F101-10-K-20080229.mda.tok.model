industry background until the mid s  video images and audio soundtracks were transmitted  edited and stored almost exclusively using analog formats 
since then  advances in technology have allowed audio and video to be processed and stored in digital form 
unlike analog formats  which are inherently unstable and difficult to edit and enhance  digital formats permit the manipulation of audio and video signals through digital signal processing and offer a number of fundamental advantages over analog technologies 
through complex digital signal processing operations  digital audio and video signals may be compressed  providing significant storage and transmission efficiencies 
they also may be filtered  allowing for noise reduction  and they may be transmitted and reproduced without perceptible image or sound degradation 
digital formats provide users with additional benefits  including higher quality audio and video  random access to data and superior editing capabilities 
enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying and controlled and secure access also encourages content owners to release their content in digital forms 
one of the most significant barriers to the widespread adoption of digital technology had been the huge amount of data required to represent images and sounds in a digital format  making cost effective storage or transmission impractical 
through digital compression techniques  a substantial number of the redundancies inherent in audio and video data can be identified and eliminated  significantly reducing the overall amount of data which needs to be retained 
compression techniques introduced in the early s allowed a two hour movie to be compressed and stored on only two video cds with video resolution comparable to that of a standard vhs tape 
more recent techniques allow the storage of a full length movie of more than three hours on a single dvd  with substantially improved audio and video quality and the incorporation of additional data  such as additional languages  scenes and director and actor commentary 
even more recently  further advancements in compression technology now allow  for example  a complete high definition movie to be stored in even less space 
additionally  digital compression of video data allows previously unmanageable amounts of data to be stored in the memory of a disk drive  thereby permitting the data to be accessed and edited easily 
it also allows for easier transmission of sharper resolution pictures through a standard definition or high definition television or set top box 
digital audio compression allows efficient storage and delivery of multi channel audio  making possible high quality special effects such as multi channel surround sound  virtual surround sound and wireless audio delivery via two speakers or headphones 
in the field of still photography  digital compression allows hundreds or even thousands of digital pictures to be stored on a single memory card  depending on the resolution desired 
to drive the implementation and speed the adoption of products based on digital formats  industry participants organized committees to define international compression standards 
the principal standards in use today include the following the joint photographic experts group  or jpeg  standard for the high quality compression of still images and the real time  low cost compression and decompression of moving images  the mpeg standard  adopted by the moving pictures experts group  or mpeg  for the compression of both audio and video data at the high compression ratios necessary for the limited storage capacity of the cd rom format  the mpeg standard  subsequently adopted by the motion pictures experts group  for the compression of both audio and video data  designed to provide improved quality in broadcast and video playback applications  the mpeg standard  which is an extension of mpeg and mpeg that provides the ability to view  access and manipulate objects rather than pixels  which is especially significant in video streaming  digital television  mobile multimedia and video game applications 
mpeg part standard  also known as advanced video codec avc or h  is an addition to the mpeg standard  offering significantly improved compression efficiencies  xvid  divx and mp file formats  which are based on the mpeg standard  are used encoding high quality digital video and audio at low bit rates 
these files can be viewed on the pc with a software player  on select dvd players and portable media  windows media  microsoft s standard digital media software platform for developing digital media products and services  and dolby digital  developed by dolby laboratories  an industry standard for the compression of audio for use in multi channel digital surround sound systems 
these industry standard techniques have enabled the dramatic growth in the following digital multimedia markets dvd players and recorders dvd players and recorders primarily use mpeg video compression and dolby digital audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback or recording than is possible with vcr or video cd technology 
according to industry analysts  sales of red laser dvd players are estimated to be over million units in and are expected to increase slightly in  while high definition dvd players are expected to become a major growth market  increasing from million units in to over million units in standard definition and high definition televisions and set top boxes digital televisions receive digital content and process it to display a picture which has far greater resolution and sharper  more clearly defined images than televisions based on the older analog technology 
standard definition televisions generally contain lines with pixels per line 
high definition television  or hdtv  television sets contain to pixels per line and up to lines 
the aspect ratio of standard definition sets is  compared to for hdtv 
the lines may be displayed using different techniques  often referred to as interlacing or alternatively progressive scan 
the capability to receive and process digital television signals can be contained in a set top box  which then drives a television that is capable of displaying digital content 
alternatively  this functionality can be integrated into a digital television that does not require a set top box 
digital content is broadcast via satellite  cable networks or over the air terrestrial broadcast in various markets throughout the world 
industry analysts estimate that over million digital televisions and million set top boxes were shipped worldwide in and that over million digital televisions and million set top box products will be shipped in mobile products digital cameras use jpeg compression technology to capture high resolution still images that can be viewed  edited and stored on a computer system  on a recordable dvd  and or transmitted over telephone lines and computer networks 
some digital cameras are capable of capturing and playing back quality video  using the mpeg algorithm 
according to idc  sales of digital cameras exceeded million units in and are expected to exceed million units during according to techno systems research  the market for higher quality camera phones with at least megapixel resolution is expected to grow from million units in to more than million units in products and markets are developed based on established compression standards and additional compression technologies such as meridian lossless pcm  or mlp  a new standard for dvd audio  super audio  or sacd  microsoft windows media audio  or wma  advanced audio codec aac used in conjunction with the mpeg video standard and mp  a compression standard for the download of audio recordings from the internet 
these established and emerging compression standards specify data formats which enable products from different vendors to interact and permit the capture  transmission  storage and display of audio and video data in digital format 
these standards do not specify the compression methodologies to be employed or additional functionality that may be used to enhance or manipulate digital signals 
these standards  therefore  do not determine image or sound quality or compression efficiency 
for example  data compression may comply with relevant standards despite being poorly processed and containing artifacts that result in image degradation in video applications or poor sound quality in audio applications 
as a result  there can be significant differences in overall image or sound quality between two solutions based on the same standard 
therefore  integrated circuit manufacturers can differentiate their products on the basis of the quality of their compression solution 
historically  as system vendors sought compression solutions  the cost  complexity and time required to compress and decompress data imposed significant limitations on the use of digital compression 
over the last several years  as cost effective compression solutions have emerged  product manufacturers have increasingly sought to design and market lower cost digital audio and video systems and products to address an increasing number of high volume consumer applications 
in addition  product manufacturers are facing competitive pressure to introduce their products more rapidly 
to address these issues  oems continually seek to integrate more and more functions on individual chips in order to reduce their costs  time to market and power consumption 
they also seek solutions that can easily be integrated into their commercial and consumer products 
the challenge to manufacturers of compression integrated circuits is  therefore  to provide product manufacturers with high quality  cost effective  standards based solutions that enable flexible control  image enhancement  audio effects and other functions in addition to high quality compression solutions

markets and applications our products are currently used in a variety of consumer multimedia applications  including the following consumer video playback systems dvd players primarily use mpeg video compression and dolby digital or similar audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback than is possible with earlier generation products such as vcrs  video cd or super video cd players 
dvd players are sold as stand alone products and are also bundled with other functions including dvd vcrs  dvd receivers and dvd tv combinations 
in addition  the dvd player can act as a platform for playback and editing of digital still images from digital cameras through integrated memory card slots or via direct connection to digital cameras 
digital television the digital television market represents the most significant technological shift in the consumer electronics market since color televisions were introduced in the late s 
today  digital content providers broadcast programming via satellite  cable or terrestrial over the air networks 
the mix of broadcast networks varies by geographic region 
for example  most digital television content in japan and korea is broadcast via terrestrial networks  while cable networks currently predominate in the united states 
satellite networks offer an alternative source of content to consumers and are continuing to grow in various regions 
each geographic market is subject to regulations that require compliance with different governmental standards applicable to broadcast technology and content format 
in each region  individual broadcasters also have developed their own proprietary standards for content  security and conditional access 
this market requires television products  set top boxes  personal video recorders and other digital consumer appliances to include sophisticated integrated circuits and embedded software that address the emerging requirements of multiple broadcast networks throughout the world 
the requirement by the us federal communications commission  or fcc  that all new televisions contain a built in digital receiver  has accelerated the growth of the digital television market in the us we expect this growth to continue over the next several years 
mobile products digital cameras enable the capture of high resolution images  the viewing  editing and storage of images on a computer system and their transmission over telephone lines and computer networks

backlog sales of our products are made pursuant to firm purchase orders 
however  sometimes we allow customers to cancel or reschedule deliveries 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of products ordered as a result of changes in customers requirements and manufacturing availability 
our ability to order products can carry lead times of between four and sixteen weeks  however  most of our business is characterized by short lead times and quick delivery schedules 
as a result of these factors  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future sales 
manufacturing we contract our wafer fabrication  assembly and testing to independent foundries and contractors  which enables us to focus on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
our engineers work closely with our foundry partners and subcontractors to increase yields  lower manufacturing costs and assure quality 
our primary foundry is taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  which has manufactured integrated circuits for us since tsmc and tower semiconductor ltd 
are currently manufacturing our dvd  jpeg  dtv imaging and some of our mobile products 
lsi corporation is providing turn key manufacturing for one high end laser printer product 
our independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
our primary services company for assembly and testing is advance semiconductor engineering inc most of our devices are currently fabricated using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology with micron to micron feature sizes 
most of our semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of four independent contractors and tested by those contractors or other independent contractors 
we currently purchase products from all of our foundries under individually negotiated purchase orders 
we do not currently have a long term supply contract with tsmc  and therefore tsmc is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
competition our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater finance  manufacturing  technology  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
some of these competitors also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
our principal competitors in the integrated audio and video devices for dvd applications include cheertek  ess technology inc  lsi corporation  magnum semiconductor  matsushita  mediatek  renesas technology  samsung and sunplus 
in the markets for jpeg based products for use in digital cameras  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  as well as products sold by fujitsu  mediatek  novatech  sunplus and texas instruments 
in the market for jpeg based products for desktop video editing applications  our principal competitor is sunplus 
cirrus logic crystal semiconductor  freescale semiconductor  fujitsu  stmicroelectronics and yamaha are currently shipping dolby digital based audio compression products 
our principal competitors for digital semiconductor devices in the digital television market include applied micro devices  broadcom  m star  mediatek  renesas technology and st microelectronics 
others who also participate in this market are ali corporation  cheertek  fujitsu  nec  pixelworks and trident microsystems 
competitors in the printer and multifunction peripheral space include global graphics  marvell semiconductor  peerless systems  sigmatel inc and in house captive suppliers 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for high performance audio  video and imaging technology depends on a number of factors  including the following quality  performance  price and features of our products  the timing and success of new product introductions by zoran  our customers and our competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
we believe that growth of the dvd player market will be modest in the foreseeable future  and that continued strong competition will lead to further price reductions  and reduced profit margins 
historically  average unit selling prices asps in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
we expect that the asps of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures 
in order to offset expected declines in the asps of our products  we seek to continually reduce the cost of our products and continue to integrate additional functions into our ics 
we intend to accomplish this by implementing design changes that integrate additional functionality  lower the cost of manufacturing  assembly and testing  by negotiating reduced charges by our foundries as  and if  volumes increase  and by successfully managing our manufacturing and subcontracting relationships 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities 
if we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships  our business would be harmed 
proprietary rights and licenses our ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information 
although we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect some of our intellectual property  we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  resellers  customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information 
we currently hold issued patents worldwide  and have additional patent applications pending 
our intellectual property rights  if challenged  may not be upheld as valid  may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future 
in particular  the existence of several consortiums that license patents relating to the mpeg standard has created uncertainty with respect to the use and enforceability of patents implementing that standard 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and  thus  make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we or our foundries from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we have been subject to intellectual property claims and litigation in the past 
see item legal proceedings 
we may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future 
in particular  given the uncertainty discussed above regarding patents relating to the mpeg standard  it is difficult for us to assess the possibility that our activities in the mpeg field may give rise to future patent infringement claims 
litigation by or against us relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
licenses may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology that it uses  we could incur substantial liabilities and be forced to suspend the manufacture of products  or the use by our foundries of certain processes 
we sell our dolby technology enabled products under a perpetual  non exclusive license from dolby to sell products that incorporate the dolby digital algorithm 
we are not required to pay license fees or royalties to dolby under this agreement 
our customers enter into license agreements directly with dolby  pursuant to which they pay royalties to dolby 
under our agreement with dolby  we may sell our dolby digital based products only to customers who are licensees of dolby 
to date  most potential customers for our dolby digital based products are licensees of dolby 
however  the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could harm our sales 
we have non exclusive licenses from various third parties to sell our third party enabled products that incorporate the respective technologies 
we are not required to pay royalties under the agreements 
under our agreements  we may sell such third party enabled products only to customers who are licensees of such third parties 
we rely on our customers to enter into license agreements directly with the third parties pursuant to which they pay royalties and or license fees 
the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreement with such third parties in the future could harm our sales

item a risk factors our future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
the independent investigation of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements and derivative lawsuits has been time consuming and expensive  and has had an adverse effect on our financial performance 
the independent investigation of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatement activities and derivative lawsuits have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting  legal and other expenses totaling million in and million in the resulting restatements have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have recorded additional stock based compensation expense of million for stock option grants  recognized over the periods from to there was no tax impact of these additional stock based compensation expenses due to the full valuation allowance on our tax assets at the time of restatement 
in addition  we have recorded other adjustments previously considered to be immaterial totaling million net of tax of million 
as a result  our restated consolidated financial statements reflect a decrease in net income of million for the period of to ongoing government inquiries relating to our historical stock option practices are time consuming and expensive and could result in injunctions  fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the inquiry by the united states attorney s office for the northern district of california usao into our historical stock option practices is ongoing 
we have cooperated with the usao and intend to continue to do so 
the period of time necessary to resolve this inquiry is uncertain  and we cannot predict the outcome of the inquiry or whether we will face additional government inquiries  investigations or other actions related to our historical stock option practices 
this inquiry may require us to continue to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses  and could result in criminal actions against the company which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
during parts of and  we were not timely in the filing of our periodic reports with the sec  which led nasdaq to warn us of a possible de listing of our common stock 
should we have similar issues in the future  our listing on nasdaq  and the availability of a liquid market for resale of your shares  could be at risk 
from august to april  we were unable to file our periodic reports with the sec on time and faced the possibility of delisting of our stock from the nasdaq global select market 
as a result of our delay in filing periodic reports on a timely basis  we will not be eligible to use a registration statement on form s to register offers and sales of our securities until all periodic reports have been timely filed for at least months 
if in the future we have similar issues filing periodic reports and fail to comply with applicable listing requirements  then our common stock may be de listed and the market for resales of our common stock may become less liquid 
if this happens  the price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  we would be subject to restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws  and we would not be able to issue stock options or other equity awards to our employees or allow them to exercise their outstanding options  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have been named as a party to stockholder derivative lawsuits relating to our historical stock option practices  and we may be named in additional lawsuits in the future 
this litigation has become time consuming and expensive and may result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements  a number of purported shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors  officers and certain other individuals  which purport to assert claims on our behalf 
there may be additional lawsuits of this nature filed in the future 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits  nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits 
if these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive  or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our insurance coverage will not cover our total liabilities and expenses in these lawsuits  in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage 
in addition  we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related government inquiries and litigation 
we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers  although our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters 
furthermore  the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters  in which case we may have to self fund all or a substantial portion of our indemnification obligations 
failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the sec  affect our nasdaq listing  and adversely affect our stock price 
we are required to include a report from management on internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the restatement of financial statements in prior filings with the sec is a strong indicator of the existence of a material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting 
however  management concluded that the control deficiencies that resulted in the restatement of the previously issued consolidated financial statements did not constitute a material weakness as of december  in addition  management determined that as of december  there continued to be effective controls designed and in place to prevent or detect a material misstatement 
the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors  and there is a risk that its inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec  or otherwise take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  the sec may issue guidance or disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors that may require us to amend this filing or prior filings with the sec to provide additional disclosures pursuant to this guidance 
any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent sec reports and delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
it may be difficult or costly to obtain director and officer liability insurance coverage as a result of our stock options issues 
we expect that the issues arising from our historical stock option grant practices and the related accounting will make it more difficult to obtain director and officer insurance coverage in the future 
if we are able to obtain this coverage  it could be significantly more costly than in the past  which would have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow 
as a result of this and related factors  our directors and officers could face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified directors and officers  which could adversely affect our business 
our annual revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the prices of our common stock 
our historical operating results have varied significantly from period to period due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for our products  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and our customers products  the timing or cancellation of large customer orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  pricing policy changes by us and by our competitors and suppliers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  seasonality in demand for our products  increased competition in product lines  and competitive pricing pressures  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our integrated circuits and embedded software 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in or the emergence of new industry standards  failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  the loss or gain of important customers  product obsolescence  and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
our operating results could also be harmed by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business including recent events in the subprime mortgage market  terrorism and international conflicts or other crises  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  changes in governmental regulations that could affect our products  a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the consumer electronics market  disruption in commercial activities associated with heightened security concerns affecting international travel and commerce  reduced demand for consumer electronic products due to a potential economic slowdown  tightened immigration controls that may adversely affect the residence status of key non us managers and technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities  or potential expansion of armed conflict in the middle east which could adversely affect our operations in israel 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast 
we place orders with independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from our customers 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for their products 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  or if we fail to foresee a technology change that could render a product obsolete  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
if anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled or do not occur  gross margins may be reduced 
a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on our forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet our expectations  we may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could harm our operating results 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes their sales to fluctuate 
because the markets that our customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventories of our products 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if the products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related mature product 
our customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the second half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday shopping period for consumer electronics products  and therefore  a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
we expect these seasonal sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our ability to match production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter s revenue forecast 
in addition  when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times  we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands 
these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions 
if we inaccurately forecast customer demand  we may hold inadequate  excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods  if we are unable to reduce our costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results will suffer 
average selling prices for our products decline over relatively short time periods  while many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we are able to sell more units  and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we have experienced these problems  and we expect to continue to experience them in the future  although we cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they will be 
product supply and demand in the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
in some cases  these downturns have lasted more than one year 
the recent emergence of a number of negative economic factors  including heightened fears of a recession  could lead to such a downturn 
we cannot predict whether we will achieve timely  cost effective access to that capacity when needed  or when there will be a capacity shortage again in the future 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry could harm our sales and revenues if demand drops  or our gross margins if average selling prices decline 
our success for the foreseeable future will depend on demand for integrated circuits for a limited number of applications 
in recent years  we have derived a substantial majority of our product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for dvd and digital camera applications 
we expect that sales of our products for these applications will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will also depend on our ability to successfully develop and market new products in the digital television  hdtv and digital imaging markets 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
our financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new and enhanced products 
our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to successfully develop and market next generation and new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 
if we fail to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance  we may lose our market share and our future revenues and earnings may suffer 
in the consumer electronic market  our performance has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for dvd players  digital cameras  broadband digital television and hdtv 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and numbers of features on a chip at the same or lower system cost  enabling original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to continually improve the features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to continually develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
in the imaging market  our performance has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for printers and multi function peripherals 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and higher speeds on a chip at the same or lower system cost  enabling oems to improve the performance and features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration  performance and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
the performance of our software licensing business is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new releases of our software  which incorporate new or enhanced printing standards  as well as performance enhancements required by our oem customers 
if we are unable to develop and release versions of our software supporting required standards and offering enhanced performance  our operating results will suffer 
we face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  when customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
because of short product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technological  market  distribution and other resources 
these competitors may also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers and suppliers than we have 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
our principal competitors in the integrated audio and video devices for dvd applications include cheertek  ess technology inc  lsi corporation  magnum semiconductor  matsushita  mediatek  renesas technology  samsung and sunplus 
in the markets for jpeg based products for use in digital cameras  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  as well as products sold by fujitsu  mediatek  novatech  sunplus and texas instruments 
in the market for jpeg based products for desktop video editing applications  our principal competitor is sunplus 
cirrus logic crystal semiconductor  freescale semiconductor  fujitsu  stmicroelectronics and yamaha are currently shipping dolby digital based audio compression products 
our principal competitors for digital semiconductor devices in the digital television market include applied micro devices  broadcom  m star  mediatek  renesas technology and st microelectronics 
others who also participate in this market are ali corporation  cheertek  fujitsu  nec  pixelworks and trident microsystems 
competitors in the printer and multifunction peripheral space include global graphics  marvell semiconductor  peerless systems  sigmatel inc and in house captive suppliers 
we believe that growth of the dvd player market will be modest in the foreseeable future  and that continued strong competition will lead to further price reductions  and reduced profit margins 
we also face significant competition in the digital imaging and digital camera markets 
the future growth of both markets is highly dependent on oems continuing to outsource an increasing portion of their product development work 
many of our existing competitors  as well as oem customers that are expected to compete with us in the future  have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
in addition  much of our future success is dependent on the success of our oem customers 
if we or our oem customers are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  we could experience price reductions  order cancellations and reduced gross margins  any one of which could harm our business 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
the consumer electronics market  in particular  is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or the products of our customers could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share or be required to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our success will also depend on the successful development of new markets and the application and acceptance of new technologies and products in those new markets 
for example  our success will depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products in the recordable dvd player market and products for the broadband digital television and hdtv markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
these markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we currently anticipate due to factors outside our control  such as delays in implementation of fcc requiring all new televisions to include a digital receiver by february if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
the emergence of new markets for our products is also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products 
if this content is not available  manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating our products  and our sales would suffer 
we rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuits and other hardware products  and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we do not operate any manufacturing facilities  and we rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our products 
these independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
from time to time  there are manufacturing capacity shortages in the semiconductor industry 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers  including our principal supplier taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  and our principal assembly house 
therefore  tsmc and our other suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  the unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of our products  lack of control over delivery schedules  lack of control over quality assurance  lack of control over manufacturing yields and cost  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  tsmc and some of our other foundries are located in areas of the world that are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
while the earthquake in taiwan did not have a material impact on our independent foundries  a similar event centered near tsmc s facility could severely reduce tsmc s ability to manufacture our integrated circuits 
the loss of any of our manufacturers as a supplier  our inability to expand the supply of their products in response to increased demand  or our inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of our products 
any of these circumstances could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we also rely on a limited number of independent contractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits our control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the services provided by our assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require them to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of our products 
these constraints or delays could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our financial results 
because foundry capacity is limited from time to time  we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have considered  and may in the future need to consider  various arrangements with suppliers  which could include  among others option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  joint ventures  or other partnership relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
if our independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in photo masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non functional 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
as a result  foundries often experience problems achieving acceptable yields  which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular wafer 
poor yields from our independent foundries would reduce our ability to deliver our products to customers  harm our relationships with our customers and harm our business 
we are dependent upon our international sales and operations  economic  political or military events in a country where we make significant sales or have significant operations could interfere with our success or operations there and harm our business 
during  only of our total revenues were derived from north america sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  substantially all of our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 
we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic instability  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and health risks in a particular region 
a material amount of our research and development personnel and facilities and a portion of our sales and marketing personnel are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually 
the absence of these employees for significant periods during the work week may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods 
our operations in china are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country 
for example  the chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors 
this growth may decrease and any slowdown may have a negative effect on our business 
we also maintain offices in canada  england  germany  hong kong  india  israel  japan  korea and taiwan  and our operations are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting these countries as well 
the significant concentration of our manufacturing activities with third party foundries in taiwan exposes us to the risk of political instability in taiwan  including the potential for conflict between taiwan and china 
we have several significant oem customers in japan  korea and other parts of asia 
adverse economic circumstances in asia could affect these customers willingness or ability to do business with us in the future or their success in developing and launching devices containing our products 
the prices of our products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of our products 
prices for our products are currently denominated in us dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency  our products may be less competitive in that country and our revenues may be adversely affected 
also  we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
because we have significant operations in israel  our business and future operating results could be harmed by future terrorist activity or military conflict 
we conduct a significant portion of our research and development and engineering activities at our design center in haifa  israel  a  square foot facility where we employ approximately people 
we also conduct a portion of our sales and marketing operations at our haifa facility 
we have an additional  square foot facility in kfar netter  israel  where we conduct research and development activities 
in addition  military conflict in the middle east or future terrorist activities there or elsewhere in the world could harm our business as a result of a disruption in commercial activity affecting international commerce or a general economic slowdown and reduced demand for consumer electronic products 
the israeli rate of inflation may negatively impact our costs if it exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the united states dollar 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in israel or the decline in the value of united states dollar compared to the new israeli shekel will increase our costs as expressed in united states dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against the new israeli shekel 
these measures may not adequately protect us from the impact of inflation in israel 
we derive most of our revenue from sales to a small number of large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
our largest customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of our revenues 
in  one customer accounted for of our total revenues  while sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
in  one customer accounted for of our total revenues  and sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to retain our key customers  or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers could harm our sales and financial results 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial results 
as of december  three customers accounted for approximately  and of the net accounts receivable balance  respectively 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increases our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into larger systems 
as a result  our sales processes are often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
customers generally purchase our products subject to cancelable short term purchase orders 
we cannot predict whether our current customers will continue to place orders  whether existing orders will be canceled  or whether customers who have ordered products will pay invoices for delivered products 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
early termination by one of our major customers would harm our financial results 
our products could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to customers or could damage market acceptance of such products 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
regulation of our customers products may slow the process of introducing new products and could impair our ability to compete 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over our target markets in the digital television business 
various international entities or organizations may also regulate aspects of our business or the business of our customers 
although our products are not directly subject to regulation by any agency  the transmission pipes  as well as much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated  are subject to direct government regulation 
for example  before they can be sold in the united states  advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays must be tested and certified by underwriters laboratories and meet fcc regulations 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which our customers operate may in turn harm our business 
fcc regulatory policies affecting the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services and other terms on which these companies conduct their business may impede sales of our products 
in addition  our digital television business may also be adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on our suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations in the united states or elsewhere could harm our business 
for example  any delays by the fcc in imposing its pending requirement that all new televisions have a digital receiver could have an adverse effect on our hdtv business 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protection of our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
the protection offered by patents is subject to numerous uncertainties 
for example  our competitors may be able to effectively design around our patents  or the patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
those competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  while we hold  or have applied for  patents relating to the design of our products  some of our products are based in part on standards  for which we do not hold patents or other intellectual property rights 
we have generally limited access to and distribution of the source and object code of our software and other proprietary information 
with respect to our page description language software  system on a chip platform firmware and drivers for the digital office market and in limited circumstances with respect to firmware and platforms for our dtv  dvdr products  we grant licenses that give our customers access to and restricted use of the source code of our software 
this access increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of our technology 
claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights and breach of contract claims could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties intellectual property rights  and we have been parties to a number of patent related lawsuits  both as plaintiff and defendant 
we could become subject to additional litigation in the future  either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of allegations that we infringe others intellectual property rights or have breached our contractual obligations to others 
claims that our products infringe proprietary rights or that we have breached contractual obligations would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement or breach 
future litigation against us  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  are time consuming and expensive to resolve and require significant management time and attention 
future intellectual property and breach of contract litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use such technology 
although patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements  we may not be able in any or every instance to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we have a more limited patent portfolio than many of our competitors 
if a successful claim is made against us or any of our customers and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we are required to pay substantial damages or awards  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our products could become obsolete 
from time to time  we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements  we may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
we rely on licenses to use various technologies that are material to our products 
we do not own the patents that underlie this license 
our rights to use these technologies and employ the inventions claimed in the licensed patents are subject to our abiding by the terms of the licenses 
under the license agreements we must fulfill confidentiality obligations and pay royalties 
if we fail to abide by the terms of the license  we would be unable to sell and market the products under license 
in addition  we do not control the prosecution of the patents subject to this license or the strategy for determining when such patents should be enforced 
as a result  we are dependent upon our licensor to determine the appropriate strategy for prosecuting and enforcing those patents 
if we are not able to apply our net operating losses against taxable income in future periods  our financial results will be harmed 
our future net income and cash flow will be affected by our ability to apply our net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  against taxable income in future periods 
our nols totaled approximately million for federal and million for state tax reporting purposes as of december  the internal revenue code contains a number of provisions that limit the use of nols under certain circumstances 
in  we reduced the nol deferred tax asset for amounts which we believe will expire before they become available for utilization 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize these nols 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize these respective nols could harm our financial condition 
changes in  or interpretations of  tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws  by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
while we believe our tax reserves adequately provide for any tax contingencies  the ultimate outcomes of any future tax audits are uncertain  and we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
any additional acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
we have made investments in  and acquisitions of other complementary companies  products and technologies  and we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute its current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  use a significant amount of our cash  assume liabilities  incur expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  or incur other large write offs immediately or in the future 
our operation of any other acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of the business  products or technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition 
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  future cash flows  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on our results of operations 
if we fail to manage our future growth  if any  our business would be harmed 
we anticipate that our future growth  if any  will require us to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
our ability to manage growth successfully will also require us to expand and improve administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of our key operations  including a material portion of our research and development operations and a significant portion of our sales and administrative operations are located in israel 
a majority of our sales and marketing and certain of our research and development and administrative personnel  including our president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on our resources and our ability to manage growth effectively 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate securities and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
the company s investments at december  include million of high grade auction rate securities primarily consisting of government guaranteed student loans 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rates which periodically reset through auctions  typically within every days 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
during february  some of the auction rate securities failed to auction successfully due to market supply exceeding market demand 
in the event of a failed auction  the notes continue to bear interest at a predetermined maximum rate based on the credit rating of notes as determined by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers redeem the securities or the underlying securities have matured 
as a result  the company has classified all auction rate securities as long term assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments and auction rate securities is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
recent events in the subprime mortgage market and with auction rate securities could negatively impact our return on investment for these debt securities and thereby reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalents and long term investments on our balance sheet 
we rely on the services of our executive officers and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our senior management 
management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  located in the united states and overseas 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract  integrate and retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of zoran 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these include provisions prohibiting a merger with a party that has acquired control of or more of our outstanding common stock  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party acquired control of of our outstanding common stock  authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders  and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in between january  and december   the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq global select market  ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  annual and quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by zoran or its competitors  loss of key personnel  proprietary rights or other litigation  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and developments in the financial markets 
from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of our common stock 
item b unresolved staff comments none item properties our executive offices and principal marketing  sales and product development operations are located in approximately  square feet of leased space in sunnyvale  california  under a lease that expires in september a significant portion of our research and development and engineering facilities and our administration  marketing and sales operations are currently located in approximately  square feet of leased space in an industrial park in haifa  israel under a lease expiring in november we also lease facilities  primarily for sales  product development  and technical support  in burlington  massachusetts  manchester  england  dortmund  germany  tokyo  japan  seoul  korea  taipei  taiwan and shenzhen  shanghai and hong kong  china 
we believe that our current facilities are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and that  should it be needed  suitable additional space in each of the locations in which we operate will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations on commercially reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings matters related to historical stock option practices as discussed further below  certain persons and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of zoran have filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the company against various of the company s current and former directors and officers relating to the company s historical accounting for stock options 
it is not possible for us to quantify the extent of our potential liability  if any 
pfeiffer v 
zoran corporation et al 
on september   a purported shareholder derivative action was filed by milton pfeiffer against zoran as a nominal defendant and certain of its officers and directors in the united states district court  northern district of california  alleging  among other things  violations of federal securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duties 
gerald del rosario v 
aharon et al 
on september   a purported shareholder derivative action was filed by gerald del rosario against zoran as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the united states district court  northern district of california  alleging  among other things  violations of federal securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duty 
on december   the court issued an order consolidating the del rosario action with the pfeiffer action 
the court selected del rosario as lead plaintiff and approved lead plaintiff s selection of counsel for the consolidated derivative action 
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on march  on june  the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to dismiss 
the case is currently in the discovery phase

gerzberg et al 
on october   two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed by moshe barone and john durco against zoran as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the california superior court of santa clara county  alleging  among other things  violations of state securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duty 
on january  the court consolidated the barone and durco actions  appointed messrs 
barone and durco as co lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of counsel for the consolidated derivative action 
the co lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on march  on june  the court issued an order staying all proceedings until further order of the court 
us attorney investigations on july   zoran disclosed in a press release that it received a grand jury subpoena from the office of the us attorney for the northern district of california requesting documents from through the present referring to  relating to or involving stock options 
zoran intends to continue cooperating fully with investigations by the us attorney  or any other government regulator relating to historical stock option practices 
zoran corporation v 
arcsoft  inc on february   the company filed a complaint against arcsoft inc  in the california superior court for the county of alameda  seeking payment of  in principal under four separate convertible promissory notes  together with accrued interest thereon in the amount of approximately  the notes represent amounts loaned by the company to arcsoft in at that time  the company also entered into a business arrangement with arcsoft involving the licensing and grant of certain rights to arcsoft related to a product then under development and related agreements regarding the continued development and commercialization of the product 
on march   arcsoft filed an answer denying liability under the notes and asserting various affirmative defenses 
arcsoft also filed a cross complaint alleging fraud in the inducement of the business arrangement  fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation  breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  and unjust enrichment and seeking monetary damages of more than  the company filed an answer to arcsoft s cross complaint denying liability and asserting various affirmative defenses 
the company also filed a cross complaint alleging various breach of contract claims against arcsoft 
on august   the court denied the company s application for a writ of attachment and its petition to compel arbitration of the dispute 
on november   the parties held a mediation  which did not result in resolution of the litigation 
trial is currently scheduled to begin on july  indemnification obligations 
subject to certain limitations  the company is obligated to indemnify its current and former directors  officers and employees in connection with the investigation of the company s historical stock option practices and related government inquiries and litigation 
these obligations arise under the terms of the company s certificate of incorporation  its bylaws  applicable contracts  and delaware and california law 
the obligation to indemnify generally means that the company is required to pay or reimburse the individuals reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters 
the company is currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of its current and former directors  officers and employees 
other legal matters 
the company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business 
litigation  in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict

the company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason  except as required by law 
overview our products consist of integrated circuits and related products used in dvd players  digital television  digital cameras and video editing systems 
we provide integrated circuits  software and platforms for imaging applications that enable the delivery and display of digital video content through a set top box or television as well as digital imaging products consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable users to print  scan  process and transmit documents to computer peripherals that perform printing functions 
we also provide high performance  low power application processors  technology and products for the multimedia mobile phone market 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that incorporate them into products for consumer and commercial applications 
revenues we derive most of our revenues from the sale of integrated circuits and related products 
in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  average selling prices historically have decreased over the life of a particular product 
average selling prices for our hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  primarily as a result of changes in our customer mix of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  sales versus sales to resellers and the transition from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have periodically reduced the prices of some of our products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with certainty 
we also derive revenue from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenues have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  on a quarterly basis 
licensing revenue includes one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
licensing revenue can be significantly affected by the timing of a small number of licensing transactions 
in addition  we have historically generated a portion of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers  although development revenue has declined substantially as a percentage of total revenues over the past several years 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
these development contracts provide for license and milestone payments that are recorded as development revenue 
we classify all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
we retain ownership of the intellectual property under these development contracts 
while we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  we expect development revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our software license agreements typically include obligations to provide maintenance and other support over a fixed term and allow for renewal of maintenance services on an annual basis 
we determine the fair value of our maintenance obligations with reference to substantive renewal rates within the agreement or objective evidence of fair value as required under sop maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we also receive royalty revenues based on per unit shipments of products embedding our software  which we recognize upon receipt of a royalty report from the customer  typically one quarter in arrears 
cost of hardware product revenues our cost of hardware product revenues consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of hardware product revenues to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing fluctuations in margins 
research and development our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive  and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support our anticipated growth 
income taxes in  we had a one time tax benefit of million recognized due to the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of previously unbenefitted net operating losses which we have utilized to reduce tax expense for us federal income tax purposes  and by our israel subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in acquisition oren semiconductor  inc on june   we completed our acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc oren  a privately held provider of demodulator ics for the global high definition television market 
prior to this acquisition  we had made investments in oren that represented a ownership interest 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired the remaining of oren s outstanding stock by means of a merger of oren with a wholly owned subsidiary of zoran  in consideration for which we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued  shares of zoran common stock valued at million  for total consideration of million  to the other stockholders of oren and to employees holding oren options 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of oren have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we recorded retroactive losses under accounting principles board opinion apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  to record the losses on investment of the prior ownership of oren semiconductor  inc under the equity basis 
accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december  and include oren s operations for the full year  our results of operations for the year ended december  include oren s operations between june  and december  and  representing our portion of the losses incurred by oren between january  and june  segments our products are based on highly integrated application specific integrated circuits and system on a chip solutions 
we also license software and other intellectual property 
we operate in two reportable segments consumer group and imaging group 
the consumer group provides products for use in dvd players  recordable dvd players  standard and high definition digital television products  digital camera products and multimedia mobile phone products 
the imaging group provides products used in digital copiers  laser and inkjet printers as well as multifunction peripherals 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including bad debt  inventories  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we generally recognize product sales to distributors at the time of shipment 
however  in some cases we grant rights of return or provide price protection arrangements 
we establish a reserve for the estimated allowances and recognize the balance of the product revenue associated with that arrangement upon shipment 
the deferred revenue balance from these arrangements at the end of each accounting period was not material 
revenue from development contracts is generally recognized as the services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
revenue from litigation settlement is recognized in accordance with the terms of the agreement when actual cash payments are received 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
inventory write downs are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until such inventory is sold or scrapped 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the delays or inability of certain customers to make required payments 
these allowances are estimated based on both specific identification of facts and circumstances with respect to each doubtful account 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
with respect to both goodwill and long lived assets  factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we have accounted for stock based compensation using the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r revised  share based payment sfas r sec staff accounting bulletin sab we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas r 
sfas r requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of underlying stock 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of our common stock 
we determined that historical volatility is reflective of market conditions and a good indicator of expected volatility 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we also used historical volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
we have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
we followed paragraph of sfas r to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the additional paid in capital apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 
we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
see note to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for a detailed description 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
realization of deferred tax assets is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the release of our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
historical operating income and continuing projected income represent sufficient positive evidence that we now believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be utilized and accordingly  a release of our valuation allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter of we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as of january  prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the best estimate of known tax contingencies 
fin no 
requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
fin no 
permits us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of success upon settlement 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and related regulations 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
with respect to mergers and acquisitions  we assess the technological feasibility of in process research and development projects and determine the number of alternative future uses for the technology being developed 
to the extent there are no alternative future uses we allocate a portion of the purchase price to in process research and development expense 
this expense is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this analysis includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  we have historically engaged an external appraiser to assist with the assumptions and models used in this analysis 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated and percentage changes from period to period percentage change years ended december  to to revenues hardware product revenues software and other revenues license revenues related to litigation settlement total revenues cost and expenses cost of hardware product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets amortization of stock compensation resulting from business combinations in process research and development total costs and expenses operating income loss interest income other income loss  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss supplemental operating data product gross margin not meaningful year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in total revenues for the year ended december  included million in revenues related to the litigation settlement that did not recur 
excluding the litigation settlement revenues  revenues for increased by million compared to the same period in this increase was a result of a million increase in the consumer segment revenues and an million increase in the imaging segment revenues 
the increase in consumer segment revenues in was driven by an increase in revenues for mobile products of million or offset by decreases in revenues of million and million for dvd and dtv products respectively 
the increase in imaging segment revenues in of million or was due to an increase in hardware product revenues of million and an increase in software and other revenues of million 
hardware product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in reflecting increases of million in the consumer segment and million in the imaging segment 
the increase in both the consumer and imaging segment revenues were primarily driven by increased unit shipments 
within the consumer segment  hardware product revenues increased million for mobile products and million for dtv products  partially offset by a decrease of million for dvd products 
the increase in hardware product revenues for mobile and dtv products was driven by increased unit shipments while the decrease in hardware product revenues for dvd products was due to a decrease in average selling prices 
software and other revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to a million increase in imaging segment revenues driven by a million increase in royalty revenue 
cost of hardware product revenues cost of hardware product revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in costs was primarily a result of the corresponding increase in hardware product revenues 
as a percentage of hardware product revenues  hardware product costs were in compared to in the decrease in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues in versus was associated with lower per unit product costs and a change in product mix as revenues from the lower margin dvd product line represented a smaller proportion of total hardware product revenue with a relative increase in revenue from the higher margin mobile and imaging product lines 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase from fluctuations based on the timing of tape outs which include mask sets and engineering wafers and continued investments in research and development across all our segments 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in from million in  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in legal fees by million incurred in connection with the ongoing stock option review and other litigation matters and continued increases in marketing and field application support expenses to support revenue growth in our asia pacific markets 
sg a expenses in included a million provision for doubtful accounts to cover slow paying accounts 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of million or as a portion of our intangible assets became fully amortized during the current year 
at december   we had approximately million in net intangible assets that we will continue to amortize on a straight line basis through interest and other income loss the increase in interest and other income in compared to reflect higher average cash and investment balances 
other income loss in included foreign currency remeasurement losses as a result of the decline in the value of the us dollar in comparison to currencies in countries in which we operate as well as a write down of a long term equity investment in a private company by million 
provision benefit for income taxes the tax benefit for the year ended december  of million reflects a provision of million and a benefit of million from the release of the valuation allowance at december  we now believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in the future  and accordingly  we released the valuation allowance on those assets at year end 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence now supports the conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result  the balance sheet now reflects million of deferred tax assets 
the offsetting benefit was allocated million to decrease goodwill and million to previously unbenefitted withholding taxes and million to deferred tax benefit 
the current provision of million is primarily due to federal and foreign accrued liabilities 
the tax provision for the year ended december  of million included a one time charge of million for tax expense related to litigation settlement 
the remaining tax expense is related to the utilization of previously unbenefitted purchased nols which when utilized reduce goodwill and not tax expense along with statutory taxes in our non us subsidiaries 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of previously unbenefitted nols which we have utilized to reduce tax expense for us federal income tax purposes and by our israel based subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal nols expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase was a result of a million increase in consumer segment revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in the imaging segment 
within the consumer segment  license revenues related to the litigation settlement accounted for million of the increase while the remaining increase was primarily a result of increase in hardware product revenues of million 
the decrease in imaging segment revenues in was primarily due to a million decrease in hardware product revenues due to decrease in unit shipments 
hardware product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in hardware product revenues was driven by growth in consumer segment product revenues 
within the consumer segment  hardware product revenues increased primarily due to a million increase in the mobile product line and million increase in the dtv product line  in each case driven by increased unit shipments offset by a reduction of million in the dvd product line attributable to reductions in unit shipments and average selling prices 
software and other revenues remained essentially unchanged at million and million in and  respectively 
cost of hardware product revenues cost of hardware product revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in costs was primarily a result of the corresponding increase in hardware product revenues 
as a percentage of hardware product revenues  hardware product costs were in compared to in hardware product costs for included adjustments resulting in a million decrease in inventory 
excluding the benefit of the net reduction in the inventory allowance  hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues would have been in with no significant change in the decrease in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues in to compared to the adjusted costs of in reflected a change in product mix as revenues from the lower margin dvd product line represented a smaller proportion of total hardware product revenue with a relative increase in revenue from the higher margin mobile and dtv product lines 
research and development research and development r d expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in was primarily due to stock based compensation expenses of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas r  compared with stock based compensation expense of million in prior to the adoption of sfas r  the inclusion of the operations of oren which was acquired in june for the full year in as well as continued investments in research and development across all of our segments 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to stock based compensation expenses of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas r  compared with stock based compensation expense of million in prior to the adoption of sfas r  million of expenses in connection with the ongoing stock option review  continued increases in marketing and field application support expenses to support revenue growth in our asia pacific markets and the inclusion of the operations of oren which was acquired in june for the full year in this increase was partially offset by the reduction of legal fees as a result of the completion of the mediatek litigation 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in from million in at december   we had approximately million in net intangible assets acquired through the oak  emblaze and oren acquisitions which we will continue to amortize on a straight line basis for various periods extending through amortization of stock compensation resulting from business combinations as a result of the adoption of sfas r during the first quarter of  we now record a charge for all stock based compensation expenses as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements and no longer record a separate charge for amortization of stock compensation resulting from business combinations 
in  we recorded charges of million related to the amortization of stock compensation resulting from business combinations primarily as a result of stock options granted in connection with the oak acquisition 
in process research and development there were no charges recorded for in process research and development during in  approximately million of the purchase price of oren semiconductor  inc was allocated to in process research and development for projects which had not reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
this amount was determined using management s estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser 
at december   there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired in process research and development 
interest income interest income increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of higher average cash and short term investment balances and the higher interest rates during provision for income taxes the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to utilization of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and state of israel tax benefits on foreign earnings 
the provision is primarily due to domestic income offset by previously unbenefitted purchased nols which when utilized reduce goodwill and not tax expense 
for the year ended december   the company reduced its income tax reserves by million 
this was due to an expiring statute of limitations and the settlement of a domestic income tax audit 
realization of deferred tax assets is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
historical operating losses and continuing business uncertainty represent sufficient negative evidence which it was difficult for positive evidence to overcome under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded 
if the facts or estimates of future financial results were to change  increasing the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
at december   we had million of working capital 
our operating activities generated cash of million during  primarily due to net income of million and non cash items such as amortization of million  depreciation of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
cash provided by operations also increased due to a million increase in accounts payable  million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments 
these increases were partially offset by our deferred tax benefit of million due to the release of the deferred tax valuation allowance  an increase in accounts receivable by million due to increase in revenues  an increase in inventories by million to meet the increasing demand for our products and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets by million 
cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the net purchase of investments of million 
in addition we spent million for the purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and consisted of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our operating activities generated cash of million during  primarily due to net income of million and non cash items such as amortization of million  depreciation of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
cash provided by operations also increased due to a net decrease of million in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in inventories to meet the increasing demand for our products  net decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities totaling million and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the net purchase of investments of million 
in addition we spent million for purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during was million consisting of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to the type of financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flows from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next months 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  volume pricing concessions  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  the response of competitors to our products  and our relationships with our suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for additional acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter operating leases and license commitments    purchase commitments   total       the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million as a disallowance of these items would be primarily reflected as an adjustment to our deferred tax assets and would not result in a significant impact on our cash balance 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate securities and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
we do not maintain derivative financial instruments 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel and in asia are transacted in foreign currencies 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our business in the future
