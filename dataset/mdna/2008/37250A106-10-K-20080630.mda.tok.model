the number and size of three of our largest contract manufacturing customers has declined in the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
this is due to an overall economic decline due to timing of our customers advertising and period sensitive promotions which directly affects our business segment s manufacturing orders related to our customers branded product demands which is outside of our control 
manufacturing capacities and capabilities continue to be increased as we continue to enhance our existing core manufacturing equipment and standard operating procedures 
as we expect customer advertising and period sensitive promotions to continue to increase  as they have since the december quarter  we expect to have increases in the number and size of orders 
distribution revenues decreased approximately million or to approximately million for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  overall  sales prices vary for all product lines dependent upon a customer s individual as well as aggregate purchase volumes in addition to the number of distribution points of sale and advertising dollars projected to be spent 
for the fiscal year ended march    cases of hoodia dex l were sold versus  cases sold for the fiscal year ended march   based on increased competition at the mass retail chain level where the majority of the product is sold in addition to the previous period included new mass chain store introductions

current increases in this type of labor based direct overhead costs are in line with our planned improvements surrounding enhanced standard operating and manufacturing procedures in all of our manufacturing plants 
we expect that these improvements will continue to increase our visibility in the marketplaces that we compete in for new and expanded business for the upcoming fiscal year

pharmaceutical gross profits decreased approximately  to approximately a gross profit deficit of million for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in gross profit deficit for this business segment for the fiscal year ended march  this was based primarily on the cephalasporin and beta lactam facilities that have no revenue streams but have costs associated with overall research and product development  and production and laboratory direct labor costs 
the largo  florida generic drug plant has commenced initial manufacturing and has begun shipping vetprofen  its branded generic carprofen during the fourth fiscal quarter ended march  which has assisted in offsetting some of the costs associated with other research and product development  production and laboratory direct costs related to the pharmaceutical segment 
the largo  florida cephalasporin and generic drug plants incurred approximately million of costs with the baltimore  maryland beta lactam facility having incurred approximately  of costs with revenue offsets of approximately  the drug revenues derived were generated from our generic drug plant in largo  florida 
we are awaiting fda facility approval of both the baltimore  maryland beta lactam and the largo  florida cephalosporin drug facility plants and we estimate and anticipate that we will begin to derive revenues during the second or third quarter of the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sga expenses consist of advertising and promotional expenses  stock compensation costs  insurance costs  research and development costs associated with the generic drug segment  personnel costs related to general management functions  finance  accounting and information systems  payroll expenses and sales commissions  professional fees related to legal  audit and tax matters  and depreciation and amortization expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  inclusive of stock compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses  increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to approximately million in the corresponding period 
an increase of approximately  was due to the increase in purchased depreciable assets related to generic drug  cosmeceutical and nutraceutical manufacturing  approximately  in additional advertising and promotional expenses associated with promoting our distribution segment and related branded product lines  including hoodia dex l and dex c  and approximately  in increased accounting costs associated with the initial implementation of sarbanes oxley compliance 
combined insurance costs have increased  in total  including health  general and product liability insurances  health insurance increased primarily due to an increase in the cost per employee and the number of employees  in addition to external insurance market influences surrounding higher premium costs for all of our business segments  consulting  officer and employee salaries have increased  in total based on increases in the number of personnel in addition to merit increases and bonuses received  and the related increase in payroll taxes was  an increase of  in director fees  approximately  increase in utilities and approximately  increase in repairs and maintenance based on additional facilities operating in baltimore  maryland and largo  florida  all of which were partially offset by approximately  decrease in the stock compensation expense directly related to the prior period s implementation of sfas r where we recognized the value of unvested stock options whereas effective march   we replaced all unvested stock options with our three year restricted stock therefore reducing the amount of expense needed to be recognized  a decrease in legal fees of approximately  and a decrease of approximately  in rent expense 
the rent expense decrease was a noncash expense as related to our beta lactum baltimore  maryland  facility 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from in the corresponding period in operating income loss operating loss was approximately million  or of revenues for the year ended march  operating income was approximately million  or of revenues for the year ended march  other income expense  net other income expense  net was  for the year ended march   compared to approximately  for the year ended march  interest income expense  net  was approximately  for the year ended march   compared to approximately  for the year ended march  the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to interest expense associated with million convertible debt in addition to our short term obligations issued during  and was partially offset by interest capitalized on our generic pharmaceutical leasehold construction

for the year ended march   other income expense  net  of approximately  primarily consisted of customer deposits that were forfeited  in addition to recycling income 
income tax benefit expense for the year ended march   we had recorded approximately million of income tax benefit as compared to approximately  of income tax expense for the year ended march  the tax benefit was based on our tax calculation of temporary and permanent differences using the effective tax rates applied to our net loss for the year  changes in information gained related to underlying assumptions about our future operations  as well as the utilization of available operating loss carryforwards 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
based on available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the increase in the asset will be realized by carrying back approximately million of the operating loss and by carrying forward the remainder of the loss to future periods through the expiration dates of the operating loss carryforwards beginning and ending inflation and seasonality we believe that there was no material effect on our operations or our financial condition as a result of inflation as of and for the years ended march  and we also believe that our business is not seasonal  however significant promotional activities can have a direct impact on our sales volume in any given quarter 
economic and industry conditions we believe that there is a decline in general economic and industry conditions and believe that such decline has had a negative effect  that we are unable to quantify  on our operations and our financial condition as of and for the years ended march  and should there be a continued material deterioration of general economic or industry conditions  our results of operations could further be impacted in any given quarter

march  fiscal year ended cash flow analysis the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past two fiscal years fiscal year total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to our non cash based acquisition of boss on october   note herein that apparent changes in our balance sheet as of march  and our related statement of operations for the year ended march   will not be reflected in this cash flow analysis  due to the non cash basis of the transaction 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for fiscal  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately  for the fiscal the decline in operating cash flows for fiscal  compared with the prior fiscal year  was due primarily to a decrease in cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities  as well as our net loss 

table of contents we incurred a net loss before preferred stock dividends of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income before preferred stock dividends of approximately million for fiscal the changes in operating assets and liabilities were due primarily to the increase in accounts receivable  other  and a decrease in accrued expenses and other payables  all of which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets  deferred tax asset  intangible and other assets  media credits  and amounts due from affiliates  as well as an increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable  other  was primarily related to reimbursements due from a customer  which may exceed customary credit terms  for product and mass chain shelving requirements that we advanced 
the decrease in accrued expenses and other payables resulted from the timing of vendor payments 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in credit sales and our increased collection efforts 
inventories decreased primarily due to changes in our product mix and our efforts to improve our levels of inventory on hand 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the timing of insurance policy renewals 
the decrease in media credits was due to the expiration of all available credits 
the decrease in amounts due from affiliates was based on the timing of payments received 
the increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from higher business volumes and the timing of vendor payments 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal  as compared to net cash used of approximately million for fiscal the change in fiscal was due primarily to a certificate of deposit investment with the source of those funds being a portion of the gross proceeds received from the whitebox private placement closed in april  leasehold improvement and equipment purchases  the receipt of a note receivable from boss prior to our acquisition of boss  intangible asset purchases  and usage related to the minority interest associated with american antibiotics plant in baltimore  maryland  all of which were partially offset by proceeds received from a matured certificate of deposit  cash acquired upon the acquisition of boss  and repayments of notes receivable 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal  as compared to cash provided by financing activities of approximately million for fiscal the change in fiscal was primarily attributable to proceeds received from private placement convertible debt and private placement common stock issuance in april  proceeds from the issuance of short term obligations and long term obligations  and proceeds from stock options exercised  all of which were partially offset by net repayments on our revolving credit facility  payments of private placement fees  payments of short term obligations  payments of long term obligations  and payments of acquisition costs 
we believe that cash expected to be generated from operations  current cash reserves  and existing financial arrangements will be sufficient for us to meet our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our operations as presently conducted 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including the level of business in existing operations  expansion of facilities  expected results from recent procedural changes surrounding the acceptance of manufacturing sales orders  and possible acquisitions 
in particular  we have added additional manufacturing lines and have purchased additional fully automated manufacturing equipment to meet our present and future growth 
our plans may require the leasing of additional facilities and or the leasing or purchase of additional equipment in the future to accommodate further expansion of our manufacturing  warehousing and related storage needs 
if cash flows from operations  current cash reserves and available credit facilities are not sufficient  it will be necessary for us to seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to us 
capital expenditure commitments the company has no contractual commitments as related to capital expenditures as of march  and however  during february  the company entered into a year  million capital lease line with a bank at libor 
as of march    was outstanding on this line 
payments due by period the following table illustrates our outstanding debt  purchase obligations  and related payment projections as of march  contractual obligations total less than year years years series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred stock dividends convertible debt convertible debt interest credit line payable loan and notes payable trade payables other liabilities and accrued expenses subtotal purchase obligations capital leases operating leases total footnote the payments to be made are eligible to be paid in cash or in the form of the company s par value common stock at the company s option
