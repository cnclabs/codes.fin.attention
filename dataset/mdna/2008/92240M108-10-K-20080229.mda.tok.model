we are a holding company and depend on cash payments from our subsidiaries  which are subject to contractual and other restrictions  in order to service our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock 
we are a holding company and have no operations of our own 
we hold our interests in our various businesses through our wholly owned subsidiaries  vgr holding and new valley 
in addition to our own cash resources  our ability to pay interest on our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock depends on the ability of vgr holding and new valley to make cash available to us 
vgr holding s ability to pay dividends to us depends primarily on the ability of liggett  its wholly owned subsidiary  to generate cash and make it available to vgr holding 
liggett s revolving credit agreement with wachovia bank  na contains a restricted payments test that limits the ability of liggett to pay cash dividends to vgr holding 
the ability of liggett to meet the restricted payments test may be 
table of contents affected by factors beyond its control  including wachovia s unilateral discretion  if acting in good faith  to modify elements of such test 
our receipt of cash payments  as dividends or otherwise  from our subsidiaries is an important source of our liquidity and capital resources 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources of our own and do not receive payments from our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to repay our debts and to pay dividends on our common stock  we must obtain additional funds from other sources 
there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain additional funds at all or on terms acceptable to us 
our inability to service these obligations and to continue to pay dividends on our common stock would significantly harm us and the value of our common stock 
our senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility 
our senior secured notes due contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to take specific actions  even if we believe them to be in our best interest  including restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  create liens with respect to our assets  make investments  loans or advances  prepay subordinated indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  and merge  consolidate  reorganize or sell our assets 
in addition  liggett s revolving credit agreement requires us to meet specified financial ratios 
these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the liggett revolving credit agreement may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in general business and economic conditions  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants  including those contain in the indenture governing the notes and the liggett s credit agreement  could result in a default under our indebtedness  which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable 
if any of our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay it 
the notes contain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay certain dividends or make other restricted payments or enter into transactions with affiliates if our consolidated ebitda  as defined in the indenture  is less than million for the four quarters prior to such transaction 
liggett faces intense competition in the domestic tobacco industry 
liggett is considerably smaller and has fewer resources than its major competitors and  as a result  has a more limited ability to respond to market developments 
management science associates data indicate that the three largest cigarette manufacturers controlled approximately of the united states cigarette market during philip morris is the largest and most profitable manufacturer in the market  and its profits are derived principally from its sale of premium cigarettes 
philip morris had approximately of the premium segment and of the total domestic market during during  all of liggett s sales were in the discount segment  and its share of the total domestic cigarette market was 
philip morris and rjr tobacco which is now part of reynolds american  the two largest cigarette manufacturers  have historically  because of their dominant market share  been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry 
market pressures have historically caused the other cigarette manufacturers to bring their prices into line with the levels established by these two major manufacturers 
in july  rjr tobacco and brown williamson  the second and third largest cigarette manufacturers  completed the combination of their united states tobacco businesses to create reynolds american 
this transaction has further consolidated the dominance of the domestic cigarette market by philip morris and reynolds american  
table of contents which had a combined market share of approximately at december  this concentration of united states market share could make it more difficult for liggett and vector tobacco to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market  either of which could have a material adverse affect on their sales volume  operating income and cash flows  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett s business is highly dependent on the discount cigarette segment 
liggett depends more on sales in the discount cigarette segment of the market  relative to the full price premium segment  than its major competitors 
all of liggett s unit volume in and was generated in the discount segment 
the discount segment is highly competitive  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price 
while the three major manufacturers all compete with liggett in the discount segment of the market  the strongest competition for market share has recently come from a group of smaller manufacturers and importers  most of which sell low quality  deep discount cigarettes 
while liggett s share of the discount market increased to in from in and in  management science associates data indicate that the discount market share of these other smaller manufacturers and importers was approximately in  in and in if pricing in the discount market continues to be impacted by these smaller manufacturers and importers  margins in liggett s only current market segment could be negatively affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett s market share is susceptible to decline 
in years prior to  liggett suffered a substantial decline in unit sales and associated market share 
liggett s unit sales and market share increased during each of  and  and its market share increased in while its unit sales declined 
in and  liggett s unit sales and market share increased compared to after declines in and compared to the prior year 
this earlier market share erosion resulted in part from liggett s highly leveraged capital structure that existed until december and its limited ability to match other competitors wholesale and retail trade programs  obtain retail shelf space for its products and advertise its brands 
the decline in recent years also resulted from adverse developments in the tobacco industry  intense competition and changes in consumer preferences 
according to management science associates data  liggett s overall domestic market share during was compared to during and during liggett s share of the discount segment during was compared to in  up from in if liggett s market share declines  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett has significant sales to a single customer 
during  of liggett s total revenues and of our consolidated revenues were generated by sales to liggett s largest customer 
liggett s contract with this customer currently extends through march  if this customer discontinues its relationship with liggett or experiences financial difficulties  liggett s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the domestic cigarette industry has experienced declining unit sales in recent periods 
industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states have been generally declining for a number of years  with published industry sources estimating that domestic industry wide shipments decreased by approximately in according to management science associates data  domestic industry wide shipments decreased by in compared to we believe that industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states will generally continue to decline as a result of numerous factors 
these factors include health considerations  diminishing social acceptance of smoking  and a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants  bars and other public places  as well as federal and state excise tax increases and settlement related expenses which have contributed to high cigarette price levels in recent years 
if this decline in industry wide shipments continues and liggett is unable to capture market share from its competitors  or if the industry as a whole is unable to offset the decline in unit sales with price increases  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 

table of contents litigation will continue to harm the tobacco industry 
the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of february   there were approximately  individual suits   of which were recently filed in florida  purported class actions and four governmental and other third party payor health care reimbursement actions pending in the united states in which liggett and or us were named defendants 
it is likely that similar legal actions  proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against liggett 
punitive damages  often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars  are specifically pled in these cases  in addition to compensatory and other damages 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a civil lawsuit was filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately billion from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
in august  the trial court entered a final judgment and remedial order against each of the cigarette manufacturing defendants  except liggett 
the final judgment  among other things  ordered the following relief against the non liggett defendants i the defendants are enjoined from committing any act of racketeering concerning the manufacturing  marketing  promotion  health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states  ii the defendants are enjoined from making any material false  misleading  or deceptive statement or representation concerning cigarettes that persuades people to purchase cigarettes  iii the defendants are permanently enjoined from utilizing lights  low tar  ultra lights  mild  or natural descriptors  or conveying any other express or implied health messages in connection with the marketing or sale of cigarettes as of january   iv the defendants must make corrective statements on their websites  and in television and print media advertisements  v the defendants must maintain internet document websites until with access to smoking and health related documents  vi the defendants must disclose all disaggregated marketing data to the government on a confidential basis  vii the defendants are not permitted to sell or otherwise transfer any of their cigarette brands  product formulas or businesses to any person or entity for domestic use without a court order  and unless the acquiring person or entity will be bound by the terms of the final judgment  and viii the defendants must pay the appropriate costs of the government in prosecuting the action  in an amount to be determined by the trial court 
no monetary damages were awarded other than the government s costs 
in october  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the final judgment pending appeal 
the defendants filed amended notices of appeal in march the government acknowledged in its appellate brief that it was not appealing the district court s decision to award no remedy against liggett 
therefore  although this case has been concluded as to liggett  it is unclear what impact  if any  the final judgment will have on the cigarette industry as a whole 
to the extent that the final judgment leads to a decline in industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states or otherwise imposes regulations which adversely affect the industry  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
a west virginia state court consolidated approximately individual actions that were pending prior to for trial of some common issues 
the consolidation was affirmed on appeal by the west virginia supreme court 
in january  the court severed liggett from the trial of the consolidated action 
it is estimated that liggett could be a defendant in approximately of the cases 
the action is currently stayed 
two purported class actions have been certified in state court in kansas and new mexico alleging antitrust violations 
as new cases are commenced  the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase 
class action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers  alleging  among other things  that the use of the terms light and ultralight constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices 
one such suit schwab v 
philip morris  pending in federal court in new york since  seeks to create a nationwide class of light cigarette smokers 
the action asserts claims under racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
the proposed class is seeking as much as billion in damages  which could be 
table of contents trebled under rico 
in november  the court ruled that the plaintiffs would be permitted to calculate damages on an aggregate basis and use fluid recovery theories to allocate them among class members  if the class was certified 
fluid recovery would permit potential damages to be paid out in ways other than merely giving cash directly to plaintiffs  such as establishing a pool of money that could be used for public purposes 
in september  the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification 
in november  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit granted the defendants motions to stay the district court proceedings and for review of the class certification ruling 
oral argument was held in july and the parties are awaiting a decision 
liggett is a defendant in the schwab case 
there are currently three individual tobacco related actions pending where liggett is the only tobacco company defendant 
in april  in one of these cases  a jury in a florida state court action awarded compensatory damages of  against liggett 
in addition  plaintiff s counsel was awarded legal fees of  liggett has appealed both the verdict and the legal fees award 
in october  the fourth district court of appeals affirmed the compensatory award 
liggett filed a motion for rehearing and or certification which is currently pending before the appellate court 
in march  in another case in florida state court in which liggett is the only defendant  the court granted liggett s motion for summary judgment 
the plaintiff appealed and  in june  a florida intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the case back to the trial court 
the court granted leave to plaintiff to add a claim for punitive damages 
trial commenced on february  and on february  the court declared a mistrial 
individual tobacco related cases have increased as a result of the florida supreme court s ruling in engle 
in may  a florida intermediate appellate court overturned a million punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle v 
r 
j 
reynolds tobacco co 
smoking and health class action 
in july  the florida supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part the may intermediate appellate court decision 
among other things  the florida supreme court affirmed the decision decertifying the class on a prospective basis and the order vacating the punitive damages award  but preserved several of the trial court s phase i findings including that i smoking causes lung cancer  among other diseases  ii nicotine in cigarettes is addictive  iii defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous  iv the defendants concealed material information  v all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective  and vi all defendants were negligent and allowed plaintiffs to proceed to trial on individual liability issues using the above findings and compensatory and punitive damage issues  provided they commence their individual lawsuits within one year of the date the court s decision became final on january   the date of the court s mandate 
in december  the florida supreme court added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that  at the time of sale or supply  did not conform to the representations made by defendants 
class counsel filed motions for attorneys fees and costs  which motions are pending 
in may  the defendants  including liggett  filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court 
the petition was denied in september in october  defendants filed a petition for rehearing before the united states supreme court which was denied in november in june  the jury in a florida state court action entitled lukacs v 
rj reynolds tobacco company  awarded  in compensatory damages in a case involving liggett and two other cigarette manufacturers 
in march  the court reduced the amount of the compensatory damages to  the jury found liggett responsible for the damages incurred by the plaintiff 
the lukacs case was the first case to be tried as an individual engle class member suit following entry of final judgment by the engle trial court 
after the verdict was returned  the case was abated pending completion of the engle appeal 
after the issuance of the florida supreme court s opinion discussed above  the plaintiff filed a motion requesting that the trial court enter partial final judgment  tax costs and attorneys fees and schedule trial on the punitive damages claims 
defendants have opposed the relief sought by plaintiff on the grounds that the reversal by the florida supreme court of the engle phase i finding on fraud mandates the reversal of the jury verdict and precludes the entry of final judgment in plaintiff s favor 
if the court enters judgment in plaintiff s favor  plaintiff contends that interest on the judgment accrues from the date of the verdict 
plaintiff has filed a motion seeking an award of attorneys fees from liggett based on their prior proposal for settlement 
oral argument was held in march and the parties are awaiting a decision 
liggett may 
table of contents be required to bond the amount of the judgment against it to perfect its appeal 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
we cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
pursuant to the florida supreme court s july ruling in engle  former class members had one year from january  to file individual lawsuits 
in addition  some individuals who filed suit prior to january   and who claim they meet the conditions in engle  are attempting to avail themselves of the engle ruling 
lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the engle ruling  whether filed before or after the january  mandate  are referred to as the engle progeny cases 
as of february   there were approximately  engle progeny cases filed and served  in both state and federal courts in florida  where either liggett and other cigarette manufacturers or us  or both  were named as defendants 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs 
plaintiffs have days to serve cases filed before the deadline  so the total number of cases could increase substantially 
regulation and legislation may negatively impact sales of tobacco products and our financial condition 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes and these laws have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
there are various other legislative efforts pending on the federal and state level which seek to  among other things  eliminate smoking in public places  further restrict displays and advertising of cigarettes  require additional warnings  including graphic warnings  on cigarette packaging and advertising  ban vending machine sales and curtail affirmative defenses of tobacco companies in product liability litigation 
the trend has had  and is more likely to continue to have  an adverse effect on us 
in addition to the foregoing  there have been a number of other restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the fda 
there have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
recently  legislation was reintroduced in congress providing for regulation of cigarettes by the fda 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
additionally  more than states have passed legislation providing for reduced ignition propensity standards for cigarettes 
these developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry  possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation  and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
liggett may have additional payment obligations under the master settlement agreement and its other settlement agreements with the states 
in october  the independent auditor under the master settlement agreement notified liggett and all other participating manufacturers that their payment obligations under the master settlement agreement  dating from the agreement s execution in late  had been recalculated using net unit amounts  rather than gross unit amounts which had been used since to calculate market share on the allocation of the base annual payment under the master settlement agreement 
the change in the method of calculation could  among other things  require additional payments by liggett under the master settlement agreement of approximately million  plus interest  for the periods through  require liggett to pay an additional amount of approximately million for and require additional amounts in future periods because the proposed change from gross to net would serve to lower liggett s market share exemption under the master settlement agreement 
liggett has objected to this retroactive change and has disputed the change in methodology 
no amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any potential liability relating to the gross versus net dispute 

table of contents in  the independent auditor calculated that liggett owed million for its sales 
in april  liggett paid million and disputed the balance  as permitted by the master settlement agreement 
liggett subsequently paid an additional million of the disputed amount  although liggett continues to dispute that this amount is owed 
this million relates to an adjustment to its payment obligation claimed by liggett for the market share loss to non participating manufacturers  which is known as the npm adjustment 
the remaining balance in dispute of million  which was withheld from payment  is comprised of million claimed for a npm adjustment and million relating to the independent auditor s retroactive change from gross to net units in calculating master settlement agreement payments  which liggett contends is improper  as discussed above 
from its april payment  liggett withheld million claimed for the npm adjustment and million relating to the retroactive change from gross to net units 
liggett and vector tobacco withheld approximately million from their april payments related to the npm adjustment and million relating to the retroactive change from gross to net units 
the following amounts have not been accrued in our consolidated financial statements as they relate to liggett s claims for npm adjustments million for  million for and million for in  the attorneys general for each of florida  mississippi and texas advised liggett that they believed that liggett had failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states for the period through and that additional payments may be due for and subsequent years 
liggett believes these allegations are without merit  based  among other things  on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements 
in december  florida offered to settle all amounts allegedly owed by liggett for the period through for the sum of million 
in november  the state of mississippi offered to settle all amounts allegedly owed by liggett for the period through for the sum of million 
in  liggett was served with a day notice to cure alleged defaults by each of florida and mississippi 
no specific monetary demand has been made by texas 
except for million accrued at december   in connection with the foregoing matters  no other amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by liggett under the settlement agreements with florida  mississippi and texas 
there can be no assurance that liggett will prevail in any of these matters and that liggett will not be required to make additional material payments  which payments could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and the value of our common stock 
liggett may be adversely affected by recent legislation to eliminate the federal tobacco quota system 
in october  federal legislation was enacted which eliminated the federal tobacco quota system and price support system through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders 
pursuant to the legislation  manufacturers of tobacco products will be assessed billion over a ten year period to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights 
cigarette manufacturers will initially be responsible for of the assessment subject to adjustment in the future  which will be allocated based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
liggett s and vector tobacco s assessment was million in  million in and million in the relative cost of the legislation to each of the three largest cigarette manufacturers will likely be less than the cost to smaller manufacturers  including liggett and vector tobacco  because one effect of the legislation is that the three largest manufacturers will no longer be obligated to make certain contractual payments  commonly known as phase ii payments  they agreed in to make to tobacco producing states 
the ultimate impact of this legislation cannot be determined  but there is a risk that smaller manufacturers  such as liggett and vector tobacco  will be disproportionately affected by the legislation  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
excise tax increases adversely affect cigarette sales 
cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal  state and local excise taxes 
the federal excise tax on cigarettes is currently per pack  although proposals are pending in congress to increase the federal excise tax by as much as per pack 
state and local sales and excise taxes vary considerably and  when combined with sales taxes  local taxes and the current federal excise tax  may currently exceed per pack 
in  states enacted increases in excise taxes 
further increases in state excise taxes are expected in congress is currently 
table of contents considering significant increases in the federal excise tax or other payments from tobacco manufacturers  and various states and other jurisdictions are considering  or have pending  legislation proposing further state excise tax increases 
further substantial federal or state excise tax increases could accelerate the trend away from smoking and could have a material adverse effect on liggett s sales and profitability  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
vector tobacco is subject to risks inherent in new product development initiatives 
we have made  and plan to continue to make  significant investments in vector tobacco s development projects in the tobacco industry 
vector tobacco is in the business of developing and marketing the low nicotine and nicotine free quest cigarette products and developing reduced risk cigarette products 
these initiatives are subject to high levels of risk  uncertainties and contingencies  including the challenges inherent in new product development 
there is a risk that continued investments in vector tobacco will harm our results of operations  liquidity or cash flow 
the substantial risks facing vector tobacco include risks of market acceptance of new products 
in november  vector tobacco launched nationwide its reduced carcinogen omni cigarettes 
during  acceptance of omni in the marketplace was limited  with revenues of only approximately million on sales of million units 
vector tobacco has not been actively marketing the omni product  and the product is not currently in distribution 
vector tobacco was unable to achieve the anticipated breadth of distribution and sales of the omni product due  in part  to the lack of success of its advertising and marketing efforts in differentiating omni from other conventional cigarettes with consumers through the reduced carcinogen message 
over the next several years  our in house research program  together with third party collaborators  plans to conduct appropriate studies relating to the development of cigarettes that materially reduce risk to smokers and  based on these studies  we will evaluate whether  and how  to further market the omni brand 
omni has not been a commercially successful product to date and is not currently being manufactured by vector tobacco 
vector tobacco introduced its low nicotine and nicotine free quest cigarettes in an initial seven state market in january and in arizona in january during the second quarter of  based on an analysis of the market data obtained since the introduction of the quest product  we determined to postpone indefinitely the national launch of quest 
a national launch of the quest brands would require the expenditure of substantial additional sums for advertising and sales promotion  with no assurance of consumer acceptance 
low nicotine and nicotine free cigarettes may not ultimately be accepted by adult smokers and also may not prove to be commercially successful products 
adult smokers may decide not to purchase cigarettes made with low nicotine and nicotine free tobaccos due to taste or other preferences or other product modifications 
third party allegations that vector tobacco products are unlawful or bear deceptive or unsubstantiated product claims 
vector tobacco is engaged in the development and marketing of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarettes and the development of reduced risk cigarette products 
with respect to omni  which is not currently being distributed by vector tobacco  reductions in carcinogens have not yet been proven to result in a safer cigarette 
like other cigarettes  the omni and quest products also produce tar  carbon monoxide  other harmful by products  and  in the case of omni  increased levels of nitric oxide and formaldehyde 
there are currently no specific governmental standards or parameters for these products and product claims 
there is a risk that federal or state regulators may object to vector tobacco s low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products and reduced risk cigarette products it may develop as unlawful or allege they bear deceptive or unsubstantiated product claims  and seek the removal of the products from the marketplace  or significant changes to advertising 
allegations by federal or state regulators  public health organizations and other tobacco manufacturers that vector tobacco s products are unlawful  or that its public statements or advertising contain misleading or unsubstantiated health claims or product comparisons  may result in litigation or governmental proceedings 
vector tobacco s defense against such claims could require it to incur substantial expense and to divert significant efforts of its scientific and marketing personnel 
an adverse determination in a judicial proceeding or by a regulatory agency could have a material and adverse impact on vector tobacco s business  operating results and prospects 

table of contents potential extensive government regulation 
vector tobacco s business may become subject to extensive additional domestic and international government regulation 
various proposals have been made for federal  state and international legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers generally  and reduced constituent cigarettes specifically 
it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering matters such as the manufacture  sale  distribution and labeling of tobacco products as well as any health claims associated with reduced risk and low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
a system of regulation by agencies such as the fda  the ftc and the usda may be established 
recently  legislation was reintroduced in congress providing for the regulation of cigarettes by the fda 
the outcome of any of the foregoing cannot be predicted  but any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on vector tobacco s business  operating results and prospects 
competition from other cigarette manufacturers with greater resources 
vector tobacco s competitors generally have substantially greater resources than vector tobacco  including financial  marketing and personnel resources 
other major tobacco companies have stated that they are working on reduced risk cigarette products and have made publicly available at this time only limited additional information concerning their activities 
philip morris has announced it is developing products that potentially reduce smokers exposure to harmful compounds in cigarette smoke 
rjr tobacco has disclosed that a primary focus for its research and development activity is the development of potentially reduced exposure products  which may ultimately be recognized as products that present reduced risks to health 
rjr tobacco has stated that it continues to sell in limited distribution throughout the country a brand of cigarettes that primarily heats rather than burns tobacco  which it claims reduces the toxicity of its smoke 
there is a substantial likelihood that other major tobacco companies will continue to introduce new products that are designed to compete directly with the low nicotine  nicotine free and reduced risk products that vector tobacco currently markets or may develop 
potential disputes concerning intellectual property 
vector tobacco s ability to commercialize its reduced carcinogen and low nicotine and nicotine free products may depend in large part on its ability to obtain and defend issued patents  to obtain further patent protection for its existing technology in the united states and abroad  and to operate without infringing on the patents and rights of others both in the united states and abroad 
additionally  it must be able to obtain appropriate licenses to patents and proprietary rights held by third parties  or issued to third parties  if infringement would otherwise occur  both in the united states and abroad 
intellectual property rights  including vector tobacco s patents involve complex legal and factual issues 
any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and granted patents could significantly limit vector tobacco s ability to obtain meaningful patent protection or to commercialize its technology 
if patents currently exist or are issued to other companies that contain claims which encompass vector tobacco s products or the processes used by vector tobacco to manufacture or develop its products  vector tobacco may be required to obtain licenses to use these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if licenses are not obtained  vector tobacco could be delayed in  or prevented from  pursuing the further development of marketing of its new cigarette products 
any alternative technology  if feasible  could take several years to develop 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost  also may be necessary to enforce any patents to which vector tobacco has rights  or to determine the scope  validity and unenforceability of other parties proprietary rights which may affect vector tobacco s rights 
vector tobacco also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of an invention or in opposition proceedings in foreign countries or jurisdictions  which could result in substantial costs 
the mere uncertainty resulting from the institution and continuation of any technology related litigation or any interference or opposition proceedings could have a material adverse effect on vector tobacco s business  operating results and prospects 
vector tobacco may also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to maintain its competitive position  which it seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  suppliers and others 
there is a risk that these agreements will be breached or terminated  that vector tobacco will not have adequate remedies for any breach  or that its trade secrets will otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 

table of contents dependence on key scientific personnel 
vector tobacco s business depends on the continued services of key scientific personnel for its continued development and growth 
the loss of dr 
anthony albino  vector tobacco s senior vice president of public health affairs  could have a serious negative impact upon vector tobacco s business  operating results and prospects 
ability to raise capital and manage growth of business 
if vector tobacco succeeds in introducing to market and increasing consumer acceptance for its new cigarette products  vector tobacco will be required to obtain significant amounts of additional capital and manage substantial volume from its customers 
there is a risk that adequate amounts of additional capital will not be available to vector tobacco to fund the growth of its business 
to accommodate growth and compete effectively  vector tobacco will also be required to attract  integrate  motivate and retain additional highly skilled sales  technical and other employees 
vector tobacco will face competition for these people 
its ability to manage volume also will depend on its ability to scale up its tobacco processing  production and distribution operations 
there is a risk that it will not succeed in scaling its processing  production and distribution operations and that its personnel  systems  procedures and controls will not be adequate to support its future operations 
potential delays in obtaining tobacco and other raw materials needed to produce products 
vector tobacco is dependent on third parties to produce tobacco and other raw materials that vector tobacco requires to manufacture its products 
in addition  the growing of new tobacco and new seeds is subject to adverse weather conditions 
the failure by such third parties to supply vector tobacco with tobacco or other raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  in the absence of readily available alternative sources  would have a serious negative impact on vector tobacco s business  operating results and prospects 
there is also a risk that interruptions in the supply of these materials may occur in the future 
any interruption in their supply could have a serious negative impact on vector tobacco 
new valley is subject to risks relating to the industries in which it operates 
risks of real estate ventures 
new valley has three significant real estate related investments  douglas elliman realty  llc  the sheraton keauhou bay resort spa which reopened in the fourth quarter and the st

new valley must seek approval from other parties for important actions regarding these joint ventures 
since these other parties interests may differ from those of new valley  a deadlock could arise that might impair the ability of the ventures to function 
such a deadlock could significantly harm the ventures 
new valley may pursue a variety of real estate development projects 
development projects are subject to special risks including potential increase in costs  changes in market demand  inability to meet deadlines which may delay the timely completion of projects  reliance on contractors who may be unable to perform and the need to obtain various governmental and third party consents

both douglas elliman and prudential douglas elliman real estate operate as franchisees of the prudential real estate affiliates  inc prudential douglas elliman operates each of its offices under its franchiser s brand name  but generally does not own any of the brand names under which it operates 
the franchiser has significant rights over the use of the franchised service marks and the conduct of the two brokerage companies business 
the franchise agreements require the companies to coordinate with the franchiser on significant matters relating to their operations  including the opening and closing of offices  make substantial royalty payments to the franchiser and contribute significant amounts to national advertising funds maintained by the franchiser  indemnify the franchiser against losses arising out of the operations of their business under the franchise agreements  and 
table of contents maintain standards and comply with guidelines relating to their operations which are applicable to all franchisees of the franchiser s real estate franchise system 
the franchiser has the right to terminate douglas elliman s and prudential douglas elliman real estate s franchises  upon the occurrence of certain events  including a bankruptcy or insolvency event  a change in control  a transfer of rights under the franchise agreement and a failure to promptly pay amounts due under the franchise agreements 
a termination of douglas elliman s or prudential douglas elliman real estate s franchise agreement could adversely affect our investment in douglas elliman realty 
the franchise agreements grant douglas elliman and prudential douglas elliman real estate exclusive franchises in new york for the counties of nassau and suffolk on long island and for manhattan  brooklyn and queens  subject to various exceptions and to meeting specified annual revenue thresholds 
if the two companies fail to achieve these levels of revenues for two consecutive years or otherwise materially breach the franchise agreements  the franchisor would have the right to terminate their exclusivity rights 
a loss of these rights could have a material adverse on douglas elliman realty 
douglas elliman realty could be negatively impacted by a downturn in the residential real estate market 
the residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in the general economic conditions that are beyond douglas elliman realty s control 
the us residential real estate market is currently in a significant downturn due to various factors including downward pressure on housing prices  credit constraints inhibiting new buyers and an exceptionally large inventory of unsold homes at the same time that sales volumes are decreasing 
we cannot predict whether the downturn will worsen or when the market and related economic forces will return the us residential real estate industry to a growth period 
any of the following could have a material adverse effect on douglas elliman realty s residential business by causing a general decline in the number of home sales and or prices  which in turn  could adversely affect its revenues and profitability periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  the general availability of mortgage financing  including the impact of the recent contraction in the subprime and mortgage markets generally  and the effect of more stringent lending standards for home mortgages  adverse changes in economic and general business conditions in the new york metropolitan area  a decrease in the affordability of homes  declining demand for real estate  a negative perception of the market for residential real estate  commission pressure from brokers who discount their commissions  acts of god  such as hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters  or acts or threats of war or terrorism  and or an increase in the cost of homeowners insurance 
all of douglas elliman realty s current operations are located in the new york metropolitan area 
local and regional economic and general business conditions in this market could differ materially from prevailing conditions in other parts of the country 
a downturn in the residential real estate market or economic conditions in that region could have a material adverse effect on douglas elliman realty and our investment in that company 
potential new investments we may make are unidentified and may not succeed 
we currently hold a significant amount of marketable securities and cash not committed to any specific investments 
this subjects a security holder to increased risk and uncertainty because a security holder will not be 
table of contents able to evaluate how this cash will be invested and the economic merits of particular investments 
there may be substantial delay in locating suitable investment opportunities 
in addition  we may lack relevant management experience in the areas in which we may invest 
there is a risk that we will fail in targeting  consummating or effectively integrating or managing any of these investments 
we depend on our key personnel 
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to assess  and our independent registered certified public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended december   and we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to continue to comply with these requirements 
we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section compliance 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered certified public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions and our reputation may be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for you to resell the shares of our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive 
the trading price of our common stock has ranged between and per share over the past weeks 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  the operating and stock performance of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contract  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the initiation or outcome of litigation  changes in interest rates  general economic  market and political conditions  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of our equity or convertible securities 
we cannot predict the extent  if any  to which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  may depress the trading price of our common stock or the value of the debentures 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these 
table of contents broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
furthermore  stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly  which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management 
these factors  among others  could significantly depress the price of our common stock 
we have many potentially dilutive securities outstanding 
at december   we had outstanding options granted to employees to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  of which options for  shares were exercisable at december  we also have outstanding convertible notes and debentures maturing in november and june  which are currently convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the issuance of these shares will cause dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the availability for sale of significant quantities of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the stock

new valley owns of douglas elliman realty  llc  which operates the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
in recent years  we have undertaken a number of initiatives to streamline the cost structure of our tobacco business and improve operating efficiency and long term earnings 
we may consider various additional opportunities to further improve efficiencies and reduce costs 
these prior initiatives have involved material restructuring and impairment charges  and any further actions taken are likely to involve material charges as well 
although management may estimate that substantial cost savings will be associated with these restructuring actions  there is a risk that these actions could have a serious negative impact on our tobacco operations and that any estimated increases in profitability cannot be achieved 
in december  we completed an exchange offer and a subsequent short form merger whereby we acquired the remaining of the common shares of new valley that we did not already own 
as a result of these transactions  new valley became our wholly owned subsidiary and each outstanding new valley common share was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
a total of approximately million of our common shares were issued to the new valley shareholders in the transactions 
all of liggett s unit sales volume in  and was in the discount segment  which liggett s management believes has been the primary growth segment in the industry for over a decade 
the significant discounting of premium cigarettes in recent years has led to brands  such as eve  that were traditionally considered premium brands to become more appropriately categorized as discount  following list price reductions 
liggett s cigarettes are produced in approximately combinations of length  style and packaging 
liggett s current brand portfolio includes liggett select the third largest brand in the deep discount category  grand prix a rapidly growing brand in the deep discount segment  eve a leading brand of millimeter cigarettes in the branded discount category  pyramid the industry s first deep discount product with a brand identity  and usa and various partner brands and private label brands 
in  liggett introduced liggett select  one of the leading brands in the deep discount category 
liggett select is now the largest seller in liggett s family of brands  comprising of liggett s unit volume in  in and in in september  liggett repositioned grand prix to distributors and retailers nationwide 
grand prix is marketed as the lowest price fighter to specifically compete with brands which are priced at the lowest level of the deep discount segment 
under the master settlement agreement reached in november with states and various territories  the three largest cigarette manufacturers must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually 
liggett  however  is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us cigarette market 
additionally  vector tobacco has no payment obligation 
table of contents unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us market 
liggett s and vector tobacco s payments under the master settlement agreement are based on each company s incremental market share above the minimum threshold applicable to such company 
we believe that liggett has gained a sustainable cost advantage over its competitors as a result of the settlement 
the discount segment is a challenging marketplace  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price 
liggett s competition is now divided into two segments 
the first segment is made up of the three largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the united states  philip morris usa inc  reynolds america inc 
following the combination of rjr tobacco and brown williamson s united states tobacco business in july  and lorillard tobacco company as well as the fourth largest  commonwealth brands  inc which imperial tobacco plc acquired in 
the three largest manufacturers  while primarily premium cigarette based companies  also produce and sell discount cigarettes 
the second segment of competition is comprised of a group of smaller manufacturers and importers  most of which sell lower quality  deep discount cigarettes 
in january  vector tobacco introduced quest  its brand of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
quest brand cigarettes are currently marketed solely to permit adult smokers  who wish to continue smoking  to gradually reduce their intake of nicotine 
the products are not labeled or advertised for smoking cessation or as a safer form of smoking 
in march  vector tobacco concluded a randomized  multi center phase ii clinical trial to further evaluate quest technology as an effective alternative to conventional smoking cessation aids 
in july  we participated in an end of phase ii meeting with the food and drug administration fda where we received significant guidance and feedback from the agency with regard to further development of the quest technology 
in november  our board of directors determined to discontinue the genetics operation of our subsidiary  vector research ltd  and  not to pursue  at that time  fda approval of quest as a smoking cessation aid  due to the projected significant additional time and expense involved in seeking such approval 
in connection with this decision  we eliminated full time positions effective december  as a result of these actions  we are realizing annual cost savings in excess of  beginning in we recognized pre tax restructuring and inventory impairment charges of approximately  primarily during the fourth quarter of the restructuring charges include approximately relating to employee severance and benefit costs  for contract termination and other associated costs  approximately for asset impairment and in inventory write offs 
approximately  of these charges represented non cash items 
recent developments issuance of senior secured notes 
in august  we sold  principal amount of our senior secured notes due august  in a private offering to qualified institutional investors in accordance with rule a under the securities act 
we intend to use the net proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes which may include working capital requirements  the financing of capital expenditures  future acquisitions  the repayment or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness  payment of dividends and distributions and the repurchase of all or any part of our outstanding convertible notes

proposed and enacted excise tax increases 
congress is considering proposals to increase the federal excise tax by as much as per pack 
eleven states enacted increases to state excise taxes in further increases in states excise taxes are expected in tobacco settlement agreements 
in october  the independent auditor under the master settlement agreement notified liggett and all other participating manufacturers that their payment obligations under the master settlement agreement  dating from the agreement s execution in late  had been recalculated using net unit amounts  rather than gross unit amounts which had been used since to calculate market share and the allocation of the base amount of payments under the master settlement agreement 
the change in the method of calculation could  among other things  require additional master settlement agreement payments by liggett of approximately  plus interest  for through  require an additional payment of approximately  for and require additional amounts in future periods because the proposed change from gross to net units would serve to lower liggett s market share exemption under the master settlement agreement 
liggett has objected to this retroactive change and has disputed the change in methodology 
no amounts have been accrued or expensed in our consolidated financial statements for any potential liability relating to the gross versus net dispute 
in  the independent auditor under the master settlement agreement calculated that liggett owed  for its sales 
liggett paid  and disputed the balance  as permitted by the master settlement agreement 
liggett subsequently paid  of the disputed amount  although liggett continues to dispute that this amount is owed 
this  relates to an adjustment to its payment obligation claimed by liggett for the market share loss to non participating manufacturers  which is known as the npm adjustment 
at december   included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet was a receivable of  relating to such amount 
the remaining balance in dispute of  is comprised of  claimed for a npm adjustment and  relating to the independent auditor s retroactive change from gross to net units in calculating master settlement agreement payments  which liggett contends is improper  as discussed above

liggett and vector tobacco withheld approximately  from their april payments related to the npm adjustment and approximately  relating to the retroactive change from gross to net units 
the following amounts have not been expensed in our consolidated financial statements as they relate to liggett s and vector tobacco s claim for an npm adjustment  for   for and for in march  an economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the master settlement agreement rendered its final and non appealable decision that the master settlement agreement was a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share of participating manufacturers for the economic consulting firm rendered the same decision with respect to and as a result  the manufacturers are entitled to potential npm adjustments to their  and master settlement agreement payments 
a settling state that has diligently enforced its qualifying escrow statute in the year in question may be able to avoid application of the npm adjustment to the payments made by the manufacturers for the benefit of that state or territory 
since april  notwithstanding provisions in the master settlement agreement requiring arbitration  litigation has been commenced in settling states and territories over the issue of whether the application of the npm adjustment for is to be determined through litigation or arbitration 
these actions relate to the potential npm adjustment for  which the independent auditor under the master settlement agreement previously 
table of contents determined to be as much as  for all participating manufacturers 
to date  of courts that have decided the issue have ruled that the npm adjustment dispute is arbitrable and of these decisions are final 
in louisiana  participating manufacturers have appealed the court s decision that the dispute was not arbitrable 
there can be no assurance that liggett or vector tobacco will receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings 
in  in order to resolve any potential issues with minnesota as to liggett s ongoing economic settlement obligations  liggett negotiated a a year payment to minnesota  to be paid any year cigarettes manufactured by liggett are sold in that state 
in  the attorneys general for each of florida  mississippi and texas advised liggett that they believed that liggett has failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states for the period through and that additional payments may be due for and subsequent years 
liggett believes these allegations are without merit  based  among other things  on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements

recent developments in tobacco related litigation the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of february   there were approximately  individual suits excluding approximately individual cases pending in west virginia state court as part of a consolidated action  liggett has been severed from the trial of the consolidated action  purported class actions and four governmental and other third party payor health care reimbursement actions pending in the united states in which liggett or us  or both  were named as a defendant 
a civil lawsuit was filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately  from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
in august  the trial court entered a final judgment and remedial order against each of the cigarette manufacturing defendants  except liggett 
the final judgment  among other things  ordered the following relief against the non liggett defendants i the 
table of contents defendants are enjoined from committing any act of racketeering concerning the manufacturing  marketing  promotion  health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states  ii the defendants are enjoined from making any material false  misleading  or deceptive statement or representation concerning cigarettes that persuades people to purchase cigarettes  iii the defendants are permanently enjoined from utilizing lights  low tar  ultra lights  mild  or natural descriptors  or conveying any other express or implied health messages in connection with the marketing or sale of cigarettes as of january   iv the defendants must make corrective statements on their websites  and in television and print media advertisements  v the defendants must maintain internet document websites until with access to smoking and health related documents  vi the defendants must disclose all disaggregated marketing data to the government on a confidential basis  vii the defendants are not permitted to sell or otherwise transfer any of their cigarette brands  product formulas or businesses to any person or entity for domestic use without a court order  and unless the acquiring person or entity will be bound by the terms of the final judgment  and viii the defendants must pay the appropriate costs of the government in prosecuting the action  in an amount to be determined by the trial court 
no monetary damages were awarded other than the government s costs 
in october  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the final judgment pending appeal 
the defendants filed amended notices of appeal in march the government acknowledged in its appellate brief that it was not appealing the district court s decision to award no remedy against liggett 
therefore  although this case has been concluded as to liggett  it is unclear what impact  if any  the final judgment will have on the cigarette industry as a whole 
to the extent that the final judgment leads to a decline in industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states or otherwise imposes regulations which adversely affect the industry  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
class action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers  alleging  among other things  that the use of the terms light and ultralight constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices 
one such suit schwab v 
philip morris  pending in federal court in new york since  seeks to create a nationwide class of light cigarette smokers and includes liggett as a defendant 
the action asserts claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
the proposed class is seeking as much as  in damages  which could be trebled under rico 
in november  the court ruled that the plaintiffs would be permitted to calculate damages on an aggregate basis and use fluid recovery theories to allocate them among class members  if the class is certified 
fluid recovery would permit potential damages to be paid out in ways other than merely giving cash directly to plaintiffs  such as establishing a pool of money that could be used for public purposes 
in september  the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification 
in november  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit granted the defendants motions to stay the district court proceedings and for review of the class certification ruling 
oral argument was held in july and the parties are awaiting a decision 
liggett is a defendant in the schwab case 
there are currently three individual tobacco related actions pending where liggett is the only tobacco company defendant 
in april  in one of these cases  a jury in a florida state court action awarded compensatory damages of against liggett 
in addition  plaintiff s counsel was awarded legal fees of liggett has appealed both the verdict and the legal fees award 
in october  the fourth district court of appeals affirmed the compensatory award 
liggett filed a motion for rehearing and or certification which is currently pending before the appellate court 
in march  in another case in florida state court in which liggett is the only defendant  the court granted liggett s motion for summary judgment 
the plaintiff appealed and  in june  a florida intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the case back to the trial court 
the court granted leave to plaintiff to add a claim for punitive damages 
trial commenced on february  and on february  the court declared a mistrial 
in may  florida s third district court of appeal reversed a  punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle smoking and health class action 
in july  the florida supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part the may intermediate appellate court decision 
among other things  the florida supreme court affirmed the decision vacating the punitive damages award and held that the claim should be decertified prospectively  but preserved several of the phase i findings including that i smoking causes lung cancer  among other diseases  ii nicotine in cigarettes is addictive  iii defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous  iv the defendants concealed material information  v all 
table of contents defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective  and vi all defendants were negligent and allowed plaintiffs to proceed to trial on individual liability issues using the above findings and compensatory and punitive damage issues  provided they commence their individual lawsuits within one year of the date the court s decision became final on january   the date of the court s mandate 
in december  the florida supreme court added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that  at the time of sale or supply  did not conform to the representations made by defendants 
class counsel filed motions for attorneys fees and costs  which motions are pending 
in may  the defendants  including liggett  filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court 
the petition was denied in september in october  defendants filed a petition for rehearing before the united states supreme court which was denied in november as of february   there were approximately  engle progeny cases filed and served  in state and federal courts in florida  where either liggett and other cigarette manufacturers or us  or both  were named as defendants 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs 
plaintiffs have days from the filing date to serve their complaints  so the total number of engle progeny cases may increase substantially 
in june  the jury in lukacs v 
r 
j 
reynolds tobacco company  an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case  awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other cigarette manufacturers and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the plaintiff has recently moved for the trial court to enter final judgment in this matter and to tax costs and attorneys fees and schedule trial on the punitive damages claims 
liggett may be required to bond the amount of the judgment against it to perfect its appeal 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
we cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
in recent years  there have been a number of proposed restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the fda 
there have also been adverse political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry  including the commencement and certification of class actions and the commencement of third party payor actions 
recently  legislation was reintroduced in congress providing for the regulation of cigarettes by the fda 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco related litigation 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include restructuring and impairment charges  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  promotional accruals  sales returns and allowances  actuarial assumptions of pension plans  the estimated fair value of embedded derivative liabilities  the tobacco quota buyout  settlement accruals and litigation and defense costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

during the fourth quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas r  share based payment  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income tax effects of issuing convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature were adopted on january  there were no other accounting policies adopted during  and that had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
refer to note w of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of cigarettes are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price 
table of contents is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide an allowance for expected sales returns  net of any related inventory cost recoveries 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  our accounting policy is to include federal excise taxes in revenues and cost of goods sold 
such revenues and cost of sales totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since our primary line of business is tobacco  our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by significant unit sales volume declines  litigation and defense costs  increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term 
marketing costs 
we record marketing costs as an expense in the period to which such costs relate 
we do not defer the recognition of any amounts on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to marketing costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred  which is the period in which the related advertisement initially appears 
we record consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as a reduction in revenue in the period in which these programs are offered  based on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we have recorded charges related to employee severance and benefits  asset impairments  contract termination and other associated exit costs during  and the calculation of severance pay requires management to identify employees to be terminated and the timing of their severance from employment 
the calculation of benefits charges requires actuarial assumptions including determination of discount rates 
as discussed further below  the asset impairments were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires management to estimate the fair value of assets to be disposed of 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
charges related to restructuring activities initiated after this date were recorded when incurred 
prior to this date  charges were recorded at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these restructuring charges are based on management s best estimate at the time of restructuring 
the status of the restructuring activities is reviewed on a quarterly basis and any adjustments to the reserve  which could differ materially from previous estimates  are recorded as an adjustment to operating income 
contingencies 
we record liggett s product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs as operating  selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and above under the heading recent developments in tobacco related litigation  legal proceedings are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against liggett 
a large number of individual product liability cases have been filed in state and federal courts in florida as a result of the florida supreme court s decision in the engle case 
management is unable to make a reasonable estimate with respect to the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobacco related litigation or the costs of defending such cases  and we have not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
you should not infer from the absence of any such reserve in our consolidated financial statements that liggett will not be subject to significant tobacco related liabilities in the future 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation 
settlement agreements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  liggett and vector tobacco are participants in the master settlement agreement  the agreement to settle governmental healthcare cost recovery actions brought by various states 
liggett and vector tobacco have no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement except to the extent their market shares exceed approximately and  respectively  of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
their obligations  and the related expense charges under the master settlement agreement  are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by liggett and vector tobacco  their relative market shares and inflation 
since relative market shares are based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under the master settlement agreement is recorded in cost of goods sold as the products are shipped 
settlement expenses under the master settlement agreement recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were  for  
table of contents  for and  for adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
derivatives  beneficial conversion feature 
we measure all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  at fair value and recognize them in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on our rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
in  and  we issued variable interest senior convertible debt in a series of private placements where a portion of the total interest payable on the debt is computed by reference to the cash dividends paid on our common stock 
this portion of the interest payment is considered an embedded derivative within the convertible debt  which we are required to separately value 
as a result  we have bifurcated this embedded derivative and  based on a valuation by a third party  estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative liability 
the resulting discount created by allocating a portion of the issuance proceeds to the embedded derivative is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method 
at december  and  the fair value of derivative liabilities was estimated at  and  respectively 
changes to the fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations as changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt 
we recognized a loss of  in and gains of and  in and  respectively  due to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative  which were reported as changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
after giving effect to the recording of embedded derivative liabilities as a discount to the convertible debt  our common stock had a fair value at the issuance date of the notes in excess of the conversion price  resulting in a beneficial conversion feature 
the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as additional paid in capital and as a discount on the debt 
the discount is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method 
we recognized non cash interest expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the embedded derivatives and   and  in  and  respectively  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature 
inventories 
tobacco inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined primarily by the last in  first out lifo method at liggett and the first in  first out fifo method at vector tobacco 
although portions of leaf tobacco inventories may not be used or sold within one year because of time required for aging  they are included in current assets  which is common practice in the industry 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
stock based compensation 
in january  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  under which share based transactions are accounted for using a fair value based method to recognize non cash compensation expense 
prior to adoption  our stock based compensation plans were accounted for in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees with the intrinsic value based method permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january  and prior to  but not yet vested as of january  in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
upon adoption  there was no cumulative adjustment for the impact of the change in accounting principles because the assumed forfeiture rate did not differ significantly from prior periods 
we recognized compensation expense of and for the year ended december and  respectively  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
in addition  effective january   as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  payments 
table of contents of dividend equivalent rights on the unexercised portion of stock options are accounted for as reductions in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prior to january   in accordance with apb opinion no 
 we accounted for these dividend equivalent rights as additional compensation expense  net of taxes  for the year ended december  
as of december   there was of total unrecognized cost related to employee stock options 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the adoption of this standard 
employee benefit plans 
the determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
we determine discount rates by using a quantitative analysis that considers the prevailing prices of investment grade bonds and the anticipated cash flow from our two qualified defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical and life insurance plans 
these analyses construct a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the annual projected cash flows from our pension and retiree health plans 
as of september   our benefit obligations and service cost were computed assuming a discount rate of and  respectively 
in determining our expected rate of return on plan assets we consider input from our external advisors and historical returns based on the expected long term rate of return is the weighted average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class 
our actual year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in computing expense for the year ended december   we will use an assumption of a annual rate of return on our pension plan assets 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense 
net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit expense aggregated approximately  for  and we currently anticipate such expense will be approximately  for in contrast  our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
to comply with erisa s minimum funding requirements  we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on january  and ending on december  any additional funding obligation that we may have for subsequent years is contingent on several factors and is not reasonably estimable at this time 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of their benefit plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of other comprehensive income 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and its benefit obligation 
in addition  sfas no 
requires an employer to measure benefit plan assets and obligations that determine the funded status of a plan as of the end of its fiscal year 
we presently measure the funded status of its plans at september and the new measurement date requirements become effective for us on december  the prospective requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and to provide the required disclosures became effective for us on december  income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time and  as a result  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments may materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our adoption of fin on january  and our uncertain tax positions

total revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this  increase in revenues was due to a  increase in revenues at liggett offset by a decrease of  in revenues at vector tobacco 
tobacco revenues 
in september  liggett generally reduced its promotional pricing on liggett select and eve by per carton and increased the list price of grand prix by per carton 
in april  liggett increased the list price of grand prix by an additional per carton

industry shipment volume is a major component of liggett s expense under the master settlement agreement because liggett is exempt from payments under the master settlement agreement unless its market share exceeds approximately and vector tobacco s market share exceeds of the us cigarette market 
in  industry shipment volume remained flat compared to shipment volume for due to increased industry inventory levels  which we believe occurred because in anticipation of an increase in the master settlement agreement rates in as a result  our expense under the master settlement agreement decreased by approximately  in as compared to the normal annual decline in industry volume 
liggett s gross profit of  for the year ended december  increased  from gross profit of  for the year ended december  as a percent of revenues excluding federal excise taxes  gross profit at liggett decreased to in compared to in this decrease in liggett s gross profit percentage in the period was attributable to higher master settlement agreement expenses in due to increased units exceeding liggett s market share exemption

expenses at liggett were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  or

expenses at corporate for the year ended december  were  compared to  in  with the primary reduction in expenses resulting primarily from the recovery of insurance coverage relating to settlement costs and expenses associated with previous stockholder litigation 
in august  new valley received a favorable arbitral award in connection with a dispute with its insurer over reimbursement of legal fees paid in a previously resolved stockholders derivative claim 
new valley and its insurer agreed to resolve this claim  and certain other claims  for the payment to new valley of  this settlement resulted in the recognition of a gain in of approximately  net of legal fees  which has been recorded as a reduction in operating  selling  administrative and general expenses

the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt  our stock price as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt 
the loss from the embedded derivative for year ended december  was primarily the result of decreasing long term interest rates as compared to december  offset by the payment of interest during the period  which reduced the fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the gain from the embedded derivative in the year ended december  was primarily the result of interest payments and higher long term interest rates in as compared to december  this was offset by declining long term interest rates since the issuance of our convertible debentures on july  income before income taxes

liggett 
liggett has a  credit facility with wachovia bank  na under which  was outstanding at december  availability as determined under the facility was approximately  based on eligible collateral at december  the facility is collateralized by all inventories and receivables of liggett and a mortgage on its manufacturing facility 
the facility requires liggett s compliance with certain financial and other covenants including a restriction on liggett s ability to pay cash dividends unless liggett s borrowing availability under the facility for the day period prior to the payment of the dividend  and after giving effect to the dividend  is at least  and no event of default has occurred under the agreement  including liggett s compliance with the covenants in the credit facility 

table of contents the term of the wachovia facility expires on march   subject to automatic renewal for additional one year periods unless a notice of termination is given by wachovia or liggett at least days prior to such date or the anniversary of such date 
prime rate loans under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to the prime rate of wachovia with eurodollar rate loans bearing interest at a rate of above wachovia s adjusted eurodollar rate 
the facility contains covenants that provide that liggett s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined under the facility  on a trailing twelve month basis  shall not be less than  if liggett s excess availability  as defined  under the facility is less than  the covenants also require that annual capital expenditures  as defined under the facility  before a maximum carryover amount of  shall not exceed  during any fiscal year 
at december   management believed that liggett was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility  liggett s ebitda  as defined  were approximately  for the twelve months ended december  in august  wachovia made an  term loan to maple llc  a subsidiary of liggett  within the commitment under the existing credit facility 
the  term loan is collateralized by the existing collateral securing the credit facility  and is also collateralized by a lien on certain real property in mebane  nc owned by maple llc 
the mebane property also secures the other obligations of liggett under the credit facility 
the  term loan did not increase the  borrowing amount of the credit facility  but did increase the outstanding amounts under the credit facility by the amount of the term loan and proportionately reduces the maximum borrowing availability under the facility 
in august  liggett and wachovia amended the credit facility to permit the guaranty of the senior secured notes by each of liggett and maple and the pledging of certain assets of liggett and maple on a subordinated basis to secure their guarantees 
the credit facility was also amended to grant to wachovia a blanket lien on all the assets of liggett and maple  excluding any equipment pledged to current or future purchase money or other financiers of such equipment and excluding any real property  other than the mebane property and other real property to the extent its value is in excess of  in connection with the amendment  wachovia  liggett  maple and the collateral agent for the holders of our senior secured notes entered into an intercreditor agreement  pursuant to which the liens of the collateral agent on the liggett and maple assets will be subordinated to the liens of wachovia on the liggett and maple assets

table of contents liggett and other united states cigarette manufacturers have been named as defendants in a number of direct  third party and purported class actions predicated on the theory that they should be liable for damages alleged to have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to secondary smoke from cigarettes 
we believe  and have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that liggett has a number of valid defenses to claims asserted against it  however  litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
plaintiff has recently moved the court to enter final judgment and to tax costs and attorneys fees and schedule trial on the punitive damages claims 
liggett may be required to bond the amount of the judgment against it to perfect its appeal 
in april  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages of against liggett in an individual action 
in addition  plaintiff s counsel was awarded legal fees of liggett has appealed the verdict 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably 
as of february   there were approximately  engle progeny cases filed and served  in state and federal courts in florida  where either liggett and other cigarette manufacturers or us  or both  were named as defendants 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs 
plaintiffs have days from the filing date to serve their complaints  so the total number of engle progeny cases may increase substantially 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
an unfavorable outcome of a pending smoking and health case could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
in recent years  there have been a number of adverse regulatory  political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
neither we nor liggett are able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation or regulation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and legislation and regulation below for a description of legislation  regulation and litigation 
management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against liggett or the costs of defending such cases 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation

in such transaction  philip morris acquired an option to purchase the remaining interest in trademarks for a day period commencing in december  and we have an option to require philip morris to purchase the remaining interest for a day period commencing in march we deferred for income tax purposes  a portion of the gain on the transaction until such time as the options were exercised

off balance sheet arrangements we have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights 
payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount  and in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement

in may  in connection with the philip morris brand transaction  eve holdings inc  a subsidiary of liggett  guaranteed a  bank loan to trademarks llc

the license provides for a minimum annual royalty payment equal to the annual debt service on the loan plus  trademarks future royalties have been guaranteed by altria group inc  the parent of philip morris 
as a result of altria group inc s investment grade debt rating  we believe that no premium would be required by eve to issue the same guarantee in a standalone arm s length transaction and the fair value of eve s guarantee was negligible at december  in february  liggett vector brands and another cigarette manufacturer entered into a five year agreement with a subsidiary of the american wholesale marketers association to support a program to permit tobacco distributors to secure  on reasonable terms  tax stamp bonds required by state and local governments for the distribution of cigarettes

to secure its potential obligations under the agreement  liggett vector brands has delivered to the subsidiary of the association a letter of credit and agreed to fund up to an additional liggett vector brands has incurred no losses to date under this agreement  and we believe the fair value of liggett vector brands obligation under the agreement was immaterial at december  at december   we had outstanding approximately  of letters of credit  collateralized by certificates of deposit

our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our variable rate borrowings  which could adversely affect our cash flows 
as of december   we had no interest rate caps or swaps 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately in addition  as of december   approximately   principal amount of outstanding debt had a variable interest rate determined by the amount of the dividends on our common stock 
included in the difference between the stated value of the debt and carrying value are embedded derivatives  which were estimated at  at december  changes to the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected quarterly within our statements of operations as changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt and changes in the closing stock price at the end of each quarterly period 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt could increase or decrease by approximately  with approximately resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our variable interest senior convertible notes due and the remaining  resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our variable interest senior convertible debentures due an increase in our quarterly dividend rate by per share would increase interest expense by approximately  per year

new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments 
sfas no 
amends sfas nos 
and and relates to the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments 
sfas no 
allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of fiscal years commencing after september  we did not elect to retroactively apply sfas no 
and  as a result  it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier adoption encouraged 
this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the adoption of fin is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value should be based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy of three levels that prioritizes the information used 
table of contents to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
sfas no 
requires fair value measurements to be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas no 
will become effective for us beginning january  generally  the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively 
certain situations  however  require retrospective application as of the beginning of the year of adoption through the recognition of a cumulative effect of accounting change 
such retrospective application is required for financial instruments  including derivatives and certain hybrid instruments with limitations on initial gains or losses under eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
in february  the fasb staff issued a staff position that will partially defer the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas no 
we have not completed our assessment of the impact of this standard 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  a revised version of sfas no

the revision is intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with international accounting rules 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply it before that date

legislation and regulation reports with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and  in the opinion of liggett s management  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on cigarette sales 
since  the surgeon general of the united states and the secretary of health and human services have released a number of reports which state that cigarette smoking is a causative factor with respect to a variety of health hazards  including cancer  heart disease and lung disease  and have recommended various government actions to reduce the incidence of smoking 
in  liggett publicly acknowledged that  as the surgeon general and respected medical researchers have found  smoking causes health problems  including lung cancer  heart and vascular disease  and emphysema 
since  federal law has required that cigarettes manufactured  packaged or imported for sale or distribution in the united states include specific health warnings on their packaging 
since  liggett and the other cigarette manufacturers have included the federally required warning statements in print advertising and on certain categories of point of sale display materials relating to cigarettes 
the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act fcla act requires that packages of cigarettes distributed in the united states and cigarette advertisements in the united states bear one of the following four warning statements surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy  surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health  surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight  and surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
the law also requires that each person who manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
annual reports to the united states congress are also required from the secretary of health and human services as to current information on the health consequences of smoking and from the federal trade commission ftc on the effectiveness of cigarette labeling and current practices and methods of cigarette advertising and promotion 
both federal agencies are also required annually to make such recommendations as they deem 
table of contents appropriate with regard to further legislation 
it is possible that proposed legislation providing for regulation of cigarettes by the food and drug administration fda  if enacted  could significantly change the warning requirements currently mandated by the fcla act 
in addition  since  liggett has included the warning smoking is addictive on its cigarette packages 
in january  the environmental protection agency epa released a report on the respiratory effect of secondary smoke which concludes that secondary smoke is a known human lung carcinogen in adults and in children  causes increased respiratory tract disease and middle ear disorders and increases the severity and frequency of asthma 
in june  the two largest of the major domestic cigarette manufacturers  together with other segments of the tobacco and distribution industries  commenced a lawsuit against the epa seeking a determination that the epa did not have the statutory authority to regulate secondary smoke  and that given the scientific evidence and the epa s failure to follow its own guidelines in making the determination  the epa s classification of secondary smoke was arbitrary and capricious 
in july  a federal district court vacated those sections of the report relating to lung cancer  finding that the epa may have reached different conclusions had it complied with relevant statutory requirements 
the federal government appealed the court s ruling 
in december  the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit rejected the industry challenge to the epa report ruling that it was not subject to court review 
issuance of the report may encourage efforts to limit smoking in public areas 
in august  the fda filed in the federal register a final rule classifying tobacco as a drug or medical device  asserting jurisdiction over the manufacture and marketing of tobacco products and imposing restrictions on the sale  advertising and promotion of tobacco products 
litigation was commenced challenging the legal authority of the fda to assert such jurisdiction  as well as challenging the constitutionality of the rule 
in march  the united states supreme court ruled that the fda does not have the power to regulate tobacco 
liggett supported the fda rule and began to phase in compliance with certain of the proposed fda regulations 
since the supreme court decision  various proposals and recommendations have been made for additional federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers 
congressional advocates of fda regulations have introduced legislation that would give the fda authority to regulate the manufacture  sale  distribution and labeling of tobacco products to protect public health  thereby allowing the fda to reinstate its prior regulations or adopt new or additional regulations 
in october  the senate passed a bill  which did not become law  providing for fda regulation of tobacco products 
a substantially similar bill was reintroduced in congress in february the ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be predicted  but fda regulation of tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on us 
in august  massachusetts enacted legislation requiring tobacco companies to publish information regarding the ingredients in cigarettes and other tobacco products sold in that state 
in december  the united states court of appeals for the first circuit ruled that the ingredients disclosure provisions violated the constitutional prohibition against unlawful seizure of property by forcing firms to reveal trade secrets 
liggett began voluntarily complying with this legislation in december by providing ingredient information to the massachusetts department of public health and  notwithstanding the appellate court s ruling  has continued to provide ingredient disclosure 
liggett and vector tobacco also provide ingredient information annually  as required by law  to the states of texas and minnesota 
several other states are considering ingredient disclosure legislation  and the senate bill providing for fda regulation also calls for  among other things  ingredient disclosure 
in october  the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of fetra was signed into law 
fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders 
pursuant to the legislation  manufacturers of tobacco products will be assessed  over a ten year period to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights 
cigarette manufacturers will initially be responsible for of the assessment subject to adjustment in the future  which will be allocated based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
liggett s and vector tobacco s assessment was million in  million in and million in the relative cost of the legislation to the three largest cigarette manufacturers will likely be less than the cost to smaller manufacturers  including liggett and vector tobacco  because one effect of the legislation is that the three largest manufacturers will no longer be obligated to make certain contractual payments  commonly known as phase ii payments  that they agreed in to make to tobacco producing states 
the ultimate impact of this 
table of contents legislation cannot be determined  but there is a risk that smaller manufacturers  such as liggett and vector tobacco  will be disproportionately affected by the legislation  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal  state and local excise taxes 
the federal excise tax on cigarettes is currently per pack 
state and local sales and excise taxes vary considerably and  when combined with sales taxes  local taxes and the current federal excise tax  may currently exceed per pack 
in  states enacted increases in excise taxes 
further increases in state excise taxes are expected in congress is currently considering significant increases in the federal excise tax or other payments from tobacco manufacturers  and various states and other jurisdictions are considering  or have pending  legislation proposing further state excise tax increases 
management believes increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes 
in june  the new york state legislature passed legislation charging the state s office of fire prevention and control with developing standards for self extinguishing or reduced ignition propensity cigarettes 
all cigarettes manufactured for sale in new york state must be manufactured to specific reduced ignition propensity standards set forth in the regulations 
since the passage of the new york law  approximately states have passed similar laws utilizing substantially similar technical standards 
similar legislation is being considered by other state governments and at the federal level 
compliance with such legislation could harm the business of liggett and vector tobacco  particularly if there were to be varying standards from state to state 
federal or state regulators may object to vector tobacco s low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products and reduced risk cigarette products it may develop as unlawful or allege they bear deceptive or unsubstantiated product claims  and seek the removal of the products from the marketplace or significant changes to advertising 
allegations by federal or state regulators  public health organizations and other tobacco manufacturers that vector tobacco s products are unlawful  or that its public statements or advertising contain misleading or unsubstantiated health claims or product comparisons  may result in litigation or governmental proceedings 
vector tobacco s business may become subject to extensive domestic and international governmental regulation 
various proposals have been made for federal  state and international legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers generally  and reduced constituent cigarettes specifically 
it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues like the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising and labeling of tobacco products as well as any express or implied health claims associated with reduced risk  low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
a system of regulation by agencies such as the fda  the ftc or the united states department of agriculture may be established 
the ftc has expressed interest in the regulation of tobacco products which bear reduced carcinogen claims 
the ultimate outcome of any of the foregoing cannot be predicted  but any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes  and these laws have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
there are various other legislative efforts pending on the federal and state level which seek to  among other things  eliminate smoking in public places  further restrict displays and advertising of cigarettes  require additional warnings  including graphic warnings  on cigarette packaging and advertising  ban vending machine sales and curtail affirmative defenses of tobacco companies in product liability litigation 
this trend has had  and is likely to continue to have  an adverse effect on us 
in addition to the foregoing  there have been a number of other restrictive regulatory actions  adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry  possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation  and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation
