usse conducts business primarily in central  western and southern europe and ussc conducts business primarily in canada 
they are subject to market conditions in those areas which are influenced by many of the same factors that affect us markets  as well as matters specific to international markets such as quotas and tariffs 
they are affected by worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry  the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions 
in particular  usse and ussc are subject to economic conditions  environmental regulations and political factors in europe and canada  respectively  which if changed could negatively affect results of operations and cash flow 
these economic conditions  environmental regulations and political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  currency fluctuations  increased regulation  limits on emissions see environmental matters for discussions regarding carbon dioxide emissions limits which are applicable to european union member countries  and carbon dioxide emissions limitations which are expected to come into effect in canada  limits on production  and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures

while the majority of ussc s costs are in canadian dollars  there are significant raw material purchases that are in us dollars 
in addition  the stelco acquisition was funded from the united states and through the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings from usse  creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in different functional currencies  which can impact income when they are remeasured at the end of each quarter

table of contents raw materials and energy historically  supplies of raw materials and energy used to produce steel have been more than sufficient and costs were relatively stable 
in the past several years there has been a tightening of raw material availability and a substantial increase in costs 
as an integrated producer  u 
s 
steel s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore or taconite  carbon units in the form of coal and coke which is produced from coal and steel scrap 
the amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products  the quality of raw materials and  to a lesser extent  differences among steel producing equipment 
in broad terms  u 
s 
steel estimates that it consumes about tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and that it consumes over tons of iron ore pellets and a little less than tons of coke for each ton of raw steel produced 
while we believe that these estimates are useful for planning purposes  substantial variations occur 
they are presented in order to give a general sense of raw material consumption related to steel production 
iron ore logo the iron ore facilities at minntac and keetac contain an estimated million short tons of recoverable reserves 
recoverable tons means the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses 
u 
s 
steel also receives iron ore pellets from the hibbing  tilden and wabush joint ventures 
at high levels of steelmaking production  we could be one to two million tons short of our north american requirements 
the anticipated shortfall  plus any additional shortfall upon the completion of the sale of our equity interest in wabush  will be purchased 
we announced a capital investment program in excess of million at keetac to increase production by modernizing and improving a pellet indurating line that has been idle since once this expansion begins production  we will return to a position of being able to fully satisfy our north american pellet requirements

at usse  we expect to utilize approximately  mmbtu s of natural gas in  all of which is purchased from third parties 
we believe that supplies adequate to meet usse s needs are normally available at competitive market prices 
natural gas prices in slovakia and serbia have been less volatile than in the united states  however  prices have increased over the last several years 
we experienced curtailments of natural gas supplies at usss in early serbia relies upon a single pipeline system for its natural gas  making usss and other industrial customers in serbia exposed to disruptions in this system 
in both north america and europe  we use self generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to mitigate our natural gas usage

the environmental affairs organization has the responsibility to ensure that u 
s 
steel s operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
the executive environmental committee  which is comprised of officers of u 
s 
steel  is charged with reviewing our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs 
also  u 
s 
steel  largely through the american iron and steel institute  the canadian steel producers association  the international iron and steel institute and eurofer  is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air  water  waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local  state  national and international levels 
u 
s 
steel s businesses in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource 
table of contents conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments 
federal environmental statutes include the federal canadian environmental protection act  and the fisheries act 
various provincial statutes regulate environmental matters such as the release and remediation of hazardous substances  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and air emissions 
as in the united states  canadian environmental laws federal  provincial and local are undergoing revisions and becoming more stringent 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the european union eu 
there are no legal proceedings pending against ussk involving environmental matters 
ussk had a compliance project for a primary dedusting system at steel shop no 
to meet air emission standards for particulates  and met the compliance standards prior to the deadline established by the slovak government 
usss is subject to the environmental laws of serbia 
under the terms of the acquisition  usss will be responsible for only those costs and liabilities associated with environmental events occurring subsequent to the completion of an environmental baseline study 
the study was completed in june and submitted to the government of serbia 
there are no legal proceedings pending against usss involving environmental matters 
to comply with the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  the european commission ec establishes its own co 

limits for every eu member state 
in  the ec approved a national allocation plan nap i for slovakia that reduced slovakia s originally proposed co allocation by approximately percent  and following that decision the slovak ministry of the environment ministry imposed an percent reduction to the amount of co allowances originally requested by ussk 
subsequently  ussk filed legal actions against the ec and the ministry challenging these reductions 
the challenge against the ec has been dismissed on grounds of inadmissibility 
on november   the ec issued a decision that slovakia would be granted percent fewer co allowances than were requested in slovakia s nap ii  for the allocation period through the ministry has not yet made an allocation of slovakia s co allowances to companies within slovakia for the nap ii period  but has submitted to the ec a revised allocation plan that would award ussk more annual allowances than were awarded to ussk under the slovak nap i plan 
slovakia has withdrawn its legal challenge against the ec regarding nap ii  and the challenge by ussk is on appeal  after having been dismissed at the lower court on grounds of inadmissibility 
the potential financial and or operational impacts of nap ii are not currently determinable 
although ratification of the kyoto protocol in the united states has not occurred  there remains the possibility that limitations on greenhouse gases may be imposed 
since the united states supreme court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the clean air act in massachusetts v 
epa  there is a growing consensus that some form of federal regulation regarding carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is forthcoming in the united states 
however  the timing and specific requirements regarding greenhouse gases are not currently known  therefore  the impact on our domestic operations cannot be estimated at this time 
on april   canada s federal government announced an action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution 
the federal government plans to set mandatory reduction targets on all major greenhouse gas producing industries to achieve an absolute reduction of megatonnes in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by facilities existing in will be required to cut their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by percent by  with a further percent reduction in each following year 
implementing regulations are expected to be issued for public comment in the spring of companies will be able to choose the most cost effective way to meet their targets from a range of options 
environment canada has indicated that the proposed rules will contain 
table of contents exemptions for fixed process gas emissions industries  including steel  for which an exemption of percent of greenhouse gas emissions is contemplated 
certain provinces have enacted climate change rules and ontario may also do so 
the impact on ussc cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers particularly in developing economies such as china and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s

the principal impact of the caa on u 
s 
steel is on the cokemaking and primary steelmaking operations  as described in this section 
the caa requires  among other things  the regulation of hazardous air pollutants and development and promulgation of maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
as a result  the us environmental protection agency epa has developed various industry specific mact standards 
those affecting u 
s 
steel operations in the greatest magnitude include the mact standards that are specific to cokemaking  ironmaking  steelmaking  and iron ore processing 
the applicable mact standards for some of u 
s 
steel s coke facilities are expected to be adopted in because the scope of these anticipated changes are distant and unknown  the magnitude of the impact of these anticipated changes cannot be estimated at this time 
the caa also requires epa to develop and implement national ambient air quality standards naaqs for criteria pollutants  which include  among others  particulate matter and ozone 
in  epa established hour and annual standards for fine particles that are less than micrometers in size pm  and in  epa tightened the hour standard for pm  but retained the annual standard 
it is anticipated that epa s fine particle programs could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel  however  it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of these costs at this time as state and federal agencies are still developing regulations for the programs and implementation is not expected until between standard and standard 
in june  epa proposed to modify the naaqs for ground level ozone which could affect sources of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds  which include iron and steel facilities 
it is anticipated that the ozone naaqs revisions could result in significant cost to u

risk factors risk factors concerning the steel industry steel consumption is cyclical and worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry and the availability of alternative products have resulted in intense competition  which may have an adverse effect on profitability and cash flow 
steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows general economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets 
the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess world supply  which has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness 
future economic downturns could decrease the demand for our products 
substitute materials are increasingly available for many steel products  which further reduces demand for steel 
rapidly growing supply in china and other developing economies  which may increase faster than increases in demand  may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years  steel consumption in china and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by developing plans to rapidly increase steel production capability in these countries 
steel production  especially in china  has been expanding rapidly and appears to be well in excess of 
table of contents chinese demand 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any significant excess chinese capacity could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if this excess and subsidized production is exported to other markets 
increased imports of steel products into north america and europe could negatively affect steel prices and demand levels and reduce our profitability 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the domestic steel market in  percent in and percent in foreign competitors may have lower labor costs  and some are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
the recent expiration of a number of antidumping and countervailing duty orders may facilitate additional imports 
steel imports to canada have accounted for over half of the canadian market for flat rolled steel products since  representing percent of the flat rolled steel market in the first nine months of  percent in and percent in the flat rolled steel market in europe has become extremely attractive for imports in the last two years 
total imports of flat rolled carbon steel products to the eu rose by percent in compared to  and by percent in compared to imports of galvanized sheets to the eu increased by percent in compared to  while imports of galvanized sheets from china to the eu increased by percent during the same period 
increases in future levels of imported steel to north america and europe could reduce future market prices and demand levels for steel products in those markets 
imports into the united states  canada and the european union have often violated the international trade laws of these jurisdictions 
while in some cases u 
s 
steel and others have been successful in obtaining relief under these laws  in other circumstances relief has not been received 
when received  such relief is generally subject to automatic or discretionary recision or reduction 
there can be no assurance that any such relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief as may be obtained will be adequate 
increases in prices and limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
steel producers require large amounts of raw materials iron ore or other iron containing material  steel scrap  coke  coal  zinc  tin and other metallic additions for integrated producers such as u 
s 
steel  and scrap  zinc and other metallic additions for mini mill producers 
both integrated and mini mill producers consume large amounts of energy 
over the last several years  prices for raw materials and energy have increased significantly 
in many cases these price increases have been a greater percentage than price increases for the sale of steel products 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to shortages or transportation problems such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes  resulting in production curtailments 
usss is dependent upon availability of natural gas in serbia  which is dependent upon a single pipeline 
serbia has experienced major curtailments during periods of peak demand in eastern europe and russia 
these production curtailments and escalated costs have reduced profit margins and may do so in the future 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
steel producers in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the clean air act  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 

table of contents international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the european union  canada and japan are generally comparable to us standards  other nations have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations many lawsuits have been filed against u 
s 
steel involving asbestos related injuries  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is a defendant in a large number of cases in which approximately  claimants actively allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
it is possible that we may experience large judgments against us in the future that could have an impact upon the number of future claims filed against us and on the amount of future settlements  which would have an adverse impact on our profitability and cash flow 
our retiree employee health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  and our pension plan costs in north america are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we maintain defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering most of our north american employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current employees  retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and or medical benefits 
u 
s 
steel s benefit obligations for retiree medical and life insurance other benefits exceeded trust assets by billion at year end of this underfunding  billion was assumed with the stelco acquisition 
most of our other benefits and pension benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
minimum contributions to the main qualified pension plan are controlled under erisa and other government regulations 
in connection with the stelco acquisition  u 
s 
steel guaranteed stelco s pension funding obligations under an agreement entered into by stelco and the province of ontario 
in  contributions totaling million will be required under this agreement 
the net underfunded status of our canadian defined benefit pension plans at december  was million 
substantial cash contributions will be required to fund other benefits and pension benefits 
total costs for pension plans and other benefits are expected to be approximately million in many domestic and international competitors do not provide defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and pension plans  and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
several domestic competitors provide defined contribution health care and pension plans with contributions increased based upon profitability 
this will provide these competitors with a significant competitive advantage during periods of low profits 
u 
s 
steel contributes to a multiemployer plan in the united states covering pensions for usw represented workers formerly employed by national steel and workers hired after may we have legal and contractual requirements for future funding of this plan  which will have a negative effect on our cash flows 
in addition  funding requirements for participants could increase as a result of any underfunding of this plan 
we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this creates a competitive disadvantage and negatively affects our profitability and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to third parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
many us competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
competitors that have obtained relief under bankruptcy laws may have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to the bankruptcy filing 

table of contents other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters and hot strip mills 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
usse s shipments in the fourth quarter of were reduced by outbound rail transportation service disruptions 
we may be unable to recover cost increases as we supply customers with steel under long term fixed price sales contracts 
historically approximately percent of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled product sales in the united states have been based on sales contracts with durations of at least one year 
these contracts generally have a fixed price or a price that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index 
to the extent that raw materials  energy  labor or other costs increase over the terms of the various contracts  u 
s 
steel may not be able to recover these cost increases from customers with fixed price agreements 
while u 
s 
steel may from time to time enter into forward purchase contracts to establish future prices for a portion of our requirements  we would remain at risk for our remaining requirements and would create another risk in the event that future prices decline below the prices that the forward purchases have established 
customer payment defaults could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries such as oil and gas  service center  conversion  automotive and appliance  and could experience financial difficulties in times of economic downturn 
in some cases  these difficulties may result in bankruptcy filings or cessation of operations 
if customers experiencing financial problems default on paying amounts owed to us  we may not be able to collect these amounts or recognize expected revenue 
any material payment defaults by our customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  a material payment default could cause a mandatory repayment or a reduction in the amount of receivables eligible for sale  under our receivables sale program 
the lone star and stelco acquisitions have increased our exposure to customers in many of these cyclical industries 
the terms of our indebtedness contain provisions that may limit our flexibility 
in  we entered into a five year million revolving credit facility credit facility and five year and three year term loan facilities both in the amount of million term loan facilities 
these facilities include an interest coverage ratio consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense covenant of and a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda covenant of we also issued billion of senior notes in that contain covenants restricting our ability to create liens and engage in sale leasebacks and requiring the repurchase of the senior notes upon a change of control under specified circumstances  as well as other customary provisions 
compliance with these covenants will depend upon future operating results and other factors that are at least partially outside of our control 
these covenants may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
any downgrade in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services  and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 

table of contents change in control clauses may require us to immediately purchase or repay debt 
upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  credit facility  term loan facilities  and various other contracts and leases  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately purchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
we may not have the financial resources to make these purchases and repayments  and a failure to repurchase or repay such indebtedness would trigger cross acceleration clauses under the senior notes and other indebtedness 
our foreign operations expose us to uncertainties and risks  which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
ussk  located in slovakia  usss  located in serbia  and ussc  located in canada  constitute percent of our total raw steel production capability 
both ussk and usss are subject to economic conditions and political factors in europe  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
ussc is subject to economic conditions and political factors in canada  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  government instability  civil unrest  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
any future foreign acquisitions would expose us to similar risks 
we are subject to significant foreign currency risks  which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows 
our foreign operations accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in the financial condition and results of operations of ussk  usss and ussc are reported in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the appreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated profitability 
in addition  the stelco acquisition was funded from the united states  as well as through the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings from usse  creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in different functional currencies  which can have a non cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each quarter 
a billion us dollar denominated intercompany loan to a european affiliate was the primary exposure at december  any future foreign acquisitions would expose us to similar risks 
greenhouse gas policies could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create carbon dioxide co this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
the european union eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada and the united states may also do so 
these limitations could have a negative effect on income and cash flows 
since mini mill production does not involve the same chemical reactions as integrated production  mini mills may have a competitive advantage 
also since china and many other developing nations have not instituted greenhouse gas regulations  and since past international agreements such as the kyoto protocol provided exemptions and lesser standards for developing nations  we may also be at a competitive disadvantage 
on april   canada s federal government announced an action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution 
the federal government plans to set mandatory reduction targets on all major greenhouse gas producing industries to achieve an absolute reduction of megatonnes in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by facilities existing in will be required to cut their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by percent by  with a further two percent reduction in each following year 
implementing regulations are expected to be issued for public comment in the spring of companies will be able to choose the most cost effective way to meet their targets from a range of options 
environment canada has indicated that the proposed rules will contain exemptions for fixed process gas emissions industries  including steel  for which an exemption of percent of greenhouse gas emissions is contemplated 
certain provinces have enacted climate change rules and ontario may also do so 
these limitations could have a negative effect on production levels and income and cash flows 

table of contents the european commission ec has established a co emission trading scheme for eu member countries 
under this program slovakia has received fewer co emissions allowances than it requested for both the first period through and second period through 
the slovak ministry of the environment  in turn  awarded ussk fewer allowances than ussk had requested for the first period  and has proposed to award ussk fewer allowances than requested for the second period 
ussk purchased emissions allowances to cover its shortfall for the first period and  as to future periods  we may be required to reduce ussk s production or purchase emission allowances  either of which may have a negative impact on income and cash flows 
our business requires substantial expenditures for debt service  contingent obligations  capital investment  operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund 
with  million of debt outstanding as of december   we have significant debt service requirements 
our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion 
at december   our contract commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 
the acquisitions of ussc and the former lone star facilities will increase our capital expenditure requirements 
we are also considering a billion capital investment program over a period of years at our clairton plant  and are pursuing an opportunity with an affiliate of suncoke energy  inc to construct a coke plant to supply granite city works that is contingent upon obtaining the necessary permits 
in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of raw material  raw steel and steel finishing production facilities 
as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million  guarantees of approximately million of indebtedness for unconsolidated entities and contractual purchase commitments under purchase orders and take or pay arrangements of approximately billion 
as the general partner of the clairton b partnership  lp  we are obligated to fund cash shortfalls incurred by that partnership but may withdraw as the general partner if we are required to fund in excess of million in operating cash shortfalls 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow  or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient  to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we intend indefinitely to reinvest undistributed foreign earnings overseas  however  if we need to repatriate funds in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs  the tax consequences would reduce income and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is exposed to uninsured losses 
u 
s 
steel s insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions  substantial deductibles and self insurance retentions 
our collective bargaining agreements may limit our flexibility 
the collective bargaining agreement with the usw covering the majority of represented employees at the former lone star facilities in east texas expires july   and the agreement covering the remainder of our us steel and iron ore operations expires september  the basic labor agreement 
a work stoppage would adversely impact our results of operations 
customer concern about the possibility of a work stoppage could adversely impact our relationships with our customers causing them to choose to purchase from competitors 
terms of replacement for these collective bargaining agreements could be more costly or otherwise more onerous than our current agreements 
the basic labor agreement contains provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any north american transaction involving steel or steel related assets without the consent of the usw  grants the usw a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the collective bargaining agreement  requires us to make reasonable 
table of contents and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities and requires mandatory pre funding of a trust for retiree health care and life insurance based on  among other factors  dividend and pension funding levels 
that agreement also restricts our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further requires that the ratio of non usw employees to usw employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the usw  some foreign and non union domestic producers are not subject to such requirements 
there are risks associated with the lone star and stelco acquisitions  as well as any acquisitions we may make in the future 
the lone star and stelco acquisitions were premised upon the achievement of a number of synergies that may not be obtained 
factors that may affect expected synergies from the lone star and stelco acquisitions include management s ability to successfully integrate these operations  reactions of customers and joint venture partners  operating levels in the flat rolled and tubular segments  and expansions or acquisitions by major competitors 
the lone star and stelco acquisitions created billion of goodwill on our balance sheet  which exposes us to the risk of future impairment charges 
the lone star acquisition increased our tubular production capacity percent and the stelco acquisition increased our north american steelmaking capability by percent  thereby increasing our exposure to cyclical downturns in historically cyclical industries such as oil and gas  service center  conversion  automotive  construction and appliance 
the success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms  to finance such acquisitions and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
our recent acquisitions involved prices significantly higher than the prices we paid for our acquisitions in such prices will make it more difficult to achieve adequate financial returns 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
antitrust and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from completing acquisitions 
provisions of delaware law  our governing documents and our rights plan may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our rights plan could make more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids  even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price 
we may suffer employment losses  which could negatively affect our future performance 
a significant number of u 
s 
steel s us based non union workforce will be eligible for retirement over the next several years 
over the last few years we have intensified our recruitment  training and retention efforts so that we may continue to optimally staff our operations 
failure to do so could negatively affect our future performance 

table of contents we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning erp system 
we are currently pursuing the company wide implementation of an erp system to help us operate more efficiently 
this is a complex project which would occur in several phases over the next several years 
we may not be able to successfully implement the erp program without experiencing difficulties 
in addition  the expected benefits of implementing the erp system may not be realized or the costs of implementation may outweigh the realized benefits 
the acquisitions of ussc and the former lone star facilities have made this process more complex

steel will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably 
asbestos litigation as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs claims  including cases involving businesses acquired from lone star 
at december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
during  settlements and dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately  claims and u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
new filings added approximately claims 
almost  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
of these claims  about  are pending in mississippi and over  are pending in texas 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
mississippi and texas have amended their laws to curtail mass filings 
as a consequence  most of the claims filed in and involved individual or small groups of claimants 

table of contents historically  these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel and claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of former operations of u 
s 
steel 
while u 
s 
steel has excess casualty insurance  these policies have multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has not received any payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
in most cases  this excess casualty insurance is the only insurance applicable to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises  however  with the decline in mass plaintiff cases the incidence of claimants actually alleging a claim against u 
s 
steel is increasing 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  or the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises 
u 
s 
steel has noted over the years that the form of complaint including its allegations  if any  concerning damages often depends upon the form of complaint filed by particular law firms and attorneys 
often the same damage allegation will be in multiple complaints regardless of the number of plaintiffs  the number of defendants  or any specific diseases or conditions alleged 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where we believe litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
the following table shows activity with respect to asbestos litigation over the last three years year ended december  opening number of claims claims dismissed  settled and resolved new claims closing number of claims amounts paid to resolve claims in millions the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
the vast majority of pending claims against us allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s current or former premises 
these claims are made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers 
in most cases  the claimant also was exposed to asbestos in non u 
s 
steel settings  the relative periods of exposure between u 
s 
steel and non u 
s 
steel settings vary with each claimant  and the strength or weakness of the causal link between u 
s 
steel exposure and any injury vary widely 

table of contents it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  although the resolution of such matters could significantly impact results of operations for a particular quarter 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
environmental proceedings the following is a summary of the proceedings of u 
s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of  environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites where liability is not resolved 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cleanup and remediation costs will be between million and million for one of these sites  will be between  and million per site for of these sites  and will be under  per site for nine of these sites 
at the remaining site  management estimates u 
s 
steel s share in the future cleanup costs to be million  although it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of final allocation of such costs 
that site is known as the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pennsylvania 
in october  the pennsylvania department of environmental resources pader placed the site on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation ri  which was issued in u 
s 
steel and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep signed a consent order and agreement on august   under which u 
s 
steel is responsible for remediation of this site 
in the consent order and agreement became final 
u 
s 
steel has completed the remedial design for this site and it is being reviewed by padep 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 

table of contents other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million per site 
as described below  costs for remediation  investigation  restoration or compensation are estimated to be in excess of million per site at three sites  in excess of million at one site  and in excess of million per site at two sites 
potential costs associated with remediation at the remaining four sites are not presently determinable

steel  see item a risk factors and supplementary data disclosures about forward looking statements 
overview u 
s 
steel  the fifth largest steel producer in the world and the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in north america  has a broad and diverse mix of products and customers 
u 
s 
steel uses iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions to produce a wide range of steel products  concentrating on value added steel products for customers with demanding technical applications in the automotive  appliance  container  industrial machinery  construction and oil and gas industries 
in addition to our facilities in the united states  u 
s 
steel has significant operations in canada through u 
s 
steel canada inc ussc and in central europe through u 
s 
steel kosice ussk  located in slovakia  and u 
s 
steel serbia usss  located in serbia 
u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs and product mix 
while the operating results of our various businesses are affected by a number of business specific factors  the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are general economic conditions in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other benefits costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on our ability to earn a competitive return on capital employed by implementing our strategy to become a world leader in safety and environmental performance  to continue to increase our value added product mix  to further expand our global business platform  to maintain a strong capital structure and balance sheet  to continue to improve our reliability and cost competitiveness  and to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce 
for a fuller description of our strategy  see item business description business strategy 
some of the other key issues which will impact the global steel industry  including u 
s 
steel  are the sustainability of current steel pricing trends  the cost of purchased raw materials and energy  the level of unfunded pension and other benefits obligations  the rate and sustainability of global economic growth over the next several years  the degree of further industry consolidation  the impact of production and consumption of steel in china and other developing countries  and the levels of steel imports into the markets we serve 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations  potential litigation claims and settlements  and assets and obligations related to employee benefits 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
table of contents under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
pensions and other benefits the recording of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pensions and other benefits is based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel bases its estimate of the annual expected return on plan assets on the historical long term rate of return experienced by u 
s 
steel s plan assets  the investment mix of plan assets between debt  equities and other investments  and our view of market returns expected in the future 
based on a review of these factors  u 
s 
steel maintained the expected annual return on pension plan assets for our main pension plan at percent for based on a review of similar factors for ussc pension plans  an average rate of return of percent was chosen as the expected rate for net periodic expense development 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension and other benefits liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting the domestic rates  we utilize several merrill lynch average aaa aa corporate bond indices and both the year and the year us treasury bond rates as a preliminary indication of interest rate movements and levels  and we also look to an internally calculated rate determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher rated zero coupon corporate bonds theoretically available in the marketplace 
based on this evaluation at december   u 
s 
steel maintained the discount rate used to measure domestic pension and other benefits at percent 
for ussc benefit plans  a discount rate was selected through a similar review process using canadian bond rates and indices 
as a result of this review at december   a discount rate of percent was chosen for the measurement of canadian based pension and other benefits 
u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
assumed health care cost trend rates do not have a significant effect on more than half of the liabilities reported for our health care plans since domestic united steelworkers usw participants are covered by a cost cap that was negotiated in  and which for the most part froze retiree medical costs for usw retirees after escalation applicable to the percent basic premium charged to usw retirees is a company cost whenever certain annual profit levels are met 
escalation has also been included in the actuarial calculations for the ussc health plans  for certain former national employees and their dependents  and the former mineworkers of the company 
escalation has not been calculated for most benefits for domestic non union retirees whose benefits are limited to flat dollar amounts 
for measurement of its domestic retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
for measurement of its canadian retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  including multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in compared to million in total other benefits costs in are expected to be approximately million  about the same as in 
table of contents a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and other benefits calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions of dollars expected return on plan assets incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension costs for discount rate incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension other benefits costs for pension other benefits liabilities at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in service and interest costs components for changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
for further cash flow discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
asset impairments asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of productive assets exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on management s long range estimates of market conditions and the overall performance associated with the individual asset or asset grouping 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed from businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is estimated using discounted future cash flows and  if available  comparable market values 
u 
s 
steel has determined that certain acquired intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that u 
s 
steel determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on the undistributed foreign earnings because as of december   it remains management s intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately  million 
if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss for items that have been or may be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  court case  tax ruling or other authoritative tax position  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   the total accrual for environmental remediation was million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations under statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
due to uncertainties inherent in remediation projects  it is possible that total remediation costs for active matters may exceed the accrued liability by as much as percent

table of contents segment results for flat rolled logo the decrease in flat rolled s segment income in compared to was mainly due to higher raw materials  repair and maintenance  outage and labor costs  lower shipments excluding ussc  and operating losses at ussc primarily due to curtailed iron and steelmaking operations as a result of unplanned blast furnace outages 
these were partially offset by increased average realized prices and lower costs for profit based payments

interest related to this new debt was partially offset by lower interest expense related to our senior notes  most of which we purchased in december  our senior notes that were redeemed in june  and our senior quarterly income debt securities that were redeemed in january the change also reflected lower foreign currency gains 
excluding the one time items  the million decrease from to was mainly due to favorable changes in foreign currency effects and increased interest income 
net interest and other financial costs includes foreign currency gains and losses which  through december   included amounts related to the remeasurement of ussk s and usss s net monetary assets into the us dollar  which was the functional currency for both until december  as of january   the functional currency for usse was changed from the us dollar to the euro primarily because of significant changes in economic facts and circumstances as a result of slovakia s entry into the european union eu and the subsequent entry of the slovak koruna into the exchange rate mechanism ii in preparation for slovakia s adoption of the euro 
other factors that contributed to this change are the evolution of usse into an autonomous business 
table of contents segment  the settlement of ussk s us dollar denominated debt and the establishment of euro based debt facilities 
this change in functional currency has been applied on a prospective basis and resulted in a credit to the foreign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income of million at the date of change 
after january   assets and liabilities of these entities are translated from euros to us dollars at period end exchange rates  and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
volatility in the foreign currency markets could have significant implications for u

income taxes the income tax provision in was million  compared to million in and million in the provision in included a favorable adjustment of million  recorded in the second quarter  primarily related to the refinement of assumptions used to determine the estimated tax accrual 
the provision in included a charge of million resulting from the million pre tax gain from the gary property tax settlement and a million charge resulting from the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the provisions of the slovak income tax act permit ussk to claim a tax credit of percent of the current statutory rate of percent for the years through  compared to a percent credit in previous years 
as a result of conditions imposed when slovakia joined the european union eu that were amended by a settlement with the eu  the total tax credit granted to ussk for the period through is limited to million  of which approximately million remained at december  management anticipates fully utilizing the remaining credits in it is expected that this will cause a higher effective tax rate in and subsequent years 
at december   the net domestic deferred tax liability was million 
at december   the net domestic deferred tax asset was million 
a substantial amount of u 
s 
steel s domestic deferred tax assets is related to employee benefits that will become deductible for tax purposes over an extended period of time as cash contributions are made to employee benefit plans and payments are made for retirees 
at december  and  the foreign deferred tax assets recorded were million and million  respectively  net of an established valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
net foreign deferred tax assets will fluctuate as the value of the us dollar changes with respect to the euro  the slovak koruna  the canadian dollar and the serbian dinar 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for serbian deferred tax assets because current projected investment tax credits  which must be used before net operating loss and credit carryforwards  are more than sufficient to offset future tax liabilities 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for canadian deferred tax assets due to the absence of positive evidence at ussc to support the realizability of the assets 
as ussc and usss generate sufficient income  the valuation allowance of million for canadian and million for serbian deferred tax assets as of december   would be partially or fully reversed at such time that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized

these obligations will require corporate cash in future years to the extent that trust assets are restricted or insufficient and to the extent that company contributions are required by law or union labor agreements 
amounts in the years through reflect our current estimate of corporate cash outflows and are net of the projected use of funds available from asset trusts 
the accuracy of this forecast of future cash flows depends on various factors such as actual asset returns  the mix of assets within the asset trusts  medical escalation and discount rates used to calculate obligations  the availability of surplus pension assets allowable for transfer to pay retiree medical claims and company decisions or restrictions related to our trusts for retiree healthcare and life insurance that impact the timing of the use of trust assets

steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations and similar obligations in europe  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent that these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u

however  the costs and operating 
table of contents restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers particularly in developing economies such as china and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to incur equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u

ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u 
s 
steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage our market risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas and nonferrous metals  and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities have been marked to market and the resulting gains or losses recognized in the current period in income from operations 
for future periods  u 
s 
steel may elect to use hedge accounting for certain transactions  primarily related to forecasted natural gas purchases 
for those transactions  the impact of the effective portion of the hedging instrument will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the natural gas purchase is settled 
once the purchase is settled  the effect of the hedged item will be recognized in income 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u 
s 
steel s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods  however  management believes that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the financial statements 
commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of our business  u 
s 
steel is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of steel products 
u 
s 
steel is also exposed to price risk related to the purchase  production or sale of coal  coke  natural gas  steel scrap  iron ore and pellets  and zinc  tin and other nonferrous metals used as raw materials 
u 
s 
steel s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and services and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand  however  u 
s 
steel has made forward physical purchases to manage exposure to fluctuations in the purchase of natural gas and certain non ferrous metals 

table of contents interest rate risk u 
s 
steel is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations on certain of our non derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical decrease in year end and interest rates on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments is provided in the following table dollars in millions non derivative financial instruments a fair value b increase in fair value c fair value b increase in fair value c financial assets investments and long term receivables d financial liabilities debt e f a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  notes payable  accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c reflects  by class of financial instrument  the estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates at december  and  on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments 
for financial liabilities  this assumes a percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of u 
s 
steel s long term debt at december   and december  d for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
e excludes capital lease obligations 
f fair value was based on market prices where available  or estimated borrowing rates for financings with similar maturities 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
u 
s 
steel s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio would unfavorably affect our results and cash flows only to the extent that we elected to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
at december   u 
s 
steel s portfolio of debt included billion of floating rate term loans  the fair value of which are not affected by interest rate declines 
foreign currency exchange rate risk u 
s 
steel  through usse and ussc  is subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the euro  the slovak koruna  the serbian dinar and the canadian dollar 
u 
s 
steel historically has made limited use of forward currency contracts to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations 
at december   u 
s 
steel had open euro forward sales contracts for both us dollars total notional value of approximately million and slovak koruna total notional value of approximately million 
a percent increase in the december  euro forward rates would result in a million charge to income 
subsequent to december   we increased our use of euro forward sales contracts for us dollars  which mitigates our currency exposure resulting from the billion intercompany loan discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest and other financial costs
